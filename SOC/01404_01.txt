OFFICIAL REPORT
THE SENATE
Thursday, February 5, 1925.
The Parliament of Canada having been
eumnmoned by Proclamation of the Governor
General to meet this day for the despatch
-of business:
The Senate met at 2.30 pin., the Speaker
in the Chair.
OPENING 0F THE SESSION
The Hon. the SPEAKER informed the
Senate that he had received a communication from the Governor General's Secretary
informing him that Ris Excellency the Governor General would proceed to the Senate
Chamber to open formally the Session of the
Dominion Parliament this day at 3 o'clock.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
SPEECH FROM THE TRRONE
At three o'clock Ris Excellency the Governor General proceeded to the Senate
Chamber and took bis seat upon the Throne.
Ris Excellency was pleased to command the
attendance of the House of Commons, and
that House being coule, with their Speaker,
Ris Excellency was pleased to open the
Fourth Session of the Fourteenth Parliament
of the Dominion of Canada with the following Speech:
Manourable Members of tise Senate:
Memsiers of tise Hanose cf Coimnons:
1 bave piseurs in welcoming you ta tise fourtis
session of tise faurteentis Parîlament.
Since prorogation, tise economie situation tisrougisnotably improved. For Canada,
ont tise world is
tise year 1024 was a period cf substantisl progresa.
In trade aIone, tise excessi value af exporte over imsports was more than 820,0O,000. Tise present year
opens witis prospects of caund and steedy development.
Tise financial and trade situation justifies tise expectation cf an early returu ta thea gold basic.
Tise prohiera cf tise cost of living la tise moot
important tisat my ministera bave in mmnd at tise
present tiras, and every effort i being msade ta im-

prove conditions with respect thereto. It la apparent tisat aven the most rigid economy in publie
expenditures will flot suffice to salve this pressing
problero and the probleni of taxation incidental thereta. Their ultunate solution lies largely in increased
production and thse developinent of new and wider
markets. It la to be borne continually in mmnd that
thse existing burden of taxation is due rnainly ta uncontrollable expenditure in thse nature of paymente
and obligations arising out of the War, and to the
encumnbered position of the. National Rallways.
To aid in an increase of production, through thse
develapusent of our vast natural resources, every effort
is being made to attract thse right clasa of umsgraista to Canada, and ta sacure their settiement in thse
undeveloped areas served by aur great transportation
systems. In due course ateps will be taken ta furtiser
colonization and settlement in othar fertile ragions such
as those of tisa Peace River.

bon. G. D. ROBERTSON:
Honourable
gentlemen, before the Orders of the Day are
called, I crave an opportunity on behalf of
honotîrable gentlemen on this side of tbe
bouse to express our appreciation of the
kindly and timely reference which our bonourab]e friend the leader of the Governrnent
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) made to the illness
and absence of our beloved leader last Thursday. We rejoice particularly in the faet that
the honourable member frorn Calgary (Hon.
Siu James Lougheed), who has been temporarily laid aside through illness, is now convalescing. The feelings of both sides of the
Ilouse were most fittingly expressed in the
words of my bonourable friand, and I faît
that this was probably tba best time to give
expression ta the appreciation of this side of
the bouse of his remarks on that occasion.
While on my feet may I also say that I arn
sure I vaice the feelings of the mambers of
this side of the House in exprassing our deep
regret at the bereavernent that has corne ta
His Honour the Speaker of the bouse of
Commons, and in saying that the sympatby
of the menîbers of this House goes out ta hima
and to his family at this time. I would respectfully suggest that the leader of the Government should convey the sentiments of this
House ta that honourable gentleman in order
that he may know of our sympathy for bim
at a time when probably sympathy brings
some comfort.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, it will be with great pleasure that
I will transmit to bis Honour the Speaker of

FEBRUARY 10, 1925
the House of Commons the expression of
sympathy which has fallen from the lips of
the honourable gentleman. I know that His
Honour the Speaker will very highly appreciate the kind feeling which has been expressed by the honourable gentleman, and,
which I am sure is felt by every member of
this Chamber.
THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate proceeded to the consideration
of His Excellency the Governor General's
Speech at the opening of the Session.
Hon. C. W. ROBINSON:
Honourable
gentlemen, in rising to make a somewhat
formal motion of this kind, I may say that I
took the opportunity of making rather extended notes, thinking that perhaps it would
be better for me to confine my remarks within
a narrow compass, and not to take up too
much of the time of the House. I therefore
crave the indulgence of the House if I refer
rather freely to these notes.
I know enough of the time-honoured
customs and courtesy of this august body to
realize that ample allowance will be accorded
me for any shortcomings or mistakes, and with
that knowledge I am encouraged to proceed
with the otherwise pleasant duty of moving an
Address in Reply to the gracious Speech of
His Excellency the Governor-General.
I realize too that one is hardly expected to
make any argument for or against the policy
of the Administration or the proposed legislation foreshadowed in the Speech. To do
this would tax the patience of the honourable
members at this particular time, if such were
possible, and might easily be wide of the
mark, as much of the legislation can only be
a matter of conjecture until it comes before
us in concrete form.
The Speech seems to me to sum up the
situation in Canada to-day fairly well and to
promise action along lines calculated to
strengthen our economic position as a whole.
The statement that the economic situation
throughout the world has notably improved
but reflects the conviction that trade and commerce are matters over which, even within
the bounds of our own Dominion, our Government cannot exercise absolute control. The
proverbial good times and bad times may be
and no doubt are largely the result of the
interdependence between the nations of the
world, and such a condition becomes accentuated the more a country develops its
foreign trade. Canada having a much larger
foreign trade per capita than the United
States is necessarily influenced to a correS-1½j

3

spondingly larger degree by the business conditions of countries where that trade is centred. The knowledge, then, that the conomic
situation throughout the world has notably
improved means probably more to the average Canadian citizen than the mere passing
statement of an abstract condition. It means
expansion and hopefulness, industrial development, less unemployment, increased agricultural production, a lessening of the transportation burdens, and will help to dispel the
memories of the years of depression which
have followed in the wake of the European
holocaust.
The results in Canada during 1924 are, to a
certain extent, but the corollary of the results
all over the world. The excess of our exports over imports of $260,000,000 means a
healthy condition of trade which is unusually
significant. When we add to this fact the
recent statement that Canada's net debt decreased during January by the substantial
figures of $2,274,366 and the further statement
that the buoyant character of railway traffic continues, each week exceeding the previous week,
in the face of adverse weather conditions, we
must conclude that our industrial, fiscal and
transportation interests all show signs of convalescence and we hope will soon be firmly
established in a position of unusual health
and vigour.
The day after the opening of Parliament
the reference to an early return to the gold
standard was re-echoed at the annual meeting
of Lloyd's Bank in London by J. Beaumont
Pease, the chairman showing that the hope
expressed by His Excellency is well within
the range of reasonable probability and conforms to the opinion of the highest banking
and financial men in the Empire.
The conditions of exchange are a source of
bewilderment to 'the
average citizen, but
business men know thalt the uncertainties of
the exchange market and the depressed condition of the money of some European
countries, including Great Britain, have had a
most injurious effect upon our foreign trade
and in many cases greatly reduced the volume
of our exports. As an example, our lumbermen of the Maritime Provinces and Quebec
have for a long time been buoyed up with the
hope that some relief from the trying conditions under which they have been operating
may be afforded by the return of the pound
sterling to par. The re-establishment of the
gold basis will be the only guarantee of such
a condition permanently assured.
The announcement of Lloyd's chairman that "the
only real problem for us is the precise date
when we can safely re-establish a free market
in gold," will therefore serve to strengthen.

along this line stagger the imagination. The
vast pre-Cambrian shield which covers so
many thousands of square miles of Ontario,
Quebec, and the Western Provinces, coupled
with the use of the water-power which nature
has so Javishly provided at hand, promise
for Canada a mining industry which will be
truly colossal.
And not mining alone, but all the industries, the home and the farm, the conditions and the cost of living-all are benefited
whether by
by such hydro development,

And so it is that, notwithstanding the financial difficulties of both governments and
individuals all through these difficult years,
Canada bas been putting her house in order,
and to-day ber potential position is immeasurably improved -over what it was but a few
years ago.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON.

To govern under post-war conditions has
been a most difficult task. To carry on with
the minimum of friction, and so direct the
hehm of the ship of state that in spite of
adverse winds and turbulent cross-currents we
may gradually approach nearer the desired
haven, has been no ordinary task. For any
government to succeed is almost a miracle,
and without any undue flattery I may express
the modest opinion that the present Government deserves some meed of commendation
for having se far successfuily avoided the
reefs and rocks which everywhere lay in the
course of our voyage.
In referring to hydro-electric development
I want to take opportunity to refer to investigations that have been taking plice during
the past year at the confluence of the Petitcodiac river with the Memramcook river in
the Province of New Brunswick. We have
there a very important and interesting power
possibility which is unique and unlike any so
far constructed in the known worid, somewhat similar to proposed Severn barrage which
is at the present time engaging the attention
of the Government of Great Britain, and> on
is
which investigation that Government
spending about half a million dollars. There
is the difference that the physical conditions
in New Brunswick and the extreme rise and
fall of the tide, averaging around thirty-five
feet, make the cost per horse-power developed
probably a mere bagatelle as compared with
the cost of the proposed Severn development.
I believe that there are great possibilities
there, and that the feasibility of a development in connection with the Canadian National Railways should receive most carefui
study at the hands of the Water-power Branch
of the Dominion Government. It is too huge
a proposition for a smali Province, and is as
important to the Province of Nova Scotia
and the Canadian National Railways as it
is to New Brunswick. There is no record of
any large development of tidal power, and the
opportunities for such develqpment are very
unusual. No question of watershed, storage
dams or rainfall need to be considered. As an
advertising medium alone it might be worth
while for Canada, and what would it mean
to the Maritime Provinces that sadly negiected paradise of the Atlantic ieeaboard, to
feel the impetus and the throb of a new life
on the release of 200,000 horse-power now îying
dormant and ready to respond to the advances
of any daring and courageous Government.
The proposed legisliation having for its
object the equalization of freight rates by land
and sea gives promise of remedying a real
political malady which is seriously affecting

FEBRUARY 10, 1925
the health of the body politic. With the unequal rates and in many cases wbat seem to
be excessive rates affecting -the operation. of
our railroads and restricting the trade of our
8e54,orts, we are in a cond!ition economi4ially
very much like that of soine human beinga:
we are suffering from a sort of arterial seferosis. As a resuJt the whole fystem is affeoed.
In the case of the individual the remedYT is
only partial, but in the case of a Vtate it is
possible to have a coiniplete cure if the case
is properly diagnosed and the phYsician gives
the proper -treatment. The transportation
system both by land and water must function
freely, tboroughly and qcientificaâiY in order
to keep the health of the 'business of the
state just as surel'y as a mfan's arterial system11
controls bis bodilY bealtb.
Here liles a theme whicb bas unusual
interest to aIl parts of our country. It brings
Up to our minds the question of differentials,
tbe Crowsnest Pass agreement, the wholefel
of railway operation and control, labour
organizations, the development of our ports,
branch lines, marketing our coal in Canada,
marketing our wheat in Europeý,, and a host
of matters of a more local nature. Down
in the Maritime Provinces, that particular
part of this Dominion where it is my good
fortune to have been born, and rnost of the
time to live and move and have my being,
I somneimes think tbat, we wo'ild be better
off without such good transportation facilities
between us and tije rest of Canada. Most
of the money which :-,e earn from shipping
lumber and fish to tiic United States is
banded over to tbe manufacturers of Ontario
and Quebec to pay for the good8 whicha the
Canadian National Railway bau!s for them 90
cheaply while our own smalýl industries Ianguish and die; but that is a condition to
which we have become accustomed. Maritime
rights is a sbibboletb to-day icih spelîs
trouble for almost any Government in power.
Always a smouldering fire, it wag kindled into
flame by the removal of the Audit Office witb
its two bundred employees from Moncton to
Montreal by the Canadian National Railway,
coupled with tbe consequent unrest and fear
of furtber action along that line. Wbile
willing to give tbe Management credit for a
real effort to save cost of operation and bring
co-ordination, I amn not at aIl convinced that
either -object was accomplisbed by the change
referred to. On the ether hand, it bas seriously
affected the prosperity and happiness of quite
a large community.
With this passing reference to local conditions, I returni for a f ew moments to the
To
question of rates of transportation.
properly round out our Dominion and

5

strengthen the bonds of union 'between the
provinces, it seems of the utmost importance
that the Canadian ports on both the Atlantic
and Pacifie seaboards should handie our
foreign trade outside of 'the United States.
On the Pacifie coast there seeme to be no
problem. The Canadian trade goes .natural-ly
to Canadian ports to be there loaded into
ocean-going steamers or sailing ships, either
for the Pacifie trade or the Atlantic trade as
the case may be. On t.he Atlantic seaboard
we have a number of good ports and harbours, some only open in summer, others the
year round, and yet in spite of this facit we
allow a very large part of our trade to contribute to the upkeep of ports in the United
States as far south as New OrîcanQ. In the
meantime, our own ports of Halifax and St.
John axe allowed to languish.
I it any wonder, thani, that we hear mutterings from the Maritime Provinces? There
must be somne remedy for this condition.
During the war period- we would have been
in a sorry p'light without these winter ports.
Le it fair onay to use them as a convenience?
While it is truc that goods will travel where
rates are the cheapest, that to my mind
points the way to the remedy, and the proposed 'legislation to control the water rates
as well as the land rates opens up a land of
promise to our people down by the sea. To
make the rates such that the West may
receive the very best resuits from the fruit
of its toil will materially help that great part
of our country, nlot to mention the benefits
of im.proved transportation rates to the
country as a whole; and to control shipments
so that they must pass through our own
ports will bring relief and hope to the citizens
of St. John and Halifax in common with the
other Atlantic ports of Canada.
I know nothing of the details of the propoqed legislation beyond what bas been foreshadowed in the newspapers, and I arn merely
pointing out the lines along which. something
may be done of vast importance te one of
the oldest sections of oui common country.
It is a conrageous step and invites criticism,
but I trust the object sought may not be lest
sight of. Something of that nature is of vital
necessity if the people of the Maritimes are
not to lose ail confidence ini the good faith of
the rest of Canada.
That particular part of the Speech which
foreshadows a conference between ýhe
Dominion -and ail the Provinces of Canada for
the purpose of considering amendments te
the British North America Act is not an
unusuai procedure. There have been various
amendinents in tbe past, and some of those
amendments were made, I believe, without

SENATE
taking all the Provinces into consideration.
This method to my mind is rather a dangerous one. About the year 1912 there was a
readjustment of subsidies to some of the
Provinces. Manitoba was the largest beneficiary at that time. The Province of Prince
Edward Island, the Garden of the Gulf, by
reason of its often importunities, received
an extra $100,000. Other Provinces thought
they had good claims, but I have never
discovered that they were even consulted.
Extensions of boundaries have been made in
the case of both Ontario and Quebec, and I
wonder if there was any conference at that
time. There ýare no doubt many questions
which varions Provinces will want to have
discussed at this interprovincial Dominion
gathering. I have in mind some problems
which I know nre in the ninds of some of the
Provinces. and a thorough discussion ought
to do a whole lot of good.
As to the refori of the Senate, my length
of service in that body does not fit me very
well to proffer any advice. I should suppose
that no great harm couild come from following the experience of the mother country in
the reformiation of the House of Lords. From
observation during my short experience in
this Cliamber I have been struck with the
conspicuous ability displayed by the leaders
and many of the supporters on both sides, if
there are really two sides in this Chamber. I
suppose it is hardly possible to expeet experienced politicians to at once lay aside
every suspicion of partizanship upon passing
through the .portals of the Senate, but the
more successful we are in doing so the more
we will no doubt contribute to establish our
position in the country as an honourable and
useful bodv. Like the emergency brake on
the automobile, the time for independent
action may not often arise, but when it does
it may avoid a catastrophe.
Democratic government under the aegis of
the British Crown is probably the best this
old world has ever devised, and the bicameral
system has never yet been successfully supplanted by any other scheme. There are
weaknesses of nmany kinds in that system
and no doubt there always wi]l be. If we
couid institute a reform in the qualification
of the members of both Houses, so as ,to have
only real students of politica:1 economy
eligible, it might be a good thing.
In dealing with the body politic, there is
an ana'logy in the method of dealing with
the human body. In a wav we are a collage
of political physicians and surgtons attempbing to diagnose and to cure without any
special qualifications in nany cases. If we
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON.

were to establish some such qualifications and
compel all who would be politicians to pass
a proper test before being enrolled upon the
register, what a change there would be in the
methods of conducting Parlianent, what a
reduction there would be in the pages of
Hansard, and how the demagogues would
scream-but why indulge in idle dreams about
reformation?
I have the honour to move, seconded by
the Honourable Mr. Tessier:
That the following Address be presented to His
Excellency the Governor General to offer the humble
thanks of this House to His Excellency for the gracious
Speech which he has been pleased to make to both
Hoses of Parliament; namely:T0 General His Excellency the Riglit Honourable
Julian Herdworth George, Baron Bng of Vimy, General
on the Retired List and in the Reservc of Officers of
the Arma; Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath; Knight Grand Cross of the
Most Diatinguished Order of Saint Micharl and Saint
George; Member of the Royal Victorian Order, Governor General and Commander-in-Chief of the Dominion
of Canada.
May it Please Your Excellency:
We, Hs Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects.
the Senate of Canada, in Parliament assembled, beg
eave to offer our humble thanks to Your Excellency
for the gracious Speech which Your Excellency has
addressed ta both Houses of Parliament.

Hon. JULES TESSIER (Translation):
I
have the honour to second the motion for
an Address in reply to the Speech of His
Excellency, and T request the indulgence of
this honourable House.
After the ddificult years through which we
have passed, it is gratifying to hear His
Excellency annouînce that progress has been
made in our foredgn trade; that we have considerably decreased our imports and increased
our exports, and have an excess in our favour
of $260,000,000. Aill economists predict that
business will improve in 1925.
This opinion is shared in New York and
London. A crisis has been experienced in the
textile industry in Canada, but it has been less
acute than that which has prevailed in England and the United States, where some of the
cotton factories have been cilosed, while ours
are working under better conditions.
We
now see that Canadians, who for a few years
hlave been attracted to the United States by
the inducenent of higher wages, are returning
in rather large numbers.
The condition of the farmers, in the West
as well as in the East, is improved, and if
only there is a good crop this year the purchasing power of our people will restore the
activitv of our industries.
If industrial and agricultural prosperity ýprevails, it will be of great advantage to oui
railways and our seaports.

FEBRUARY 10, 1925
The people of the West have long complained of the difficulty of acces Vo the 8ea,
because of the great distance their products
have Vo be hauled. The opening of the Panama Canal an'd the equipment of the Port of
Vancouver wil1 enable Alberta to make use
of this nearer outiet, whioh. is open ail the
year round, for the shiipment, of its products
at a more favourable rate. The products Vo
be shipped from Saskatchewan and Manitoba
Vo Europe can be, in our opinion, transported
more pro-fitaýbly on the Transcontinental via
Quebec.
The Government's programme indicates its
intention to equalize freight charges, to control ocean rates, to improve the facilities of
oux harbours on the St. Lawrence, the Atlantic
and the Pacifie. Attention is Vo be devoted
also to the question of immigration and the
encouragement of colonization in the Peace
River Distýrict. I may mention also the announcement of a conference between the
Federal and Provincial governments Vo coneider the amending of the constitution of the
Senate.
The carrying out of the programme outlined is full of promise for the future.
When it js 'borne in mind that our dollar,
like that of the United %ates, is at par,
while the Pound sterling is stîli depreciated
and the franc of a rich and economical country like France is worth only one-third of
its normial 'value, we ought noV to be too
Pessi-isgtie. Why is it, thougli, thlat in spite
of our favourable trade -balance of 820,000,000
business depression continues, there is sVill
reluotance about rieking capital in new enterprises, and, because of this lack of confidence,
we have unemployment? Where is the money
that has come into this country as a resuit
of last year~s surplus cf exports over importe?
We have macle the mistake of paying Vo the
United States 8100,000,000 for their coal while
-e possess in this country un uniimited eupply.
Furthermore, we have paid at least 820,000,000 Vo railways of the United States, Vo their
vessels on the Great Lakes, Vo their elevators,
Vo their stevedores and workmen, in connection with the transportation cf our grain by
way cf Buffalo and New York, instead of
sendling it to our own ports Iby our own railways. This money je lcst to the country,
and this practice has been the cause of much
criticism and dissatisfattion.
The officiai statistical report, reproduced in
Le Soleil, cf Quebec, shows the quantities of
Canadian grain exported during tlhe crop year
ended Auguet 31, 1924, as follows:

7

Bushels Bushels
To the United States
for home consumption
and milling.....
21,000,000

....

2,500,000 73,000,000
To Vancouver for export.....
..

54,000,000

289,000,000
During the same period the freight. rates
from Fort William Vo tihe St. Lawrence and
Vo Buffalo, respectively, have been as follows:
Average
per bushel
To Montreal by water......9ý, cents
To Québec by water.........11
To Buffalo by water.........
cc
To Montreal and Québec by rail 21
When the Transcontinental was first opened
for traffic the rate from Fort William Vo
Montreal and Québec was 6 cents a bushel.
The present rate of 21 cents being prohibitive, trafflo has been diverted Vo the boats at
Fort William, whence it takes the cheaper
route to Buffalo and New York. As the
ocean rate from New York Vo Europe je onthe average 3 cents a bushel -lesm than that
from Montreal Vo Europe, and a there are
more favourable terme for maritime insurance
on the New York route, we are deprived of
our legitirnate trade. In failing Vo secure
this enortnous export business we are losing
the profite involved in the handling of twothirds of our wheat shipments. IV is an immense trade, equal in volume Vo the Votai
exporte of grain from Montreal.
There is nothing surprising in the fact that
the farmers of the West and the people in
our seaports are unanimous in their criticism
of a system so disastrous. It was condemned
hy the Senate of Canada in June, 1922, after
a thorough inquiry. IV is compelling the
producer to pay exorbitant rates and je taking away from our railways a revenue of
fifteen or- twenty million dollars, which might
well be spent in providing a livelihood for
our railway employees instead of those on
the prosperous route between Buffalo and
New York. Furthermore, this 'policy deprives our seaports, especially Quebec, Halif ax and St. John, as well as Montreal, of a
maritime trade which they have been justified in expecting since the Transcontinental

SENATE
Railway was constructed by the Government

in 1904. It was understood at that time that
the grain of the West would be carried by
rail te Canadian ports, which would be
properly equipped to accommodate it. It is
my belief that the proposal contained in the
Speech from the Throne for the equalization of
freight rates is an evidence of the intention
te carry out the policy of Laurier and to
remedy the present injustice. Why should
we pay 21 cents a bushel for the hauling of
wheat from Fort William te Montreal or
Quebec, when the rate for an equal distance
west of Fort William is only 11 cents?
As for the control of ocean rates, could
anything be fairer than to recognize a saving in distance by making a proportionate
reduction in the charges? But what do we
find? Halifax is almost 700 miles nearer to
Liverpool than is New York; Quebec is
nearer by 500 miles, and Montreal by 350.
Nevertheless the steamship combine, who
make huge profits, charge 3 cents a bushel
more to carry our wheat from Montreal to
Europe than the rate from New York.
The Government is to be congratulated on
having taken the intitiative for the control
of ocean rates. Let us hope that it will prevail upon the insurance underwriters to
charge equal insurance rates to vessels sailing in Canadian and those sailing in American waters.
As te the improvement and equipment of
our harbours on the eastern and the western
seaboards and on the St. Lawrence, it is
evident that the trade will net be satisfied
unless those ports are provided with aIl the
facilities necessary to enable them to meet
the requirements of modern navigation.
Grain production in the West is now eight
times greater than it was twenty years ago.
While there is need for rigorous economy in
public expenditure, it must be remembered
that the loss of our grain trade is as costly
to us as it is profitable to our neighbours to
the south. The solution of this problem is
urgent.
That the Government is occupied in solving the problem is shown by the fact that at
Vancouver, Prince Rupert and Montreal
elevators and docks are in course of construction. Work for the improvement of the port
is in progress at Quebec, which a few years
ago turned over to the Government properties valued at two million dollars. I understand that the West and the Great Lakes
country are equipped with elevators and warehouses having a storage capacity of 200,000,O0 bushels of wheat, while the eastern ports
of Montreal, Quebec, Halifax and St. John
can accommodate only 20,000,000 bushels.
Hon. Mr. TESSIER.

Buffalo is also very well equipped in this
respect-partly, I am told, by the expenditure of Canadian money.
As to the harbour of Quebec, it suffers an
injustice from the fact that the railway companies charge a higher freight rate on
goods shipped there froin Ontario or the West
than they do on the same goods shipped to
Montreal, alleging that they must receive additional compensation for the longer haul;
while, on the other hand, the steamship companies charge on goods at Quebec the same
rate as at Montreal. Thus the port of Quebec
is placed in an unfavourable and unfair position as regards the "through rate," that is,
the combined railway and ocean charges,
though the total mileage is the same. Obviously
this intolerable situation requires to be remedied.
By the construction of the National Transcontinental Quebec is brought 214 miles nearer
Winnipeg than is Montreal. The railway was
built for the purpose of uniting the provinces
of the West and those of the East and opening
a new route for the movement of western products to Europe, with Quebec as the eastern
terminus.
The Transcontinental, though completed
several years ago, has not yet been used for
the transportation of grain. Let us hope that
the time will come when this line, constructed
at great cost and sacrifice, will be utilized to
meet the requirements of steadily developing
trade.
Quebec, being the summer terminus of the
principal railway lines that traverse our country, and having one of the largest natural
ports in America, owned by the taxpayers of
Canada, is -destined to accommodate in the
near future a greater number of vessels of
large tonnage sailing on the St. Lawrence
route. The biggest ocean-going vessels can
enter that port at any stage of the tide.
The prosperity of the port of Quebec has
been retarded for many years by the lack of
facilities and by the prohibitive rates charged
by the transportation companies. The Gevernment, by means of the proposed developments at Wolfe's Cove, will remove one of
these drawbacks. It is hoped that in the readjustment of railway rates on goods for export, as announced by the Government, justice will be donc te the port of Quebec. In that
way the Government will help to place that
port on a solid business basis and enable it
to compete on an equal footing with other
Canadian ports.
It must net be forgotten that the harbours
of Quebec and Montreal are both necessary
in the transportation of Canadian products by

FEBRUARY 10, 1925
the St. Lawerence route, and that the traffic
originating in Canada is ample te keep these
fine ports working at fuli capacity without
hsanpering each other.
Statictica prove conclusively that more than
haif the wlieat crop of Canada is shipped eacb
year by United States ports.
The Canadian West has ibeený supplied, iu
the course of yeaas, with grain elevators
having a total capacity cf about 200,000,000
bushela, wbereas the elevater capacity at
eastern Canadian ports ta about 20,'000,'000

brave men and good Christians, and they sowed
traditions whirh have been preserved by our
good people of the Province of Quebec. I
am sure that the Federal authorities will spare
no effort te bring in good, healithy people.
I have read in the newspapers of the desire to have a new railway built in the Peace
River valley.
I trust that this proposal will
not be carried out too hastily, and that if it
is decided to build new lines it will be borne
in mind that the Province of Quebee has only
half the railway mileage to which it is entitled in proportion to its population, and that
we have fertile districts in which settlers are
far removed from any highwny.
Among
others may be mentioned the district north
of Lake St. John, Mistassini and Peribonka,
where nearly ten thousand settlers are awaiting the establishment of rail communications.
In the Speech from the Throne allusion has
been made te the reform of the Senate. Permit me te say that it will require very strong
arguments and reasons, which have net been
given yet, te convince us of the need for this
reform.
The intent of the Act of Confederation, in
creating this branch of Parliament, was te
constitute a judicial bodt whose duty it
should be te protect minorities and large institutions in such a way as would guarantee
their rights or their stability, and te revise
legislation passed sometimes too hastily by
the House of Commons. This is a bulwark
against the encroachments of popular passion.
Composed for the most part of men whose
merit has been recognized by the electorate,
and who have been chosen from among the
leaders of professional, commercial or agriculteral bodies, the Senate has net proved
unworthy since Confederation. The door of
public life has been opened te many of us by
the people, whom we shall continue te serve
in this Chamber. It was the wish of the
Fathers of Confederation that the Senate
should have in its ranks Ministers with portfolios, and until recent years it was customary
te give us Ministers at the head of very important departments of government. It seems
te me that this tradition should not have
been interrupted.
We have at present as
leader of this Chamber a distinguished gentleman who is eminently well qualified te administer the most important department. He
possesses general esteem, and I have no doubt
that we should be highly gratified te see his
promotion. It would be only doing justice
te him and te this honourable House.
We are pleased te note in the Speech from
the Throne that the Government intends te

submit for approval by Parliament a Treaty
between the United States and Canada to
secure improvement in the administration of
laws respecting smuggling and the prosecution
and extradition of persons violating the antinarcotic laws of either country. We congratulate the Government on having taken this
initiative, and alse our distinguished Minister
of Health, Hon. Dr. Béland, on the courageous
stand he took at Geneva on the occasion of
the conference called for the study of this
question.
Chosen chairman of one of its
committees-an honour te himself as well as
to Canada-he supported the opinion that the
only solution of the problem would be to restrict the production of opium te the quantity
necessary for legitimate medicinal purposes,
thus striking at the root of the evil. Intelligent and persevering work is being carried
on in the Department of Health by Dr. Amyot
and his assistants for the purpose of combating
the scourge of the narcotic habit. Those who
have followed the energetic efforts they are
making te prevent illicit entry and the hateful
traffic in these pernicious drugs are grateful
for what the Department is doing te protect
our country frorm this terrible evil.
Canada has taken its place at the great
international conferences which have been held
in Europe, and our representatives have given
proof of training and knowledge equal te
those of the delegates of other nations. We
have taken an important step towards autonomy in ourselves signing for Canada certain
treaties with the United States, and it is
announced that in a short time Canada will
bh officially represented at Washington by
a diplomat chosen from among the members
of this Chamber-a man who has played a
distinguished part in our political life. It is
the duty of our statesmen te co-operate with
those who would banish the hideous spectre
of war and bring about the reign of peace
for the progress and happiness of humanity.
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON:
Honourable
gentlemen, may I beartily congratulate the
mover and the seconder of this Address
because of the very interesting remarks that
tbey have made and the instructive information which they have laid before the House?
Particularly, may I refer te the remarks of
the honourable member from Moncton (Hon.
Mr. Robinson), because I must confess my
inability to intelligently follow the seconder
of the motion (Hon. Mr. Tessier) in his
language, and ask him to pardon any omission
or failure te refer te what he has said, because of that inability on my part.
My honourable friend from Moncton, whom
we have been delighted te listen te for the

FEBRUARY 10, 1925
first time ini an extended address, is a gentleman who lias rendered, conspicioue publie
service in his own Province, and I amn sure
lie wil'l do credit to and be an ornament to
this House. No reference to my honourable
friend who seconded the motion is necessary,
because his experience and abiity and judgment are s0 well known to this House that
we always greet lis utterances witli pleasure.
I admired tlie frankness and fairness of the
honourable gentleman from Moncton, in pointimg out that at the beginning of tlie Speech from
the Throne it is etated that the world economic
situation lias improved during the past year.
Then lie assures us that tlie Government of
Canada does not assume credit for that
That I mark as a frank
improvemnent.
admission of fact. In the next sentence of
the flrst paragraph of the Speech from the
Throne a statement is made in which my
bonourable friend concurred, and which, whule
true, in my humble opinion does not imply
or carry with it ail the encouragement that
miglit he taken from it. It is stated that
the year 1924 wvas a period of substantial
progress in Canada . and that the value of our
exporte over imports for that year amounted
to 8260,000,000.
My honourable friend, however, perhî.ps
overlooked the fact that that apparently
satisfactory condition was hrought about by
reason of the feet that our imports during
the year 1924 fell fro.m '$907,000,000 to $812,000,000, a drop of $95,000,000, which of course
automnatically increased the margin of exports
over importe. It therefore follows that if
our imports--whicli in other words means the
ability of our people to purchase from their
neiglibours in other countries--continue to,
fali to the extent of another $95,000,000 or
$100,000,000 next year, it will probably again
be said, aithougli our exports increased, not
at al, tha t the condition is substantia-lly
further improved. I therefore muet accept
with reservations the statement that an excees
of exports over importe indicates national
prosperity.
I wiil have occasion later on to make some
mention of the trade convalencence and the
convalescence of our transportation systeme
to whicli the honourable gentleman lias referred. I miglit agree with him that the ship
of state lias had perhaps as turbulent a voyage
during the last ten years as during the pa.st
threýe. But one recails the fact that about a
yeir -ago or lese the captain was ringing the
belîs of freer trade and the mate was ringing
the knell of protection, and the slip of state
waa preparing to sail away on its voyage to
the freer ports, and we were to have a freer
interchange of goods with other nations; but

i

the expectations which the people experienced,
and which they had a right to entertain, have
flot been altogether realized. Notwithstanding
the fact that therehlas been atendency towards
freer trade by means of a reduction in tariff
duties, in order to make the flow of international
trade more easy, and, as the Government said,
to reduce the cost of living, this policy lias flot
worked out as I arn sure the Government

and that the Government itself is flot sure
whether it has been a successful one or flot;
so that during the present Session of Parliament there is no intention of any further move
in that direction, but rather the Government
are contemplating changing the course of the
ship of state and sailing away on another
mission, namely, an attempt to control the
f reiglit rates on the waters of the world.
The Speech fromn the Throne says: "The
year 1924 was a period of substantial proOne should stop to consider just

When we
what that progrees lias been.
speak of national progress, especially in a
young country such as this is, we naturally
think of an expansion of trade, of an increase
in our productions of ail sorts, of an increase
in our national revenues, of a better relation
between revenues and expenditures, of increased population, of a decreased cost of
living and an improved condition of the
-people generally, by reason of constantlyincreasing values of properties that they own;
and one of the questions that must for many
years anise in the minc of a Canadian. is
whether or not our greaýt national railway
undertaking lias been making progress forward
or backward.
Let us for a moment consider some of these
important points in order to reacli a conclusion as to whether or not Canada made
substantial progress in 1924. When we coneider that tlie total export and import trade
of Canada for the year just past is forty-eight
and a haîf million dollars less than it was for
the corresponding period one year previous,
we can hardly put that down as an indication
of substantial progress. With regard to Canada's revenues, when w'e find the Canada
Gazette, the official Government publication
issued just a few days ago, showing that the
revenues of this country for the ten montha'

period since the 1st of April are fifty and
three quarter million dollars less than they
were for the same period the year before, we
are justified in thinking that the drop in
revenues for the twelve months' period will

be approximately $f6O,000,O00.

If the nation,

like a business concern with falling gross
earnings, is able to reduce its operating
expenses to the same extent, so that at the
end of a certain period it obtains the same
net results, then one must confess that we
are at least holding our own; but this record
indicates that the expenditures for the ten
months of the fiscal year just past are only
$429,000 less than :they were for the same

period the year before.
saving of $429,000 in expenditures, and a loss
of over S50,000,000 in revenues, one is hardly
justified in saying that 1924 was a prosperous
year.
Perhaps our population has increased. If
the burdens to be borne by the people of any
country can be spread over a larger number
each succeeding year, then the burden upon
each individual becomes correspondingly less.
What is the situation with reference to 1924
The statement of the Bureau
in that regard?
of Statisties, which is attached to the Department of Trade and Commerce, indicates that
in the fiscal year ending April, 1924, which
makes a better showing for the Governl

United States officials tell us by their records
that 181,973 people emigrated from Canada
to the United States. In other words, we lost
approxinately 33,000 more than we received,
and we spent d'uring that twelve months upon
immigration the sum of $3,482,000, as shown
in the Publie Accounts distributed among
the members this morning. Therefore the
net result is that we spent three and a half
million dollars to accomplish a reduction in
population. That can scarcely be pointed to
as an indication of prosperity or advancement during the year. It may be, however.
that the people who are here have prospered;
it may be that the value of your home, of
your business property, of your farm, bas
substantially increased dring the past year.
Each of us might answer that for himself;
but I am greatly mistaken if it is not true,
generally speaking, that values have gone
down rather than up.

hood. In that connection we find that even
during the latter part of July and the early
part of August, the midsummer months, the
Federal Government found it necessary to
call an Unemployment Conference on the
3rd of September last to consider and consult
with representatives of the municipalities and
the provinces as to what should be done to
aid the unemployment situation which then
existed and which promised to become more
acute as the year advanced. If the country
was so prosperous, and things were advancing so steadily and progressing so nicely, I
would think it very unusual in the middle of
the summer to foresee a situation which
would necessitate the calling of such a conference. I will not weary the House at this
time by going into a detailed analysis of
the situation at this moment, but I will say
that- it is serious. and that we have had
evidence of that fact constantly coming in
during the last ten days. Therefore, with
181,000 people going from our country in a
single year, and with the unemployment situetion more serions than it was a year ago, it
cannot be said that tihe condition of the
country is prosperous, or that it has advanced
during the year. The workmen, in addition
to being largely unemployed, have found
themselves in many cases obliged to accept
decreased earnings because of the inability of
the employers to pay more or of industry to
bear a higher cost.
All this reflects upon the ability of the consumer to purchase even the necessaries of life
in many cases. The country was told a year
ago that the reductions and alterations which
were made in the tariff were to reduce the
cost of the implements of production and the
cost of foods, and that this would result in a
decrease in the cost of living to the consumer.
Thousands, indeed hundreds of thousands, of
people in this country, feeling the burden of
the higi cost of living, looked with hope, and
some with confidence, to the working out of
that panacea. What has been the result? The
cost of living during the year has advanced,
according to the Department of Labour's own
record, and according to the records of the
Bureau of Statistics. No one can gainsay that
i, is truc, according to the Government's own
records, that the cost of living is higher today than it was a year ago. Therefore reductiens in tariff have apparently not effected a
reduction in the cost of living.
Just in passing, honourable gentlemen, let
me point to a few object lessons which speak
to me muci more forcibly than theoretical
reasoning on this subject possibly could. Here

reaped, and year after year thousands of men,
largely young men, have gone to the West
and helped in the harvest, and the harvest
has been saved. In 1919 an effort was made
through governmental action to supply more
systematicalIy the harvest help required and
to distribute it intelligentdly, and since that
time labour has been supplied in that way,
with more or less success. But I desire to
point out the very serious situation that
existed last year at harvest time, or immediately preceding it. I think the matter is
worthy of mention, to the end that the
Government may avoid, if possible, during
1925, a repetition off so unfortunate a situation, and withhold supply until required.
In the ýcourse of my duties in another connection I travel considerably, and I happened
to be in the city of Moose Jaw on the third
Sunday in August last and there saw a situation that to me was lamentable. There were
about 800 harvesters from Eastern Canada
in the city of Moose Jaw on that day. They
had been there for nearly a week. That
evening another train Io-ad arrived. There
was nothing for any of them to do,
and most of them had little and many
of them no money. Along the main street of
the city of Moose Jaw there is a boulevard
ten or twelve feet wide, between the street
proper and the sidewalk. It is a grass plot.
Lying along that boulevard like sticks of wood
were hundreds of men without any other beds
and in many cases without the wherewithal
to purchase a meal, and waiting-for what?
For an opportunity to work. Beautiful fields
of wheat all over that district were just beginning to ripen. None of them were ready
to cut, and they would not be for about a
week yet. A little cutting had commenced on
the Portage Plains, but nothing in Saskatchewan. The scene that presented itself to me
reminded me of dry summers in the early
days, when as a boy I had to pasture the
cows on the road, though inside the fence
there were beautiful crops of hay, wheat,
etc., which they would like to have but
could net reach. And se those human anirmals
were there in want, perhaps unknown to many
Western farmers who in a few days would
need their services. I hold that there ought
to be closer co-operation between the people
who require labour and the .Government, who
are attempting to supply it, to the end that
the requirements may be served properly and
without such distress and such disgraceful
conditions as existed at that time. If a
proper relation is to be maintained and
strengthened between the people of the East
who want te go West to see the country
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

and to help in gathering the harvest and the
people of the West who need this assistance,
then that sort of occurrence must not happen
again.
A r-ailroad conductor with whom I am personally acquainted, and who made a very
interesting speech in the Saskatchewan Legislature the other day, told me personally that
he had had fifty-two men on his train travelling on the brake-beams and in the box cars
from station to station the week before, looking for a chance to obtain a meal or board
until their services were required in the
harvest fields, and they were not receiving
any response that would keep them fed until
they were needed.
I want to refer in that connection to one
other incident. It occurred a few weeks afterwards. The unenployment conference called
by the Government te which I have referred
was held here on the 3rd of September. I
am net criticising the results, but they were
net very extensive. During the time that
conference was in session a telegram came
in and was read, stating that 2,000 more men
were wanted in the harvest fields-at a time
when I knew there was a surplus. Now, bonourable gentlemen, that is not playing the
game, and I say frankly to the Government
and anybody eonnected with it that attempts
to make human beings the pawns in a game
of that sort is net fair.
The Government in its wisdom bas included in the Speech from the Throne the
statement that the problem of the cost of
living is the most important one in the minds
of His Excellency's advisers at this time and
that every effort is being made to improve
conditions with respect thereto.
I assume
that it means that, but I may say frankly
that there are many people in the country
who are accepting it with reservations, because of the faet that, although similar interest in the same subject was most emphatically voiced six years ago, yet, three
years later the present Government came
into power and, although it has since been
administering the affairs of this country and
bas had opportunity to give attention to this
matter and effect a remedy, the cost of living
has net decreased. I do net think that the
new panacea that it is proposed this year to
experiment with, namely, to seek to control
ocean freight rates, which follows in the
next paragraph of the Speech from the Throne,
as the remedy to bring about the desired
results, is going to accomplish what is expected.
There have been freight rate wars on land
and sea from time to time for many years.
The Government of Canada has net yet very

FEBRUARY 10, 1925
successfuldy accomplished the task of controlling freight rates on land. There is much
to be donc there stilH. But when it undertakes, with a few inadequate tools at its
command, to control the commerce on the
high seas, I am afraid that it is facing an
impossible task. I would point out to the
Government also that there is a good deal of
risk involved. The control of commerce on
the high seas is a big undertaking. It involves serious responsibility, and if perchance
it became necessary to proteot the traffic by
calling out the Canadian Navy, and perhaps
other forces, in defence of the Government's
action in controlling commerce on the high
seas, it might result in a very complicated
situation.
But let us consider seriously for a moment
the effect, even though Euccess may be attained. Let us grant for the moment that
the Government does succeed in putting on
and subsidizing a fleet of steamships, as is
suggested in the information before us, for
the purpose of carrying a substantial quantity, i'f not the major portion, of Canada's
products to foreign markets. What is the
proposal? lit is not that 'the steamship companies should carry them at reduced rates.
No. The president of the embryo ship company, only a couple of weeks ago, said in
effect to his shareholders: "Hold your stocks.
We have a deal on here that is going to make
your stock worth par. We are going to have
a flow of business here at profitable rates,
and it will make our venture a success." That
is the implication of his words. The Government proposes to turn the business of the
country, as far ase possible, through a particular channel at a rate which is admitted
to be unprofitable to the carrier, and proposes
then to subsidize that carrier out of your
pocket and mine to compensate it for carrying out his part of the programme. What will
be the ultimate result? It wil be, that instead
of the commodity bearing the cost of transportation to its legitima-te market, people who
are in no way concerned in the transportation
of that commodity will be taxed to pay the
subsidy. It does not appear to me to be a
business proposition.
Fuithermore, suppose that the arrangements
were made and steamship companies were
subsidized to carry the entire product of
Canada to foreign markets, and that the
people were taxed to pay the cost. Whaf
would be the effect of that on the coct of
living in Canada? Would it be reduced, as
the Speech indicates will be the resu|t? I say
no; the resu&t would be absolutely and entirely the opposite. The effect would be to

15

make commodities scarce and dear in Canada,
because the people here would be taxed in
order that those commodities might be shipped
away to a foreign market.
The Speech from the Throne indicates that
the Government desires to make some amendment to the British North America Act that
woukl affect the jurisdiction and the powers
of this body. It is proposed to hold a conference to diseuss this question with the
provinces. I am sure that there ought not
to be and probably will not be any objection
to the Government holing any conference
there with the provincial governments or the
municipal authorities if they see fit, and that
we need not waste any time in discussing that
feature.
It is all well enough to stand up here and
criticize the Government and the utterances of
the Government as contained in the Speech
from the Throne; but I wonder whether that
is going to be very useful unless we also
attempt to say a word or two that may be
regarded as of a somewhat constructive nature.
If the picture that I have feebly endeavoured
to lay before you, indicating that there is
great room for doubt as to the prosperity of
the country during the past year, is a true
one, and if, on the other hand, all the evidence
that I have endeavoured to place before you
indicates the true state of affairs, the result
might be depressing. But it ought not to be.
There is no place on the face of the earth that
has the potential possilbilities to compare with
those cf the Dominion of Canada.
My honourable friend from Moncton (Hon.
Mr. Robinson) referred to the development
of hydro-electric power which in years to come
I think Ls undoubtedly going to bring untold
riches out of the earth and will make this
probably one of the richeot countries in the
world. But just for the present our responsibility is to the present generation rather than
to future generations; and what can be done
to overcome falling revenues, to stop the exodus of population and to increase it, and to
increase the traffic on our transportation systems without which they can never succeed?
It seems to me that the experience of those
two great countries, the United States and
France, and the policies that they have followed with such success, might with justice be
carefully considered by Canadian citizens. If
we can accomplish something by following a
domestic policy directed towards the upbuilding of our own country, rather than concerning ourselves so much about the fax corners of
the earth, it seems to me that we shall serve
Canada just as effectively. How can that be
done? I had a letter the other day from the

SENATE

16

mayor of one of our large cities in the province of Quebec with reference to the unemploynient situation. He knew I had been
interested in the subi ect a few years ago as a
Minister of the Crown. 11e indicated that his
city was one in which substantial industries
were located, industries which were heavily
hit by reason of the increase in the British
preference recently granted. The ultimate
result was that 1,300 of those industrial
workers in that city were out of empînyment,
an unprecedented situation, and some 300
families were being supported by the city in
order to keep them alàve. One wonders
wbether or not Canada is under obligation to
look after bier own people first, and to provide
em.ployment for theni, or to so amend the
lariff regulations as to deprive our own people
of a livelihood, and to make employment for
people in other countries. My idea is that
our duty is to our own people flrst, and that
there should not be preferential treatment accorded to any other nation if such treatment
interferes with the riglit of our own Canadian
citizens to earn a decent livelibood.
Then followed the question of transportation, closely interwoven with our publicallyowned transportation system, in particular,

traffie if they are to succeed. There is nobody more concerned in the success of the
National Railways than the people of Canada, unless it be the Canadian Pacific Railxvay itself, whicb is equally interested," and
cf whicb it bais been properly said by the
president of that corporation that the C.P.R.
is the largest taxpayer in the country, and
therefore interested from that standpoint.
W hen we consider that we have in this
vast country only 221 people to each mile
of railway to provide and produce traffic,
,while in the country to the soutb of us there
are 450 people to every railway mile, we must
at once corne to the inevitable conclusion
that the solution of our railway problems and
transportation difficulties lies in an increased
population-a greater number of people to
produce trafflc to be carried over the railwi.ys that we now bave. In this connection
my opinion is that this country, unless special
justification can be shown, ougbt not to build
any further unnecessary railroacis until the
va.st spaces now served by existing lines are
producing traffie.
I feel that I have probably exceeded the
bounds of propriety in speaking at sucb
lengtb, and I beg the indulgence of the bouse.
No doubt fromn time to time during the
present Session opportunities will be given
to discuss each of these subi ects more in deHon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

tail. May I say just a word~ of general import? Perhaps it may be regarded as flot
quite in order, or unusual at this time. For
twenty odd years it bas been my lot to quite
constantly travel over our entûre country,
and, honourable gentlemen, I feel it is a duty
as far as it is reasonably possible for every
man in either House of Parliament to f amiliarize himself between Sessions with the condlitions that obtain in the f ar-away parts of
this country, so that when we meet together
here there may be a better understanding of
and a greater sympatby for the problems of
the other fellow than bas existed in times
gone by. It is difficult for the coal miner
in Nova Scotia to see the side of the employer in the controversy that is now going
on between employer and employed in that
gýreat industry which bas been so seriously
retarded by long-drawn-out disputes. Likewise, the western grain-grower in my opinion
d'oes flot understand the mentality or the
rroblems of tihe eastern city dweller or even
of the eastern farmer. It is true also that
witbout seeing the great western plains and
kncwing something of the ambitions and
problems of the people of the west, it is
quite impossible for a citizen of the east
to fully comprehiend their view. Therefore
I would suggest that as far as possible by
individual effort, or as the Government may
sec fit to encourage it, that it would be usefui in the deliberatiýons uf this House if members were to make themnselves familiar with
the circumstances and surroundiýngs of questions that come before us for consideration.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable gentlemen, 1 join with my bonourable
friend in expressing my appreciation of the
two speches which we heard fromn the honourable gentleman fromn New Brunswick
(Hon. Mr. Robinson) and the honourable
gentleman fromn Quebec (Hon. Mr. Tessier).
They have treated the questions in the
So)eech from the Tbrone wbicb interested
them both fromn a higli plane. The bonoura.ble gentleman fromn New Brunswick brings
to this Chamber an experienced and logical
mind. He is unquestionably an acquisition
to this House. As to my honourable friend
fromn Quebec, bie has been here for such a
long time, and we appreciate bis contributions to the work of this Chamber so much,
that I need not present him. with special
commenclations except, to, reciprocate the
v'ery kind tbings be said of myseîf.
I have not very much t0 complain of in
the presentation of the views of my honourable friend fromn Welland (Hon. Mr. Robertson). Ho is somewhat critical, but not so

FEBRUARY 10, 1925
vioiently critical as to hurt my feelings. He
bas been ini the Government of this country,
and naturally hie knows that action is much
more difficuit than criticism, and as hie waà a
Minister of the Crown until the latter part of
1921, hie realizes what a wrench the world
war gave to the economic conditions of most
cauntries. It is undoubtedly very difficuit ta
readjust world conditions, and we i Canada
are feeling the effeets of the great war, flot
only upon this but upon other countries of
the worid, even those that did flot participate
in that war. Ail were hurt by the cataclysm.
My honourable friend asked wbether we
had made any progress during 1924. 1 believe
conditions are better to-day than tbey were a
year aga. We have had, I will not say a
bountiful crop, but quite a remnunerative crop
in the West, and there has also been a fair
crop in the East, and conditions are Iooking
somewhat brighter.
Towards the close of hie remarks my lioncurable friend said that his policy would be
to attend to the condition of aur own people
and the protection of their interest through a
higher tariff policy. Aithoughlihe did nat
mention that word it is apparent what lie
nieant, because lie lias critîcized the preferences given ta the other parts of the Empire.
At the autset I draw bis attention to the condition which should precede bis panacea, a
condition wbicli I believe ta be essential. My
bonourable friend holds ta the doctrine that
we must give the manufacturer the home
market, and that this market should he protected for him.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: For tlie workman.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I draw bis attention to tlie fact that that market must first
be made valuable ta him, that there muet be
some purcliasing capacity in tlie market, and
that there ie a purcliasing capacity in tbat
market only wlien tlie vast multitude of consumera cailed the farming aommunity la prosperous.

That la wliat has happened througliout thie

to slow down a. littie because our people have
flot the requisite puTcbssing capacity.
I
repeat, the first condition for the prosperityt
of the country la the prosperity of the farming
cammunity. If you have no prosperous farming comnmunity it is futile ta egay you will
build a Chinese wall around the country and
will sec that the community does not purchaïse
elsewhere. The problem is a larger anc than
that, and cannat be soived simply by saying
we will increase the tariff. It lias af.ten been
said that ta increase
the tariff in many
instances increases taxation; s0 that in this
country, with aur great geographicai difficu mties
and conditions, we must think of samething
cIsc than the tariff. It has been my experience
that when there je buoyancy inside the
country, wlien there is prosperity, we very
seldom hear aur friende of the industriai world
camplaining of the toa keen campetition of
foreign goads. The question whidli faces this
country la the question of cheapening transportation and the cost o-f production in order
ta give a larger margin of profit ta the producers. 1 amn apeaking of the producers on
the land, those wbo
produce the greatest
wealtb upon whicb the manufacturers and
athers engaged, in industry must principally
d'epend for the sale of their goods.
~It is unfortumate perhaps that before settling a few millions mare of people in the ,East,.
cmn Provrinces we opened cur West and extended our operations ta the Rockies. Perbaps
it miglit have been better---of course, one is
always wiser after the event-to attcmpt the
development of our Eastern Provinces and the
increasing of our population there before venturing upon that expansion in the Western
Provinces. However, people have settied in
the West and tibey feci that the iow price received for their praduct during the last fcw
years, except last autuxnn, and the higli cait
of production and af transportation, prevent
farming in the West from bcing remunerative.
It je aur imperative duty ta make farniing
in the West profitable. Il we can cheapen
transportation. by rail and by water, we s"al
have done considerable towards salving the
probleni.
My honourable friend (Hlon. Mr. Robertson) spoke of the effort thlat this Government
intends to makre, or la making, to reduce costs
of transporta ipz on the scas. If there in
clearly an autocratie monopoiy an thie sea,

Country as well. My honourable friend says:
"But if you get a lower rate on the seas, it
will be unprofitable and may be at the expense of the community in general." I hope
not. I hope that we may be able to get a
lower rate which will net be unprofitable, and
for which the taxpayers of the country will
not have to pay. Even if they did have to pay
to a certain extent, that should not scandalize
my honourable friend too much because a
statement which I read before the House
opened, frorn a gentleman whom he knows
very well, clothed with an expression of this
opinion, which is perhaps shared by my honourable friend-"that to enable the products
of the Western Provinces to reach more readily
the markets so developed, the special transportation burdens borne by those provinces
should be shared by the whole Dominion,
either by contribution to the long-haul freight
oost, or by assistance in some other form."
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: On land.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: So there is a
willingness on the part of some people to bear
part of the cost of railway transportation. The
principal would be the same if there were
losses on the sea to be shared by all the
people; but all this would be conducive to
reducing the cost of production in those three
Western Provinces; and if, even at the expense of the taxpayers in general, we can do
something to make farming in the West profitable, I think the country at large will agree
to make that sacrifice, because the result will
be prosperity in the East, by reason of the
increased purchasing power created in those
three Provinces.
My honourable friend tas not dwelt at
length on the question of immigration. He
has simply mentioned the fact that we were
quietly extending our operations in Europe,
but he mentioned it in order to affirm that
we were losing that population by emigration
to the south. Of course, there have been
considerable difficulties in starting anew the
procession of immigrants to our shores. All
our activities in that respect-our publicity
and propaganda in Europe-had been stopped
and had not been started again when this
Government came into power. The whole
of the machinery had to be organized and
started in Europe, for the purpose of reaching
prospective immigrants. Then the ocean fare
has increased formidably, and this increase is
a strong deterrant to peeople desiring to cross
the sea and come to Canada. The proposed
attempt to control ocean rates may help in
increasing the number of immigrants coming
to our shores. It must not be forgotten that
Hon. Mr. DANDURND.

the best immigration agent is the satisfiea
settler, and in recent years we have had no
help from those Western farmers who came
from Europe. It is hoped that if they become
more prosperous they will themsedves attract
immigration, through their letters to thei
families and friends. I do not think we shah
be asking Providence for the impossible if
we pray that the coming season may give the
West, and Canada in general-, a good crop.
We are not expecting those wonderful crops
that corne occasionally, but with fairly good
crop and a fairly good price our people in the
West would be set on their feet, and I hope
that the West, as well as the East, may next
summer be blessed with such a crop.
My honourable friend has spoken of emigration. He has mentioned one of the causes
for the departure of some of our people for
the south, namely, that wages have been
considerably increased in the United States,
owing to the fact that the door tas been practically closed to European immigrants, but
left open on the Canadian side. Thus there
has been produced in many centres a certain
shortage of labour, and wages have gone up.
There was a time when the United States
received 500,000 to 1,000,000 men a year, and
two-thirds of the number were distributea
among tte towns and cities, and this helped
to maintain a fair wage scale. My honourable friend, who tas been the champion of
labour, will admit that it is an abnormal
situation that labourers can get a dollar an
hour. That is a reversal of world conditions.
Perhaps the rate is higher.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Two dolllars an hour.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
even two dollars an hour.

I am told it is

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Two dollars a
day on Portage Plains.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: So it is no surprise that sonie of our people have been attracted by those higher wages. My honourable friend, in referring to the number of
people who have crossed over to the United
States, tas been obliged to use American data
gathered at Washington; for a country never
keeps tâb of those who leave it, but takes
account of only those who come in. Many
of our people who cross from the oider
provinces do so with the intention of returning. We have never had in Canada a census
of the people who have come back. In March
last, for the first time, our officers were asked
to keep a record of the number of Canadians
returning who had been in the United States
six months or more, but less than three years,

FEBRUARY 10, 1925
and vunder. this new order it was f ound Vhat
on the average 4,000 a month had returned.
What wouldý have been the record if the order
had gone forth to takze account of the people
who had been hme than oix months in the
United States? I know of hundfreds of people
along the border who, go acroes froan the
Province of Quebec into the State of Maine
or New Hamipshire with the intention of staying three of four months and who do return
to Canada.
I desire to repeat, to this honourabie Chamber a very interesting statement made elsewhere. According to the United States Immigration Department, between the years 1910
and 1920, 742,000 Canadians crossed the border; that is, one-tenth of our then population.
But what does the United States Census Departmnent say? I cited the hImigration Department's record, but the Census Departmnent
of the Republie deolares that in 1920 there
were 78,000 fewer native-born Canadians in
the United States than were recorded in 1910.
In order to, know exactly wlhat ail such figures
as are *mentioned for the current year are
worth, it will be necessary to, await the Census
of 1930, five years hence, and then we may be
surprised to, find that the people who seemed
Vo have gone Vo the United States are not
there. Most of them will have rcturned in
the interval to Canada.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Doce the honourable
gentleman mean that there is no emigration
frosn Canada to the States?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Emigration from
Canada? Oh, there is; but there is emigration f rom the United States as well.
Hon. Mr. TANNERt: Doca my honourable
friend mean us to understand that there is
as much back?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I inean only
to, give these two, figures. The Immigration
Departmnent declares that from. 1910 to 1920
742,000 Canadian-boru crossed over to the
United States as emigrants; but when the
Census was taken it was found that the
native-born Canadians were fewer by 78,000
in 1920 than in 1910.
Hon. MT. TANNER: Does my honourable
friend know that almost anything can be
proven fromn those figures that hie is quoting now; but when you go about the country
and see settiements depopulated and you know
that the people are gone and are not coming
back, you are very apt to lose faith in thee
figures.
Hon. 'Mr. WATSON: They are Soming
back.

19

Hon. Mr. DMNDURAND:
I amn simply
citing those figures for the purpose of affirming with my honourable friend <Hon. Mr.
Tanner) that we muet flot be too, cooksure
about the statisties Vaken frorn either side.
It is ina answer to, my honourable friends tihat
I give these figures, a.s being quite iluminating, if they are explainable.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: We have authorities
like the Premier of Nova Scotia and the late
Provincial Secretary of 'Nova Scotia, who
retired a few weeks ago, and other emînent
gentlemen, who have come up to, Ottawa and
told the honourable gentlemen of the Federal
Governanent, that there is what they call an
alarmning exodus of young people. Premier
Armstrong of Nova Scotia came up here
tweive months ago and informed you that
the fishing districts of Nova Scotia are
depopulated, which is a faoct. They are depopulated-actualýly cleaned out.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 0f course, my
honouirable friend knows why.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: My honourable friiend
tells us that these figures prove that nothing
of the kind happened.
Hon, Mr. DANDURAND:
I do noV eay
that nothing of the kind happened, but my
honourable friend knows very well why the
fisherman of Nova Scotia is attracted Vo, the
other side, and perhaps he might desire to
return to 1911 and wish hie had not voted
against reciprocity at that time.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: What we want is
people, not figures.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I know there
are New Brunswickers also who night and
day are deploring the rejection of reciprocity
in 1911, and I helieve that Nova Scotia
would not to-day refuse reciprocity with the
United States.
Hon. Mr. TESSIER:
But they cannot
get it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Hear, hear. They
cannot get it. That is riglit.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We cannot get
it, but when we could get it it was refused.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
Neyer could
get it.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
There is something in keeping it after you
geV it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 0f course, there
is that to he considered.
My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Robertson)
bas spoken of the unemployment situation as

SENATE
being worse in Canada than in the United
States. I think that is the point my honourable friend made. Well, the Federal Reserve
Bulletin for the month of December gives
the conditions of employment in the United
States for the months of June, July, August,
September and October, and here is what it
says:
The decrease in the United States during June,
July, August, September and October in the employment index

is 12 per cent.

The decrease in Canada

is 6.6 per cent.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I interrupt
my honourable friend for a moment, to point
out to him that if he would refer to the
figures from Januarv to May, inclusive, he
would find an entirely different situation, but
in the third week in May, 1924, a wave of
uncertainty swept over the United States, as
always occurs in that country a few months
prior to an election. My honourable friend
has picked out the months from June to
October. The elections were held on November
4th, and when November 4th was passed the
United States immediately stepped into their
stride again and they have been going at a
lively pace since; for, as my honourable friend
said a few minutes ago, men were in demand
there at high wages.
I read to the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable gentleman the index numbers
regarding employment in manufacturing and
railway operations in Canada and the United
States, based upon the average index numbers
reported by employers in 1923, as 100. My
honourable friend will sec that, according to
this table, conditions were approaching normal
more rapidly in Canada than in the United
States. He says these figures arc for only
part of 1924, but I believe that he would
find also that the conditions for the whole of
1924, as shown by the fluctuation from one
month to an other, do not indicate that
Canada is inferior to the United States in the
matter of employment.
As to failures, I believe that our situation
is much better than that of the United States.
In 1922 there were 3,695 failures, but that
number comprises not only the industrial
world, but all of the commercial and trading
firms of the country. In 1923 there were
3,247 failures; in 1924, 2,474. In 1922 the
liabilities of the large concerns that went
down, 857 in number, amounted to $39,000,000;
in 1923, with 792 such concerns, they amounted
to 331,000,000; in 1924 the number of these
concerns was reduced to 625, with a liability
of $36,000,000.
The third quarter of 1924, according to
Dun's report, broke the record in the United
States for failures.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Might I suggest to my honourable friend that
he is not making the most of his argument.
If be carries it out and goes on from year to
year, he will come to a time when there will
be no failures, because there will be nobody
left to fail.
So my honourHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
able friend says, but I will show him that in
the United States the number has kept increasing, so there were still some left. On
the other hand, in this country the number
was decreasing.
This quotation is from Dun's report:
The month of March, 1924, holds the erontry's record
for the laigest volume of failure liabilities for any
The 1924 total of commercial failures
single nonth.
was 20,615 in number and $514.225,000 in volune of

failure liabilities. This is an increase over 1923 of not
quite 2,000 in number and $1,000,000 in volume. AIthough 1921 and 1922 slightlv exceed 1923-24 in number
and volume of failures, the year 1924 easily holds the
banner over the twenty-five years preceding. It exceeds
by a fairly wide inargin the combined totals for the
years 1919 and 1920, and very largely exceeds the total
of the panic of 1908.

Now, as an indication of the situation in the
United States, let us look at their bank
faîilures. In 1924 there were 613 bank failures,
the largest number in any year during the
present generation. The liabilities anounted
to $202,000,000, a figure which has been exceeded only twice in 25 years. The total
found on page 10 of Dun's review for January
10 is the aumount of the liabilities and the
number of bank suspensions for 22 years, from
1903 to 1924. In 1922 the bank failures in the
United States involved 277 banks and liabilities of $77,000,000, in 1923 there were 578
banks, with liabilities of $203,000,000; in 1924
there were 613 failures, a1ld liabilities of $202,000,000. Tiat country, under a high protective
tariff, seems to have suffered more than Canada.
My honourable friend spoke of the doubtful
condition of our industrial expension. Let us
see what the figures show from 1921 to 1924?
These figures cover exports of Canadian produce under three heads: raw materials, goods
partly nanufactured, and goods fully or
chiefly manufactured. 1921 was an abnormal
year.

So we have gained in the manufactured or
partly manufactured goods; and I think this
indicates quite a helalthy situation so far as
our manufacturing 'industries are concerned.
The excess of manufactured goods imported
over manufactured goods exported in 1921
amounted to, 5264,000,000; in 1922 to $120,000,000; in 1923 to $59,000,000, and in 1924 to
have
$47,000,000. That indicates that .we
gradually been increasing our manufactures to
meet the requirements of our markets. From
this it would seem that manufactured goods
from outside are not displacing our goods to
the extent that we have been led to believe,
but on the contrary that we have been
gradually gaining. This also shows a healthy
condition in Canada.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Less money to buy.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend said that the cost of living had flot
been reduced. Let me give him somne figures
from the Bureau of Statisties. The average
cost of a food budget in 1921 was $12.10; in
1922, $10.29; in 1923, $10.52; in 1924, $10.31.
This is a weekly food budget for a family of
five. The budget, including food, fuel, light
and rent. is as follows: 1921, $22.71; 1922,
$20.88; 1923, 821.07; 1924, $20.80.
This shows a gradual reduction, but I
recognize that conditions are such that it is
very difficult to, bring down the cost of living.
1 have often stated that the wage earners
took advantage of the exceptional conditions
that obtained during the war to boost their
wages. They have been somewhat reluctant
to have them reduced, and the result is that
although they handle more money they themselves must pay a higher cost of living which
they, themselves, largely created. When the
cost of building a house has doubled, it is
logical thýat when the labourer goes to rent
that house he must pay double the rentai he

21

used to, pay. Li1<ewise, in the case of coal and
other commodities, especially those to which
the cost of long-haul transportation must be
added. Wages on the railway, in the mine,
in the forest, although the latter have lately
come down, ail go to enhance the cost of
living, and it is somewhat difficuit to reduce
it so long as wages remain. as they are.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Is it my honourable friend's conclusion that, in order to, reduce
the cost of living wages must first be reduced
in the country?
I have been
lion. Mr. DANDURAND:
stating a fact. It is one of the problems with
which we have to contend, one of the conditions which we have to consider, and my
honourable friend can with very little graoe
speak of the high cost of living when he, perhaps, has been one of those who lias assisted
to increase that cost of living. 1 have known
other people, as well as wage earners, who
have insisted that "what we have we hold".
That is a condition which we will have to
face, and an explanation is due to, the wageearners as well as to the community in general, because the wage-earners must know
that houses cannot be built at an increased
cost because of higlier wages and rented at the
old figure. This stands to reason, and they
must be brought to understand that the
present condition is partly due to the high
wages given them.
At 6 o'clock the Senate took recess.

The Senate resumed at 8 o'clock.
Hlonourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gentlemen, it may be of interest to have ini our
Hansard a statement prepared by the Internal
Trade Branch of our Bureau of Statigtica,
regarding the cost of a food budget compiising
specified articles and quantities mentioned, ini
certain cities in Canada in July, 1924, and
sirmiar information regarding the United States.
The statement covers the cities of Montreal,
Toronto, Windsor, Winnipeg and Vancouver,
and the citie.s of Boston, Buffalo, Chicago,
Detroit, Minneapolis and Seattle. The statement shows the 'totals for Canada and for
the UJnited States.
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD: Wholesale or retail?
Hlon. Mr. DANDURAND: I can give only
what I have beore me. It is evidently the
retail price.

My honourable friend, in referring te the
cost of living, asked us to ýponder over the
situation in France and Great Britain-one a
free-trade country and the other protectionist-and he stated his belief that thse eost of
living was lower in France than in Great
Britain. My conviction is to thse contrary.
I was in France for a fewv weeks last autumn,
and I ovas told that prices had mounted te
suceh an extent that the ilorriot Government
had found it necessary to attempt te fix
maximum prices. In fact, thie franc is worth

only one quarter of its normal value. When
you discuss the question with rosidents, yeu
find' that the cost of living is three times
what it -%vas on the hasis of the franc. So
yen wil soe that the Icost of living there is
quite high; but I doubt thýat there is any
conaparison posible between the normal situation of a country with suds an exceptienal
situation as this.
'My honýourable friend bas suggested two

building. The latter suggestion ms.y reopen
the whole question af the policy which the
Senate foïLlowed lest year. The policy of
rny honourable friend was not f ÔLlowed by
the Senate st year, because it declared the
necessity of building 21 or 22 lines out cf
26 submitted ta us. It was decided by the
Senate then, un the menits of eaoh eaue,
th-at there ie suoh a thing as maniey well
spent even though finances ;are dîfficujit. One
may be in etraitened circuimstances, but at
the same time he may feel that it is a good
thing even for him to, borrow money ta
advance hie own intereets. Sa I say for this
reasan 1 would not be ready ta adhere ta
a hard and fast ruhe that there shculd be
no more money spent for railway branches.
There is, 1 know, a desire on bath sides
in the Senate ta examine closely inta the
problem, of the Peace River region, frorn
which nearly half the people have Whready
maved out because they could not sell the
products of the land. This is a very nich
area, and the question is whether or not having already opened that country we should
do something ta retain the population which
is Vhere and try ta bring -in tens. cf thousands
cf people who would came in if they could
seNl their pToducts and send them ta Vancouver, which I think ie the neareat point
on the seaboard.
My hanourable friend bas said that the
Speech ýfrom the TJarone failed te mention
the work wbich was done at the Fifth

last September. He added that the question
wau one of suicient importance tec merit

the moment bas corne ta maire a statement
on this matter te the Senate. The right
honourable the junior memnber for Ottawa
(Right Han. Sir George E. Foster) has
given a notice of motion which may apen
up the whcle question. AMl that 1 desîre ta
eay le that my honourable friend's statement
that the Canadian delegates adhered ta the
protocol would need qualification. Most af
the representatives cf the nations, the representatives of Canada among them, bad ne

Charles J. Doherty and the Hon. Arthur L.
Sif ton, whoee names wiil go domwn ini history as

I can make the general statement that the
underlying principles of the Protocol will be
found in the Covenant. When we examine
these suggested amendmente we shail have
ta determine whether there is any increased
responsibility ta be assumed by Canada, and
if sa whether Canada should accept them. 1
simply desire at this moment ta convey ta
the minde of my honourable friends the fact
that the Covenant obligates the sîgnatories ta
apply economic sanctions ta an aggressor, ta
give financial, contributions and military aupport.
The Covenant furthermore declares
that the Cauncil of the Society of Nation&I amrn ot using the exact language-wrill

abilities.
Honourable gentlemen will remember that
Article 10 in the Covenant declared that ail

the four first sittings of the Assembly ta free
Canada from that obligation, which the
United States refused to accept, and in the
fourth Assembly in 192 a resolution braught
in by the Canadian delegation would have
been adopted but for the vote cf Persis
which prevented unaniniity in the Assembly.
That amendment was in the form cf an initerpretive clause, which stated that the
obligations flowing from Article 10 would be
limited by the geographic situation of a
country, and that Parliament would be
supreme in deciding the extent of the military

contributions.
In other words, the amendment, which nearly carried, interpreting clause
10, allowed the geographical situation of a
country to enter into consideration and
recognized the supremacy of each Parliament.
This amendment did not carry, but my honcurable friends, when reading the Protocol,
will find that these safeguards are to be found
in it. Of course, it may be found that the
economic and financial sanctions have been
made more stringent towards the adherent to
the Protocol, and the question raised by the
Japanese towards the end of the session may
call for some explanation and discussion.
I will not enter more fully into the details
of the Protocol, but will simply say that these
are amendments
to the Covenant which
already binds us to give the Couneil of the
League of Nations the support of Canada
in the economic, financial, and military fields.
I will await another occasion, perhaps when the
right honourable gentleman's motion comes
up, to lay the documents before the Senate
and to explain the working of the Protocol
under the Covenant.

I regret that the ex-Minister of Labour
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) is not in his seat. The
cost of living cannot very well go down unless wages go down too, and I am sure the
ex-Minister of Labour would be opposed to
wages going down, as my honourable friend
from Winnipeg is opposed to the price of

Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
It has been
demonstrated in this House--and I think the
honourable member from Assiniboja, (Hon.
Mr. Turriff) produced the facts and stated
them once for ali-that there is not a branchline railway in the province of Manitoba or
the province of Saskatchewan that is not a
paying branch. It is on those branch uines
that the freight originates, and everyone
knows that ail these lines are paying. The
trouble is with- the Transcontinental uine,
which ws.s built by the honoured leader of
the honourable gentleman, and all these other
main uines. It is not with the branch lines,
for they originate the freight, f.rom which .the
honourable gentleman and his people in
Quebec are to-day reapîng the benefit -and
upon which they are living, and it is building
up the port of Montreail and the province
of Quebec. Why does the honourable gentleman make such -a statement after 'he has been
eontradicted in this House time and time
again and the facts have been brought down
and it has been proven beyond any question
of doubt that those branch lines of railway
in Saskatchewan and Manitoba have paid
from the very day they were laid down and
the first engine ran over them? The honourable gentleman has made the same statement
time and time again in this House. I wish
the honourable gentleman from Assiniboia
(Hon. Mr. Turriff) were here. He had the
facts bef are him at iast Session, and the
honourable gentleman from De Lanaudière
<Hon. Mr. Caegrain) neye-r dared to contradict them; but now le rises and says the

Quebec is paying for the railways
in Saskatchewan. The province of Quebec is
paying to-day for the city of Montreal1,
which bas reaped the benefit of ail those rates
on freight that is brought there by railways
in which millions of dollars of the money of
the people of Canada have been invested.
Now, let us have an end of that sort of
thing. And 'let me tell the honourable gentlemen this, that-I regret very much to say

made a statement which has not been contradîcted. 1 said that Mr. E. W. Beatty,
before a Committee of the House of Comrc.ons, had declared that ail lines west of the
Great Lakes were bringing in a grass revenue
of about 88,000 a mile, and aIl lies east of
the Great Lakes were bringing in 811,000 a
mile. Now, if on one part of a raîlway yau
ccllect $8,000 andi on another part of that
same railway you collect $11,000 per mile,
and there is a deficit on the whole, where
wiil you look for the deficit? Is it where
you get the most money or where you get the
least money? That is what I would like ta
know. If you are going ta look where the
deficit isHon. Mr. McMEANS: Wiil my honourcbie friend permit me just one word?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Will my honaurable fricnd tell us wherc ta flnd the deficit?
In the province of Quebec we have 500 persans per mile, and in the prairies they have
only 120. We have people ta buy tickets
and! travel and ta provide freight.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Will the honourable gentleman tell me this? The Gcvernnient, of which he is such a very strong
supporter, introduced a Bill last Session ta
build more lines in the WestHan. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is where they
were wrong, and I voted against them.

SENATE

26

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I know, but the
honourable gentleman is supporting the Government that did it. The very Government
he is supporting introduced those bille. This
honourable House rejected some of them,
and the honourable gentleman's own leader
bas instituted a campaign against this honourable body for the reason that we did not
approve of the building of more lines in the
West. Because this Senate had thrown out
two lines of railway the Prime Minister of
this country started an agitation throughout
Canada for the reformation of the Senate.
How can the honourable gentleman reconcile that? He says there are too many lines
of railway in the West. We threw out two
proposed branches because we thought they
should not be built, and the very Government of which the honourable gentleman is
a very servile supporter-and I say it without offence-want to build more lines. Do
be consistent, do be logical, when you make
a statement of that kind.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
The honourable
gentleman has not contradicted the statement
about the $8,000 and the $11,000 gross receipts
per mile. That was the argument, and he
has not yet answered it. Will he contradict
it? I give him a chance to make another
speech and contradict it.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: What is that?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The honourable
gentleman does not speak to the subject
matter. What about the $8,000 and the $11,000
per mile?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
I am sure the
honourable gentleman does not know.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: But what about
the $8,000 and the $11,000 per mile? Does the

Question!

I have not the
Sit down, then.

L'ESPERANCE:

Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
careful, please.

Question!

Now, do be a little

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Well, as I was
saying, in the Province of Quebec we have
500 persons per mile, and the Prairie Provinces
have 120 per mile. Anyway, if railway rates
are decreased and in consequence there is less
money taken by the railroads, what will happen? Somebody will have to make up for
the loss; we must tax somebody. Now, the
point I was trying to make was that in
Quebec you will tax five persons per mile for
every one who is taxed in the Prairie Provinces; or, to be literal, say you will tax four
in Quebec for one in the Prairie Provinces.
So where will the bulk of the money come
frorm to make up for those reductions in
rates? It must be done by taxation. The
money must be found if you reduce one
source of supply, that is, the freight rates.
Everybody knows that the freight is the main
source of revenue from a railway. Out of
every $5 taken in by the Grand Trunk system
there was $4 earned from freight and $1
from passengers. On the C.P.R., for every $4
there was $3 from freight and $1 from passenger service. So freight is the main thing.
Now, if you reduce the freight rate you must
find the money to make up the deficit. I
dlaim that Ontario and Quebec will have to
make it up, because if Saskatchewan pays
other taxes as it pays the income tax, it will
contribute $2 a head, whereas Quebec will
pay $10 and Ontario $9.25. That is the situation. There is no disgrace about it, but that
is the way it appears. So we are paying for
Saskatchewan, and I do not blame that
province if we are willing to let this system
go on.
In Quebec we want some railroada this year,
and we want them very badly. There has
been discovered in Northern Quebec something which is said to be equal to the mines
of Ontario. There are in Northern Quebec
no railroads. Now, there is some talk about
our having railways built there. In the
Quebec Legislature Hon. Mr. Patenaude, at
one time a Cabinet Minister in the Borden
cabinet; said: "We have too many railways;
we do not want any railroads there." The
proposal is to build frorm Mont Laurier up
by Rouyn and those other townships which
are supposed to be full of valuable minerals.

FEBRUARY 10, 1925
Hlon. Mr. MoMEANS: But why dces not
the province of Quebec build it?
Hlon. Mr. CASORAIN: Well, let the province of Quebee build it, and we wouild like
the three Prairie Provinces ta build, the
Hudson Bay Railway at the same time. Tihat
suggestion is quite apropos. The honourable
gentleman is making my speech mudh more
interesting than I thought it was going to be,
in a thin house. The Hudson Bay Railway
has been spoken about in this House for
the last twenty years and more. I remember one honourable gentleman (Sir James
Lougheed)-who, 1 arn sorry ta Say, is
absent through illness-saying, "We have
heard the annual wail of the Prophet
Jeremiah," because I wae against the building
of that railway. I amn begi.nning ta thinýk I
was a good prophet. New it bas turned out
that the provinces themselves are going to
bufld iL.
As to, the ra1lway rates, the question bs a
very simple one. Personally I should think
that those who ship the goods should be the
people to pay adequate freight, so that
others in the country, who do not ship goods,
neeýd not be taxed on that account. That, I
think, is a very siimple proposition, and is
fair. It is the same principle as that of the
ald. toli road, on which everybody who
travelled had to pay toll. If any person wants
to, ship some goods, he ought to -pay the
proper rate. The province of Ontario ia a
littie better off than we in Quebeo are so
far as raiîways are concerned. They have 250
persons per mile of railway; sa, they have
twice as muoh mileage in proportion as
Quebec. I must say, thou-gh, that it is in
the province of Ontario that the biggest
trafflc is to be found; it is around Toronto
that the biggest traffic on rallways is being
done to-day on both the Canadian National
and the C.P.R. The honourable the ExMinister of Labour <Hon. Mr~. Robertson)
knows that it is in the manufacturing and
industrial centres in the province of Ontario
that the most business on the railws.ys is
being done, and not in Québec. But some
people from the West would .92Y tbhat it is
in Ontario, where the business is being done,
that the deficit arises. On the prairies there
are a f ew carloads3 now and then on a branch
line during the greater part of the time, and
it is neceasary ta, keep the rolling stock on
h.and. for tweive months in order that it
may be used for three months at most.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: There are 400,000,000
buehels of wheat.

27

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It is neceesry to,
earn ail the money in two or three months,
whereas the railways in Ontario work twelve
months ein the year. Certain honourable
gentlemen, who have neyer made any study
of this sort of thing, would have this honourable House believe that the deficit wouid
arise where the business is being done, and
the surplus would be where there is no business done during nine moniths aut of twelve.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: 400,000,000 bushels of
wheat.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: There is another
point. The commoddty wheat, they give us
to carry is carried. at very ittie, a-bove cost.
I amn obliged to the honourable member from
Portage La Prairie (Hon. Mr. Watson) for
reminding me of that point. Wheat, is the
cheapest commodity caxried: it is cazri.ed
a'lmost at cost: there, is no money in it. It iE
the qiacket freight that. pays, and it pays three
or four times more than wheat per ton. Yet
it is said that wheat is a great comrnodiity.
Why, years and years ago, when thue C.P.R.
had almost a *monapoly, I was riding home
on one occasion with Sir Thomas Shaughnessy, who was afterwards Lord Shaughnessy,
and was sayîng ta him, "The C.Pà. is making
much money, because there was a big crop
and you have had the car-rying af the wheat,"
he said to me: "The wheat, crop provides
only one-eighth of the earnings of the
C.,P.R." That vwas years ago, when the
C.P.. had a moncqpoly.
We will now -leave the question of railrway
rates and will tal<e up now the matter of
regulating the rates on the mighty acean.
England has a great 'mercantile marine, yet it
bas neyer been ablie ta regulate acean rates,
and there is no .power an earth that. ca=
regulate those rates. They are reguiated every
day just like the ticker on the stock exchange.
If the rates go down one-eighth of a farthing,
that f act is telegraphed the world over. When
a ehip is on the ihigh sens éhere muet be three
elements ta enable it ta. aperate and meet the
competition: first, it must have the cheapest
money in the worLd; second, it must have the
cheapest labour in the warld; and, third, àt
must have the hîghest efficiency.
I said it must have the cheapest money in
the world. Fiveryone knows that when yau
go and buy a ship in England you pay perhaps 25 or 30 per cent cash and are lent the
rest of the money, and there is a mortgage
left on the ship at the very lowest rate of
intere.ýt in the worML.
The ship would be
well insured. The shipyard owns the insurance, and if the ship goes ta the bodtom

SENATE

or any accident happens to it, it is a quick
sae and that is all there is to it-there is no
loss. You cannot beat Englishmen in business.
Therefore the ships of the British mercantile
marine have the cheapest money <i.n the world.
As to labour, what about the Laskars? What
about the Chinese labourers? People who
live on the Pacifie coast see those Chinamen
who come in on the C.P.R. boats and who
eat a handful of rice and a piece of raw fish.
They are paid I do not know what wages.
What do the Laskars get? Go down to any
ocean port that is at all busy and you will
see as many blacks as white men There are
also many Norwegians, and I knew Norwegian sailors who got £6 a month, and were fed
on nothing but corned beef and hardtack, and
were strong and husky. A Norwegian captain
whom I knew well, and who was a welleducated man was getting the large sum of
$40 a month, and was expecting to get $50.
That is the sort of competition you have to
meet on the high seas. Can you regulate
that? But there is this possibility that the
task of regulating rates may have a bad
effect, because it is telegraphed everywhere,
and people are planning where to send their
ships this summer, and if they think there is
going to be, not hostility, but ill-will,'some
control which will prevent the ship charging
all it can possibly get, the owners will simply
say, "We will go to another port." There can
be no doubt about that. There is where the
danger lies.
Are those ships making money? Weli, honourable gentlemen, look at the London Times
and sec the quotations of all the S.S. shares.
Mind you, I amrnmaking this statement here
on my responsibility as a Senator and as one
who lias never deceived this House in 25
years-not intentionally at any rate. If the
Hoiuse has been misled it was because I was
not better informed. Look at the London
Times to-day and you will see what shares
are worth to-day. Compare that with what
they were worth say in 1922, and you will
find that shares that were then worth 45
shillings are now selling for 16 shillings. , I
have it on the authority of men who are well
informed that those shares to-day would not
net fifty cents on the dollar as compared with
the price in 1922.
Now people think they are making too
much money, and they talk about the North
Atlantic Conference, while, I think our own
Canadian Government Merchant Marine was
in it, so I do not see that we can do very
much to control rates; but I assure you there
is one thing we might do in another way.
I am told-I only got the information beHon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

tween 12 and 1 o'clook to-day-that the
United States was actually shipping out of
Montreal more than half the wheat shipped
from that port. I have heard over and over
again about wheat going to Buffalo, and so
on, but I am informed that 55 per cent of
the wheat going out from the port of MontWe never hear
real is American wheat.
about that. If we subsidize boats so as to
bring down rates, the Americans may say:
"Very weîl, we will prevent the export of
wheat except through our own ports." And
that wou¶d be a very great loss to the port
of Montreal.
Would they
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
not be happy to get the lower rates on shipping?
Yes, but if the
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
Government fixes a lower rate through a
subsidy and draws commodities from the
American railroads I am informed that the
United States wiliH simply say to the shippers:
"No, you will have to ship your commodities
by American routes and through American
ports," in the same way that we are trying
to contrd our slhippers for Canadian ports.
There is another very serious question. I
have before me a table containing a Ilist of
vessels built outside of Canada from the beginning of 1922 to the end of 1924. This list
gives the names of the ships, tie dimensions,
the name of the builder, the place where
they were built, the year they were built,
the gross tonnage, and the names of the
owners, and I find that we have bought lately
between 1922 and 1924Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Who?

The people of
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
this country have bought 45 ships that are
shown on this list, and there are some ships
that I know of that have been missed in
this list. There is a memorandum at the
bottom of the page whieh says:
In addition to the other mentioned ships, 10 ships
are now being built in Great Britain for Canadian
coastwise trade and will be ready for commission early
in 1925. The purchase price of the ships mentioned in
this schedule is in excess of $40,000,000.

Here is $40,000,000 of good Canadian
money that left Canada to go and buy ships
in Engfland. I know of one firin, a big firm
that has no less than two shipyards in this
country, that actually had three ships built
this year in England because our yards could
not build them as cheaply. On enquiry I
find British ships come into Canada free of
duty.

FEBRUARY 10, 1925
Wages are a very large part, of ie cost of
a ship, namely, 50 per cent. In England they
pay $11.25 a week ta the men employed
around the ships, and in Canada they pay
322.65, or alinoet twice as much; so, with
that difference ini wages, it la quite evident
that competition couid net go on in the
building of ships. Fancy what would have
happened if these 840,000,000 for shipe were
being spent in this country, as they were
bujît before tihe war when we were building
our own ships. If these shipis had been built
here, that arnount of rooney wo-uld have been
available for wages. In the building of the
ahips alone we wnould have had $2M,000,000
distributed arnong the working m en of this
country, and the production of the iron that
would have gone into those sips, and the
coal that wou.ld have 'heen requdred, would
have given work to our minera. I would
say that 837,000,000 in afll would have gone
to our people in wages in one way or another,
and th-en would have gene back ta the fariner,
because when these men wantc-d their breakfast, where would they have to go? They
would have to go to the fariner. At noon
it would be the saine thing again, and the
same thing at night, *and ultimat-ely the
fariner would have got the benefit of that
money.
What I hope is that this Session the Governinent wiIl make it possible for our shipyards
to do something. I understand that there are
petitions before the Gevernment to that
effect. Surely our shipyards have been idle
long enough. I arn told th-at there are 15
large shipyards in Canada, right, over the
country froin the Atlantic to the Pacific-at
Halifax, St. John, along the St. Lawrence,
at Point Lavis, on the Great Lakes, at Collingwood, and in British Columbia. Surely
sonie policy can be devised by which these
shipyards, which have been idde so long, might
start work again. It would be an excellent
thing not only for the thousands of men who
work in the ship yards, but aise for the farming community. There would be no talk then
of the cost of transportation; the market
would be right there. The farine? could sel
his meat and potatoes righ-t there, and that
would eliminate ta a great extent the oost of
transportation.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Two of the three
ships of this one firma that I have mentioned
are no'w carrying package fireiglit -froin Montreal ta Port Arthur and Fort William, and
the third.vessel, the larger one of the three,
one of the ooal boats which has its own mna-

ship geing about distributing American coal,
a ship in whieh there is net one day of Canadian labour, neither in the coal. la it not turne
that we tried to remedy the situation?,
When yen talk about the coal -and steel
industries of this country, it is reaIly a sad
st-ory. You see the slýips coming froin England laden with coal frein the other aide and
passing right by Cape Breton. Why? I admit
that the coal of Cape Breton is hard ta mine,
but on the other hand, what la the differenoe
in the wages of the men -in England and those
in Cape Breton? There are lonourable gentlemen in this House who know better than
I do what the difference ia. But the fact remains th-at these slips ceming froin England
laden with British coal, whether Welsl anthracite or Scotch anthracite or bituminous coal,
and sa on, and a greater quantity went up the
St. Lawrence river last year than ever before.
And yet we have coal mines that are said ta
ba the very 'best. I see the ex-Miniater of
Labour nodding hia 'head to that.
If the Government could do something by
protecting this coal it would hlp. Forty per
cent is slack coal, and there la practioally, no
protection on slack roal. With the improvemonts that tley have in furnaces, bituminous
slack coal is being used, as well as slaok anthracite, and witl a blower it is sufficient ta
raise stearo, and is nearly as efficient as the
ceaI that cornes froin the United States and
competes witl it.
What is the consequence? Our minera in
Cape Breton and at Springhill are idile hocause we have not enough protection on the
coal, and that is a very serious thing, because
a very large proportion of the population down
there are dependent on the coal1 mines.
W-hen the coal mines are prosperous, the province of Nova ýScotia and even New Brunswick, which la adjoining, enjoy prosperity, and
farin producta are sent in to feed the men who
take thle coal out of the maines. I sincerely
hope the Government will be able ta do sarnething this Session ta relievo the iran and steel
induýstries and the coal industry of Cape
Breton.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: For the purpose
of information may I ask the honourable gentleman a queation? I think it is probably true
that the Englial mainer, because of very steadY
employment, las earned as mucl as the miner
in Cape Breton, but is Ilt not correct to Bay
that because a large proportion of ocean-borne
traffic is eastbound, that coal cornes from

30

SENATE

Wales to Canada as ballast, and because there
is no protection the foreign coal is coming in
here? Aiso, will not the same appeal that my
honourable friend makes for slack coal apply
to all grades mined in that territory?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The honourable
gentleman is perfectly right. Very often boats
do come out with coal ballast, and they are
glad to take it too. I have seen wheat used
as ballast. I have seen Allan liners leaving
Montreal carrying wheat as ballast, and they
have gone to Liverpool and have come back
carrying the same wheat. But the fact remains
that it is a great pity. If the Government
could do its share, and the miners could do
their share, it would help the situation. It is
time we got together. They would get steady
employment and at the end of the 365 days
they would have more money than they now
get working spasmodically. At present no
coal company in Cape Breton can work all
through the winter stacking coal, as they call
it--piling it up-because it has to be moved
once more when it has to be shipped. So,
during the winter time work is slack because
there is no money in it.
With regard to the steel industry, which
uses lots of coal, what is the situation? Belgian
rods are coming into St. John, N.B., cheaper
than they can be made here. When rods
were made in Cape Breton it took nearly four
tons of coal to make a ton of steel, and now
that industry is gone too, and the Maritime
Provinces are suffering very much. I take
this opportunity of expressing the wish that
during the present Session something may be
donc to relieve that most difficult situation.
Now, as to the ships on the Great Lakesand I am sorry the honourable gentleman
from Simcoe (lon. Mr. Bennett) is not here
-- it is not a very pleasant outlook either.
People who have paid one hundred cents on
the dollar for their stocks have not been getting any dividends for the past four years.
This is surely not because these ships are
making too much money. Honourable members of this House should understand very
well by now that carrying in Canadian bottoms
on the Great Lakes is not very profitable. In
May, and perhaps for the first week in June,
these ships are employed in taking down all
the wheat that was left over from the previous
fall. It does not take very long to carry that
wheat down. At the end of May, or by the
second week in June, the wheat is all down,
and what are those ships to do all summer?
Our ships are not allowed to go to American
ports, to the Mississaba range, for instance,
and load up; nevertheless, in the fall of the
year our Government sometimes suspends the
coasting laws and allows the American ships
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

to do what our Canadian vessels are not supposed to do. Only two years ago that was
done, and such a congestion was created that
the Canadian boats lost a trip.
That is a pretty blue picture. Let us Iook
at the other side of the medal now. That conditions in this country are very much better,
there is no doubt. We have witnesses to that
in two of our greater institutions, who say
they have had the very best year they have
ever had. If you read the annual review of
the Montreal Herald, you will find letters
from secretaries of boards of trade and chambers of commerce, and mayors of various
towns, who all agree and write letters speaking of the progress made during 1924. These
people never saw each other and could not
possibly have conspired together to make false
reports. There are letters from British Columbia and from the Maritime Provinces, and
there are letters from central Canada. They
all say that the year 1924 was the best they
have ever had, and they name the improvements that have been made in their particular
localities during that time. So things are
getting better in the country, and if the few
suggestions that I make just now are heard
by the Government I think things will be
infinitely better.
But there is one question that is paramount,
the most serious question that has ever engaged
the attention of the Parliament of Canada,
and it has to do with what is taking place
every day of the year. I am referring to
the diversion of water by the Sanitary District of Chicago. That diversion means that
our birthright has been interfered with, that
the St. Lawrence river has actually been
depleted-that the navigable capacity of the
Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence river. and
of the port of Montreal, is being impaired by
a mighty foreign power in order in the first
place to provide sewage facilities to the city
of Chicago, and eventually to empty the water
into the Mississippi river. When I learned
that there was a case before the Supreme
Court of the United States in regard to this
question, I thought that the United States
would argue against the Sanitary District of
Chicago.
I have before me a brief of the
case in the Supreme Court of the United
States, October term, 1924.
It is the
Sanitary District of Chicago, Appellant,
against the United States of America,
Appellee.
This document that I have in my
hand is the brief of the argument of the
appellant.
Here I have the brief of the
appellee, the United States of America. You
can see from the way in which the book is
worn that I have gone through it many a time.
In it you will find that Harlan F. Stone,

FEB.RUJARY
Attorney General of the United States, says
that the diversion is illegal. He says that
for 319 pages, and ýthere are 321 pages in the
book.
He spoils his argument i the last
two pages. This is a very intaraeting case.
I spoke in the Senate about it flfteen or sixVeen years ago.
It started away back more
than a century ago.
The idea, of taking
water from Lake Michigan and the first legislation in the United
States ragarding it
originated in 1822; and i 1827-I suppose
the State of Illinois was not established thenthe United States actually authorizad a canal
of unlimitad width and undeflned depth, with
90 f cet on each side of the canal, to taka
water from Lake Michigan te, the Illinois
river.
It was in 1845 that the works were
started, and this canal has been built. Now
we have the word of the Attorney General of
the United States, who says that tan times
more watar is beixig usad to-day than is
necessary for navigation purposas.
The story of this case is a long one. The
case was hefore the Court for sixtean years.
It first went before Judge Landis, who, I
amn told, is very well known and is now the
authority governing the basebaîl teama in the
United States.

United States, in Washington. fiera is the

think that in Canada, as throughout the
BritisËi Empire, a treaty is a treaty and flot
a scrap of paper, and we must live up to it.
But wby should we agree to more than 250,000
cubie feet per minute? That is the question.
In tbe judgment rendered by the Supreme
Court of the United States last month it was
declared, "You shaîl flot take more than that
quantity," but they said it would be permissible for the Secretary of War to issue a
permit, and yeeterday we received the news
that the permit had been issued for more
than twice the amount stipulated in the treaty.
The rights of Canada are ignored. No notice
whatever is taken of them. It is just as if
the United States bad absolute control over
the whole matter.
The quantity that is now being taken,
600,000 cubic feet per minute, is equal to
10,000 cubie feet per second. May I make
a comparison in order that this honourable
Huse may have somne appreciation of the
quantity of water that is being diverted? Take
a lake 31 miles square. It would lower that
lake every day one foot. In Chicago, which
bas 3.000,000 of a population, there is used in
one day, for sanitary and domnestie purposes,
as much water as tbe city of Moatreal, with
one-third of the population, uses in one year.
They tell us it is for sanitary purposes. We
know Lake Abitibi. It is a great lake, 350
square miles. Well, if the daily supply were
shut off, Lake Abitibi would be empticd by
that canal ini 66 days.
Tbe St. Maurice is a good-sized river. The
regulated flow of the St. Maurice is 10,000
cubic feet per second; that is, with the improvements of the Gouin Dam. Under the
régime of Sir Lomer Gouin there was built
at the head-waters of the St. Maurice River
a huge dam. It actually doubles the quantity
of the flow of the St. Maurice, because the
water is husbanded in the spring of the year
and is paid out during- the summer. Tbe
amount of water taken, the regulated flow,
is 12,000 cubic feet per second, but the natural
flow of the St. Maurice was only one-half of
that. Now there is being taken in the Chicago
Drainage Canal nearly twice as much water
as the natural flow of tbe St. Maurice River.
The Saguenay is a mnighty river, emptying
eut of Lake St. John. The minimum flow,
before the improvements were made there,
wvas just a little more than tbey are diverting
at Chicago. The Chicago Canal is drawing
just onc-sixth less water than the who]e
Saguenay River. The great Cbippewa power
sebeme, under the OJntario ilydro-Electrie
Commission, will develop eventually between
500,000 and 600,000 horse-power. That is
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

using very littie more water than the Sanitary
District of'Chicago is using. It is using more,
but very littie more.
Mr. Harlan F. Stone, the Attorney General
of the United States, says they are using ten
times more water than is necessary for
navigation purposes. They are using ten
tirnes more water than the Lachine Canal.
You ail see the Ottawa River here. The
normal flow of the Ottawa-it is regulated
now, but I refer to the natural flow-is 15,200
feet per second, and to-day the Chicago Sanitary District are using 12,000 feet; for, now
that there bas been this quarrel, they are
using stili more.
I may say that out of this canal, which is
about 28 miles long, at a place called Lockport, just four or five miles north of the town
of Joliette, they are now developing 36,000
horse-power on a drop of 34 feet. If that
were going over Niagara Falls and coming
down to Montreal, you could multiply that
by ten and then you would have about the
amount of horse-power that could be developed with that same amount of water.
What bas been the effeet on our lakes? It
bas bad the effeet of lowering the level of al
the lakes except Lake Superior by one-haîf a
foot. That means that an ordinary lake
freighter loses on every load about 400 tons,
or 13,200 bushels of wheat, that be cannot
carry; and, as tbey calculate that there are
about twenty trips a year, every one of our
vessels loses one full trip during the year.
The Amnerican Sbipping Federation-and they
say it tbemselves-lose by that lowering of
the lakes, at the lowest possible estimate,
$1,000,000 a year.
Now, the Canadian Sbipping Federation
have filed their dlaim with the Secretary of
War in the United States. The Canadian
Shipping Federation say that above Montreal
tbiere is a loss to Canadian shipping by the
lowering of the water of $273,093. Remember,
these figures are found in the briefs of the
United States tbemselves. And below Montreal there is a loss of $ý322,675. Mark you,
bonourable gentlemen, at Montreal they have
reduced the level of tbe water by ten and a
quarter inches. You see what an immense
quantity of additional freight can be carried
by sinking one of those big ocean steamers
ten inches more. They are losing that. Adding these figures together, you find that there
is $595,768 damage done to Canadian shipping
annually by the action of the Chicago Sanitary Canal.
Now, -tbink of the untold mililions that were
spent in dredgiflg the channel to bring it down

Foderal G-overnment of the United States may

tbis Housc wbo bad the courage ta get up
and say what ho tbought. That was the late
W. C. Edwards, wha said the Goorgian Bay
canal was no good. Everybody frowned on
him and thought ho was a kicker, but as a
matter of fact he was the anc wbo was right.
1 was one of the guilty ones; 1 made long
speeches in favour of the canal right in this
bouse. I tbink the bonourablo member from
Mille les (Hon. Mr. David) wiil remember
that in the name af a friend ai bis lie asked
me ta start a discussion in tbis Chamber, and
I did; and I devoted hours of study ta the
question, and 1 tbink I made as good a speech
as any of the others. But 1 admit to-day
that tbe information tbat we had was not as
good as I think it shauld have been, because
large slips cannot be ecanomnically apcrated
in these restricted cbannels. Therefore, if
the Georgian Bay canal lad been built, the
slips, as Senator Edwards said, wouid take
less time in going around than in going
thraugh tbe canal.
In the United States tbey bave had the
same thing. They bave been talking, and in
1907 Mr. bill said that the business of the
United States had incrcased tenfold while
thc railways had increased only about two
or th-reefald; tborefore the railways could no0
longer do the business, and tbat the only
thing was ta bave a canal from tbe lakes ta

deptb of 20 foot, so that ocean slips could

and made a speech about this canal. But

Mississippi from Keokuk to Memphis, and
never before was there such a celebration.
The shores of the river were lined with
people, the sirens shrieked all night, and
whistles were blowing, bands playing, and
people cheering.
But he went back to
Washington and seemed to have forgotten all
about it.
Two years after that Mr. Taft came along.
I am saying this because of the talk about a
St. Lawrence ship canal. Mr. Taft floated
down the Mississippi river, and there was
a great convention, with 5,000 people present.
They were going to have a canal then. That
was in 1909, and they have not put a spade
to it yet. I do not suppose they will ever
put a spade to the St. Lawrence ship canal
either.
After what we have seen of the action of
oux friends on the other side of the line,
we ought to be pretty chary about going into
partnership with them in making a ship canal
down the St. Lawrence from Lake Ontario.
As I say, we should be chary when to-day,
after the judgment of the Supreme Court,
the iSecretary of War issues a permit giving
the Sanitary District 5 years during which
they can take twice the amount of water
stipulated in the treaty. What chance would
we have with them? None whatever. Canada
tas protested, but protested in vain. We
have never been able to get any satisfaction.
They have kept right on taking the water
that did not belong ta them, and we have
not been able to stop them.
Some people say: "You belong to the
League of Nations: why do you not go to
them and get some value for the $500 a day
you are paying?" Now, do you think the
United States would mind the League of
Nations very much? The League of Nations
is all right: it is a fine institution,
made for angels, not for men.
However,
they say the League of Nations could
settle all these little difficulties.
But
I have not very much confidence in that,
because I do not know how many who go
to the League of Nations are sincere. I believe that visionary iluminati statesman who
used to be the Right Honourable Sir Robert
Cecil may be sincere, but still te seems to
stultify himself when he says that if the
articles of the League of Nations are not
followed, then Europe ceases to exist. They
have not been followed very oiten, and
Europe still exists. He stuliifies himself
when he is in favour of the Singapore base,
where the greatest fortress that the world
bas ever seen is going to be erected. If
there is going to be no war, what is the

use of that? Can Australia be sincere,
breathing the invigorating air oi the shores
ai Lake Leman, and sipping the sparkling
wines of France and observing that wonderful institution called the "frais de representation" in action-and then ask for the
Singapore fortress. What about New Zealand?
It is in exactly the sane position. What
about France, with the biggest army she ever
had? And what about England, with her
soldiers in Cologne, and building the biggest
battleships that ever were. Look at the
Renown. The world never saw anything
like that ship that came around the world
advertising Great Britain's navy. Does that
look like peace? No, I do not think we can
get any help from the League of Nations.
They will get our $500 a day, of which $200
goes every day to that notorious socialist
Albert Thomas, to keep up socialism throughout the world.
No, we have only one place where we
can go for help, and that is the foot of the
Throne. We are fortunate enough to be
members of a great empire, the biggest the
world bas ever known-an empire covering
one-quarter of the surface of the globe,
17,000,000 square miles since the war and
15,000,000 before; an empire consisting of
one-quarter of the human race, and all under
the rule of our King George. That is where
even the humblest subject can bring his
grievance. Surely the prayer of a people
nine millions strong stould be teard. I
believe that if we apply to England we can
get redress. The United States are doing
what they themselves say is illegal in impairing the navigable capacity of the St.
Lawrence and of the Great Lakes for the
benefit of a route from the lakes to the Gulf
of Mexico. I say that if we apply to lis
Majesty the King we will be heard, and that
Canada would get if not ail ter rights-because we signed away part of our birthright
-at least the balance of them. Surely we
have made enough sacrifices. There are men
in this Chamber and in another place who
lost their sons-in the war; others have been
prisoners in Germany, men who wish they
had been killed on the battlefield.
I am not ashamed to own that I am an
Imperialist, always have been, and hope
always to be. I believe in the unity of the
Empire. I do not believe in the dismemberment of the Empire into small nations
masquerading as sovereigns states at the League
of Nations at Geneva. I believe we should be
protected, and there is only one place to get
that protection-the foot of the Throne.
It
is only the strong and mighty arm of England

FEBIRUARY 10, 192
that can give us that protection, and England
is aware of it. The Colonial Secretary, the
Right Honourable Colonel Amery, ie aware of
ail this.
I took good care that a certain
paper should be sent to him regularly. He
was informed that our damage bill amounting
to 859,768 per year should, be sent to the
Britishi Ambassador at Washington-the real
Ambassador at Washington-asking
him to
colleet the money for it.
If he failed to
collect the money, if there was any talk about
reparations, then there ie -the Riglit Honourable Winston Churchjill, who as Chancellor
of the Exchequer, pays I think £55,000,000 a
year to the United States.
We will say to
him: "Before you pay that money over,
remember that there are subi ects of Ris
Mai esty wlio are being despoiled of their
rights in Canada. Keep that *money back;
hand it over to Ottawa; we need it hen' and

The Speech from the Throne js a very
remarkable one, -remarkable for what it does
not say. It jsapparent to every member cf
this House, as it is te every citizen of
Canada, that this country je languishing, that
it isin great distress, that our industries are
in peril, that the farmers of the West are
suffering from heavy freight rates. There ie
nothing in the Speech from the Throne that
proposes the slightest degree of amelioration.
The people have asked for bread; the Government bas given them a atone. Even in the
lest speech of the Prime Minister made in

road called the Transcontinental, all the way
across the northern part of the country, where
there was not a town or village in which
freight could origihate.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That has nothing
to do with the country west of Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Surely the honourable gentleman is not so devoid of ordinary
intelligence as to think that in a fertile country where it costs very little to lay down rails
and very little for grading, because there is
no rock cutting or work of that kind to be
done, it is unprofitable to build a railway.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Can the honourable gentleman tell me what the Grand Trunk
Pacifie cost this country?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I cannot tell. I
have not the figures.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I will tell the honourable gentleman. The Grand Trunk Pacific
cost over $50,000 a mile from Winnipeg to
Edmonton; and the Transcontinental does
not go west of Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I am not surprised
at that figure. But under whose auspices was
the Grand Trunk Pacifie built? And where
was the honourable gentleman when it was
being built?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Right here.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: He was there supporting it. It does not cost anything so far
as the Prairie Provinces are concerned. It
is in those provinces that the crop is produced. I remember the time when the wheat
lay rotting at the sidings because there were
no cars to draw it out. If the honourable gentieman persists in the attitude he has taken
towards the West, let me tell him this, that
the people of the West are quite independent;
they could ship their grain by another route
than that which crosses the north shore of
Lake Superior, and they could avoid the port
of Montreal if they wished to do so.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: They are building
an elevator in Buffalo to avoid it now.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: That may be, but
I would like the honourable gentleman to understand that the wild, unauthorized statements
he is making in this House are doing a great
deal of harm, a great deal more harm than he
thinks. The pioneers living out on the
prairies are trying to develop this country in
spite of difficulties of which the honourable
gentleman has no idea, and they are paying
exorbitant freight rates in order to ship their
product through Canada, and yet the honour-

37

able gentleman has the hardihood to state that
Quebec and Ontario are paying for the Western
provinces. The thing is ridiculous and abnurd, and I am surprised that the honourable
gentleman can make such a statement. I
am sure that no other member of this honcurable House would undertake to do so.
The honourable gentleman is condemning
the (ovcrnment of the day on the question of
freight rates. I will not venture an opinion on
tiat. Perhaps the Government are quite
right. If they can do anything that will force
down the ocean rates, I for one will give them
my support, because I think that in that respect there is an opportunity to provide some
relief for the people of Canada. That is the
only thing in the Speech from the Thro.e that
cifers any prospect at all for relief for the
people of this country. The industries are
stifled. The farmers of the West are groaning
under the heavy burden of excessive freight
raton, and 'at the same time my honourable
friend desires that they should not be reduced.
The honourable gentleman occupies a seat on
the Goverrment side of the House, and we
read in the newspapers of the honourable gentleman making speeches throughout the couintry in defence of the Government. In fact.
he declares that they are the best Covernment
in the country.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The best in comparison with the others.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: He is telling the
people of this country what a splendid Government they are. If you pick up the Montreal or Toronto papers you will read that the
bonourable gentleman has made a speech
along those lines.
Hon. Mr. LAIiRD: It is the
Herald that says that.

Montreal

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: But when he rises in
this House the first thing he does is ta condemn everything that the Government have
done, and he condemns them to-day on the
question of freight rates. The Government
are to-day reconsidering the Crow's Nest
rates, and there is no doubt that if they desire
ta remain in power they will cancel the decision made by the Railway Commission. They
have already thrown out a sop to the Progressives. Although the honourable gentleman
applauds the Government when he goes out
through the country, yet when he rises in this
House he condemns them in every possible
way.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: The honourable
gentleman ought to be consistent.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. CAiSGRAIN: Read my speech tomorrow and you wjll see that there iS no0 condemnation.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Then let us hear no0
more talk about those branch lines.
Hlon. Mr.,CASGRAIN: You have too many
lines there. How many people have you per
mile of railway in Manitoba? The honourable gentleman hias asked me a number of
questions, which I have answered. Perbaps he
will allow me to'ask that one.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I cannot tell the
lionourable gentleman.
ýHon. Mr. CASO-RAIN: And the honourable
gentleman taiks on the railway situation!
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: And I want to mention aniother point. The honourable gentleman bhas been condemning brandi lines.

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Voted against tliem

which lie applauds so much throughout the
country lias instituted a cam.paign again,3t
this honou-rable body becauze certain branch
lunes were not approvecd. Hlow does the
honourable gentlemnan reconcile his position
on the other side of the House with the statement whici lie lias made here to-night? He
knows that the Prime Minister of this country
announced la-t year that he was going to
reformi the Sonate because it rejected certain
branch lines which the honourable gentleman
voted against. A telegrain came from the
Goveroýment of Saskatchewan saying, "You
must abol.sh the Senate."
Hon. Mr, CASGRAIN: Sir Wilfrid was to
reformn the Senate too.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Whule it was Conservativo, not while it wa.s liberal. Did not
the honourable gentleman say that if a Bill
lias been passed three times in the House oi
Commons; it should become law?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I did, and I stick
to, that.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Does the honourable gentleman know, in bis experience as a
publie man, of any case in which a Bill passed
by :the Ilouze of Commons tliree times was
rejeoted by the Sonate?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Still the lionouralile

the lionourable gentleman' would only make
tlie sanie sort of speech on Vie liustings as
lie lias mnade in Vhis House to-night, in condemination of the Govemnment lie wo-ild confer
a great benefit. 0f course, we cannot attach

1 believe that in wiat he states in Vhs House

noV see iow the lionourable gentleman couild

The honourable gentleman lias spoken about
steel roda and all that sort of thing, and lie
lias shown tlie difficulties the country is in
because tlie tariff lias been taken off, but lie
'uggests no rcmedy whatsoever. Here you
have a Government like an owl in Vie desert

THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday coneideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening of the Session and the motion of Hon. Mr. Robinson
for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. J. D. TAYLOR: Honourable gentlemen, we have had a full quota of deserved
compliments to the mnover and the seconder
of this Address from the leaders of this House,
and I tbink it would be superfluous for me
as one of the rank and file to attempt to add
anything to it.
I would like to be permitted to say this
to the honourable gentleman from De Lanaudière (Han. Mr. Casgrain), who so greatly
interested us last night, that in my humble
opinion hie contributed far more to the importance of this Address than anything which
we find in the Speech fromn the Throne.
I notice that the Speech at the outset takes
stock of the improved ecanamic conditions
in the world since last prorogation; but,' having ventured so far, the authors of this document very modestly refrain from taking much
credit to themselves.' They put in the f orefront the record of substantial progress in
1924 because the excess value of exparts over
imports was more than $262,000,000. Modesty
again prevents analysis of the nature of these
exports, in which there bulk most largely the
raw materials of this country sent out without let or hindrance on the part of this
Government, in the full knowledge that, as
these raw materials go acrosa the line inta

39

th-e United States, a large proportion of the
industrial population of Canada follows in
that direction.
It seems ta me that the honourable gentlemen responsible for this Speech have been
suiffering from auto-intoxication induced by
indulgence in those fantastia figures from the
Council Chamber with whiéh we have been
entertained here and with which the publie
have been entertained in another place. We
are told that the problem of the cost of living is the mast important before the Govcrnment to-day-a declaration in which I
most heartily agree, and which. has a great
deal to do with the exparts from Canada ta
which I have just referred. While a few
lines later we are told that the trouble with
Canada is that we are still suifering from
the abnormal cost of the war, there is na
reference to, and apparently no calculation
of, the fact that Canadians and Canadian industry particularly are being taxec? at present
the full cost ta us of the war; that ini the
so-called war taxes we are paying every cent
of aur present day contribution ta the result
of that war, and if industry and the public
service languish to-day it is nat because the
public service lacks revenue from ordinary
sources for ardinary administration, since, as
1 say, we are collecting in special taxation
the whole cost of the war ta us.
More than that, while the peaple of the
United States, aur neighbaur and' industrial
competitor, have been relieved in large measure
of the cost of the war and have been enabled
ta return ta normal conditions in business,
we have utterly failed ta adjust conditions
in Canada ta those of aur neighbaurs. Take,
for instance, the income tax in Canada, a
tax pressing with especial severity upan industry of alI kinds. We flnd it mare than
100 per cent-several hundred per cent in
the higher grades-higher than that of the
United States. It is only a few years since,
in answer ta the suggestion coming from the
Opposition of that day, that Canada should
make hier income tax larger, in arder ta tax
the profiteers in this country, we were tald
that if we made a variatian in the incame
tax between this country and' the United
States unfavourable ta Canada, the result
would be ta drive industry, and the income
resulting, across the border.
I think that
argument was perfectly correct then, and it
is just as correct to-day, and the fact of aur
keeping up aur income tax ta a figure mare
than 100 per cent-severaýl hundred per cent
in many cases--higber than that af the United
States, is contributing very largely ta d!riving industry across the Canadian border.

SENATE
Take also the addition to our postal rates
imposed during the war as a war measure,
making the postal rates in Canada from 50 to
100 per cent higher on all classes of business
than the rates in the United States. Does anyone think for a moment that the condition of
our postal rates has not a most important
bearing on the shifting of industry from a
border town in Canada just across the line
to a border town in the United States? And
so on with other taxation, such as the sales
tax. Without going into the details of that,
I would like to refer in a general way to
the fact that the Government themselves contribute in the most oppressive form to the
high cost of living in Canada, and that there
results a depression of industry through maintaining these taxes after the United States
has removed a large portion cf the income tax
and the postal tax.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Will the honourable gentleman tell us in the course of his
remaris by what other revenue he would replace those imposts?
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: I think, honourable
gentlemen, that is a very large question to
ask of a private member of this House. I
would look to the honourable gentlemen
charged with the administration of the Government te give me a lead in that respect, and
particularly would I look for that lead as a
mendier of the Senate, knowing that as a
member of this House I have no responsibility
and an net permitted to share in the substitution of one tax for another. My sole privilege is te raise my voice in protest, as I raise
it at this moment.
We have a large section of this Speech from
the Throne devoted te matters afloat, suggesting a half-seas-over condition, if I may
use the expression, on the part of the Ministry. Feeling impotent te deal with matters
in Canada, they are extending their operations
over the high seas and propose to encourage
the people of Canada to lift themselves by
their boot straps away 'from the oppression of
ocean rates. We are told that we shall receive particulars of this later on. I for one
look fon those particulars with a great deal
of curiosity. As I have read in the press and
gathered from statements made by members
of the Government who have referred to the
press statements, the Government have come
te the conclusion that ocean rates are too
high for the trade of Canada to bear; this
notwithstanding that the Government a.re
themselves proprietors of a large share of the
tonnage engaged in carrying the ocean traffic,
and, so far as I know, as proprietors of this
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR.

tonnage they have not given to the public
any indication that they are carrying at any
lower rates than those imposed by the North
Atlantic Conference, or by any other aggregatien of shipping mon, whether on the Atlantic
or the Pacifie. But they come forvard now
with the comforting proposal that they will
get ton ships and fight the shipping of the
whole world with the operation of those ten
vessels-and fight it how? Net by promising
a reduction in the cost of ocean carriage, but
by promising, as I see it, that they will pay
out of the national exchequer about 25 per
cent of the cost of that tonnage, and that the
favoured line of steamships with which they
are making arrangements will carry the tonnage at the same price as it is carried by
other ships te-day, but that the traffie will be
asked for three-quarters and this Government
will be asked for the other quarter. When I
see this scheme developed, I think it is in
osery way worthy of its author and his long
record in promoting fantastic enterprises for
this Government, from its successive posts in

England and in Europe.
I come now to the paragraph that really
caused me to take part in this debate. It
reads as follows:
Yeu will be asked to sanction the calling of a
conference between the Feleral ani Provincial Governments to consider the advisabilitv of aimending the
British North America Act with respect to constitution
and powers of the Senate and in other important
particulars.

Surely that is a very lame and impotent
concli4on to the threatenings of the past year
conference itvh the Provinces to advise
-a
the Coveirnnment what is to be done about the
Senate. I wonder if that is the most important matter at is ue between this Government
and the Provinces. It seems to me I have
heard something about the natural resources
of Manitoba, Alborta and Saskatchewan. I
have net yet heard that there is any settlement of that. I wonder if that is one of the
other important subjects referred to here to
be deailt with by this conference of the
Provinces and the Dominion, as well as the
question of the Senate. I have heard of very
important questions in discussion between the
Government of British Columbia and this
Government-questions relating to the resteratien of our railway belt to us, in consideration
of events into which I need not enter in
detail now, in connection with fishery matters,
in connection with the taking away from us
of all our profits in the seal industry, and in
innumerable other instances. Surely these matters have bulked more largely in the consideration of the Government than the problem of what to do with the Senate. I have

FEBRUARY 11, 1925
read in the press that Nova Scotia is in a
ferment because of the lack of action on the
part of this Government with respect to the
interests of that province. Similarly with the
province of New Brunswick and the inaction
of this Government in the matter of making
proper use of our winter port at St. John,
instead of continuing to route Canadian traffic
via ports in a foreign country. Surely all
these subjects are more worthy of the attention of any conference between the Provinces
and this Dominion than is the subject put in
the forefront, that is, the action of this
Senate. To what conclusion must one come
when he finds the Senate featured in this
way? The Senate, being the only check or
brake upon the House of Commons,-I was
going to say, the impotent House of Commons, but naturally I do not wish to discuss
the House of Commons here, for it would not
be proper to do so.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
gentleman might limit himself to the Executive.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Yes. I thank the
honourable gentleman for the suggestionthe executive, as representing the House of
Commons. We find, then, the most impotent
Executive in history putting forward the
proposition that the only check or brake upon
the freaks and foolishness of the elective
chamber should be set aside and that they
shoulil be gifted with the attributes of omnipotence to grace their impotence. It seems
to me that this is simply drawing a red herring across the political trail of this Administration by making the age-old complaint of
there being something the matter with the
Senate. For myself I feel quite fit and
healthy. I do not know that there is anything the matter with this part of the Senate.
But I have heard a great deal in British
Columbia during the recent recess about what
the Prime ýMinister then supposed was principally the matter with the Senate. The Prime
Minister came out to Britidh Columbia tewards the end of October. He was breathing slaughterings againet the Senate all the
way across. On the prairies he was eloquent
upon the disappearance, in the course of passage through this House, of certain branch
line bills-Bills which it now turns out were
entirely unnecessary, because the roads have
been provided by private enterprise without
cost to this country, since the Senate halted
the programme last year.
Then he came out te British Columbia. Of
course, we have troubles of our own there,
and we are net wasting any time in regrets
about branch lines in Saskatchewan. The

41

people of Saskatchewan are fully capable
of voicing their own regrets in that particular
But British Columbia must have a share in
the Prime Minister's programme of complaints
against the Senate; so the right honourable
gentleman featured in that province-what
do you suppose? Now, we did not do anything to British Columbia at the last Session
of the Senate. I thought the Senate Committee dealt very squarely with the projects presented with reference to that Province.
Liberally?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
i
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Yes, liberally.
quite appreciate the liberality of the Senate,
seeing the mood in which the Senate was at
the moment, that their sinister mood was
I
net exercised towards British Columbia.
well remember the closing session of that
Committee, if I may be permitted to refer
te it in this way, although it was net officially
reported te this House. We came te the
last Bill on the programme. The honourable
gentleman who sits opposite me (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand), in his capacity of representative
cf the Government there, said te the Gencral
Counsel of the Canadian National, who was
sitting beside him and had been in close conference with him: "Now we have only one
more Bill on this programme; that is, the
Kamloops-Kelowna Branch Line Bill; what
have yeu to say about that, Mr. Rue!?" I
speak from memory, and I hope te
speak correctly. Mr. Ruel then addressed
the cruel Committee of the Senate-or the
Commitctee of the cruel Senate, whichever
way you put it. He said: "I have nothing
but appreciation te express for the unvarying
kindness and courtesy of this Committee tewards the Canadian National Bills"; and he
went on to express himself in that tone of
most cordial appreciation of kindness, courtesy
and consideration on the part of that Committee. Mr. Ruel, when he so spoke, was the
voice of President Thornton and the Board
of Directors of the Canadian National Railway.
Yet this kindness, courtesy and consideration had been transformed by the Prime
Minister of Canada by the time he reached
British Columbia into bitter denunciation of
the Senate for its attitude
towards these
people, who themselves said that they hid
nothing but appreciation of kindness and
courtesy.
I have before me a piece from the Daily
Province of Vancouver, which is the leading
newspaper in British Columbia.
In great
flaring headlines we have this statement:
Declares Senate made Thornton interview C.P.R.
King says if Kelowna line not built he w'll know
why. Appeal to Vernon voters. Asserts Yale should
return Liberal Bs fair play.

42

SENATE

Under that last heading I should just like
te read something which is significant:

in identical terms fron the Hon. George P.
Graham, reading thus:

Stressing the good treatment lie had given western
Canada though only a few Liberale had been elected
west of the Great Lakes at the general election, the
Prime Minister said-

The Senate made a condition in passing the Kamloops-Kelowna branch line Bill that no construction
should take place until an attempt had been made
by the presidents of both the C.N.R. and the C.P.R.
to negotiate a sale of the property to the C.P.R.
These negotiations have been in progress, which has
delayed construction.

This was at a mass meeting in the city of
Vernon.
You sent me only four or live members. I gave
you four Cabinet Ministers. Now I am appealing to
the electors of Yale on grounds of chivalry, fair play
and decency to send another member to Ottawa to
support western policies.

Chivalry, fair play, and decency. I would
like this honourable House to remember that:
a right honourable gentleman extoiling himself as an apostle of chivalry, fair play, and
decency, and in the name of those attributes
conducting the campaign which he conducted
against this Senate.
There had been sent out about that time
from a member of Mr. King's Government a
mcssage to the Liberal organizers in the
riding of Yale, where there was a by-election
on at the time. The people of Yale, who
had a railway under construction for a great
many years and nearly completed, requiring
only the buying and the laying of the raiis to
finish the job, had got restive because another year had passed and nothing had been
done. The President of- the Kelowna Board
of Trade addressed a message as follows:
Kelowna, October 2, 1924.
Sir Henry Thornton,
Montreal. Ruiors are again rife that Kelowna nay
be left in the hands of the C.P.R. by sale of branch
line to them. This would be extrermely unpopular
in the valley. Can you reassure us? Signed, Grote
Stirling, President.

To this he received a reply from President
Thornton as follows:
Montreal, October 3. Grote Stirling, President, Board
of Trade, Kelowna. Before passing Bill for this branch
the Senate instructed the two railways to endeavour
to find a solution that would give the most efficient
service at the minimum cost to the country. See
Senate Debates, pages 695 to 697. When the Bill
was passed, it was on the understanding that it was
enabling powers to put the Canadian National Railways in the sane position as the other road, and
with the understanding that the negotiations would
be continued and fully developed. Certain proposais
have been made to the Canadian Pacifia Railway, and
we are still awaiting their reply. Not in a position
to say more at present. (Signed) H. W. Thornton.

On the 3rd of October President Thornton
was not in a position to say anything. Sinultaneously with the arrival of that there came
a message from the Minister of Railways in
this Government.
The Minister of Railways did not address himself to the President
of the Board of Trade; his was a pureîy
political message, addressed to the Liberal
organizers in charge of the campaign.
The
general Federal Liberal organizer and the
local Liberal organizer received a despatch
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR.

Of course, when these messages arrived in
the Okanagan they aroused a very great deal
of feeling-not against President Thornton,
of course, because the official organizers of
the Liberal party would not be spreading propaganda against their friend Sir Henry Thornton, but against the Conservative members
of the Sénate, and expressly directed towards
them, and as to which the electors of Yale
were asked to wreak their vengeance on the
candidate of the Conservative party and send
him to Coventry, because of the supposed
misdeeds of his party. Of course, honourable
gentlemen who have heard me read these
messages know as well as I do that they do
not state the truth-that they are in themselves impossible. Anyone conversant with
parliamentary procedure recongizes at onca
that they are absolutely impossible, and they
could not be supposed to deceive any person
except an elector not versed in parliamentary
procedure and the limitations upon Parliament
in placing restrictions or understanding as
brakes on legislative enactments.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend is not 4luestioning in the least the exactness of the statements of Sir Henry Thornton and the Minister of Railways?
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR:

Oh, yes.
I listened to
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the telegrams very closely, and so far as my
memory carnes me I take it for granted that
that was the attitude of the Committee which
had this matter before it.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: As to President Thornton, I have a further message which is more
direct than the one I have read. This one
i have read was the first effort, and he did
not go the whole hog in it. There is another
one.
I am controHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
verting the statement of my honourable friend
that these telegrams did not convey exactly
what was donc by the Senate. The Committee of the Senate did ask these two railways to come together. I remember that very
clearly.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: I will read again the
political message of the Minister of Railways,

FEBRUARY 11, 1925
because I would much rather deal with him
than with the President of the Board, who is
not a member of Parliiament and who has not
the same opportunity of speaking for himself.
I will read again the message from this Minister:
The Senate made a condition in passing the Kambranch line Bill that no construction
ahould take place until an attempt had been made by
the presidents of both the C.N.R. and C.P.R. to
negotiate a eie of the property to the C.P.R. These
negotiations have been in progress, which has delayed
construction.

loops-Kelowns

With the exception of the last sentence,
I say that that message of the Minister of
Railways, the colleague of the honourable gentleman and for whom the honourable gentleman is responsible, is wholly false; that there
is not the first word of truth in it; and that
the records of the Senate abundantly estaiblish
that.
Of course, I
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
take it for granted that we are both very
clear in our conceptions of what the Senate
did. If my honourable friend speaks of the
action of this Chamber after the report from
the Committee was made, he may be able to
point to the record in order to show that
there is no trace of such an understanding;
and yet I would be surprised if in the discussion of this Bill, when it did come up for
exarnination in the general Committee or
upon the report of the Committee, or at the
third reading, there was not some statement
indicating the procedure that had been followed in the Committee. But if the Minister
referred to the work and the decisions of the
Committee, I think my honourable friend will
find that he stated exactly what took place in
the Committee, and that as a result of what
took place in the Committee action was taken
by the two railway presidents, who came together. So the statement of the Minister of
Railways is substantiated by the telegram
of the President of the railway, who declared
that he acted upon a decision of the Railway
Committee of the Senate. I have yet to
understand how my honourable friend can
make out that the statement of the Minister
of Railways was improper when he seems to
have stated exactly the undertaking imposed
by the Railway Committee upon the two railway companies.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Would my honourable friend pardon me a moment? We
do not want to have any misunderstanding
here as to the intent of a message so important as that of the Minister of Railways.
In the first place, it must be borne in mind
that the Minister of Railways would have no

43

means of knowing accurately what occurred
in the Railway Committee of the Senate; nor
would it be proper for him to communicate
it to the public at large.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, well, the
Minister's duty was to know what had taken
place in the Committee.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable
members of the Committee will recall that
negotiations did occur at the instigation of
the Railway Committee of the Senate. The
railways were not able to corne together to
reach an agreement because, as Sir Henry
Thornton indicated, they had made certain
proposals to the C.P.R., and up to the time
when the House had to deal with the Bill
The
they had not reached an agreement.
ITouse therefore proceeded to determine the
matter by legislation so that the people of
that community could have the service of
both railways, and passed a Bill accordingly,
and months afterwards the Minister of Railrays apparently sent a message that was
svholly misleading in its import.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am not read'y
to accept that statement, because I recollect
very well that this very matter was discussed
,n the Committee. We speak of the Committee because it practically took the place
cf the Committee of the Whole in the exI believe I inamination of these Bills.
formed the Committee-and if notes were
taken of what took place there I think they
will bear me out-that it was impossible in
the short time that remained before the closing of the Session, or at all events the closing of the Committee, for the two railways
to come together. There was a primary objection that the president of the C.P.R. was
not at his post in Montreal. I know that in
the course of negotiations I was informed
that it would be some time before the Canadian Pacifie Railway would be able to approach the subject with a view to an understanding. I think I was told that they would
have to send engineers out, which would
take some weeks or months before they would
be in a position to answer the letter of the
President of the Canadian National Railways
sent at the express direction of an unanimous
Railway Committee on that question. But
it was urged that the Bill should pass.
I notice that Sir Henry Thornton refers to
pages of Hansard. I myself urged that the
Bill should pass in order that the Canadian
National Railways would stand in the negotiations on an equal footing with the C.P.R.,
and it was, I think, because I insisted on
giving the Canadian National Railways

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR:
The honourable
gentleman will find that incident reportel in
the notes of the Committee. Those were the
parting words.
Let me recall this to bim, The Bili would
havc fallen by the wayside rigbt thon, only
that it was tcn minutes after one, wheroas
thehour for the hreaking up of the Committoo
as one o'clock, and the ýCommittee moved off
withoot action taken. On the resumptian at
8 o'clock in the ýevening, Mr. Macleod reappoared before the Committeo of bis own
volition and made a most spirited plea for
the passage of the Bill; pointed out to that
Committce that in bis opinion we woulýd retrieve the whole $5,500,000 alroady put into
the enterprise, and in addition receive the
inrtere,,t on theo $2,000,0OO whicb it was proposed to spond. Tbe road would pay from
the beginning.
The bonourable gentleman
will rot-aIlth~at an officiai of the C.P.R. was
called afterwards, -and flouted tbe wbole proposition as something impossible and ridiculeus, and that the proceodin.gs ended with the
only address whicb I made to the Comroittee
during the tbree weeks of its session. I
argued on bebaif of t.bis lino and its importance to the cemmunity and Vo the Canadian National as well. The Cominittee, immediately following that, unanimously passed
the Bill and sent it Vo, the .Senate.

Minister of Railways, made for political effeet

a decision which. was net reversed. The mandate given te our Secretary te ask the twe

Prosidents te came together was transmiitted
te the two companie, and I beiieve that it
devo'lves upon 'the President of te Canadian

National Radlways ta abide by the advie
that was conveyed Vo himn by the letter from
te Secretary of the Commnittee. And here
is the hetter:
June 20, 1924.
Sir-The Railway Commnittee of the Senate has had
under consideration Bill NO. 33, an Act respeting the
construction oif Canadian National Railway Line
Kamlops-Kelorwna
Division,
ýProvince
oif British
olumbia, copy encloeed.
The Committee has suspended consideration. of the Bill until Wedneelday
next, the 25th instant, in order that; the Canadien
National %lilwaysand the Canadian Pacifie Railway
Company snay corne together and examine jurta the
possîbility of providing a servioe ta the distr'ict at
the least possible outlay. The Comsnittee deaire that
you confer with the officers oif the Canadien Pacifie
Railway Comnpany and appear before the Rajlway
Committee on Wednesday next with your suggestions.

That was sent out te the two companies.
I was made aware of the fact that the Preei-

SENATE
dent of the Canadian National Railways had
obeyed that direction, and it was only when
we found that we could not get an answer
from the Canadian Pacific Railway, which
was entitled to examine into a proposition
which involved millions, that I made the
proposal. I was a party to that resolution,
and there was nothing that I did nor is there
anything in my mind, that is not open to-day
to the Senate and to Canada itself. I did
not play any political or any other game.
I was absent from America during the whole
month of October; so my state of mind is
that of June, 1924. I could enter into the
question, but I will not detain my honourable
friends in order to state what was in my
mind, but it is contained in this resolution,
which vas adopted unanimously by the Conmittee, asking those two parties to come together. I remember stating-and I think it
would be found that I said it from my seat
here-that the Canadian National should have
the power to build and that the proposed
Branch Line Bill should ,pass, in order that at
the outset and throughout the negotiations
they might be -on an equal footing with the
C.P.R.

ing to examine into each case en its merits
and to decide for the best, and we did that.

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Well, honourable gentlemen, as I said before, I had no objection
to the Comrnmittee examining the case on its
merits. I was present and heard what the
honourable gentleman se eloquently describes.
I heard his suggestion that the two presidents
should come together, and I had no fault to
find with it, and I have no fault to find with
it now, because I knew the policy of the
Canadian National non-political Management
to be to build that line, and I felt satisfied
that they would impress the necessity for the
second building upon the Canadian Pacifie
Railway. But contrast the statement we have
had here now with the political use made of
this incident by the Minister of Railways and
by the Prime Minister. Here is one of their
colleagues taking a Bill sent to him from the
House of Com'mons to be passed through the
Senate, and in the exercise of his right as a
leader of the Committee of the Senate suggesting that perhaps it is not necessary to
build this line at all. It is his right to suggest that. Nothing came of the suggestion in
the Senate Committee. The Committee in

when a direction was given to Sir Henry

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: I think the Senate

is a letter of a Secretary of a Committee of
the Senate, even though that letter be dietated by the leader of this Chamber.

This was a direct motion made to this
House as a body. In consequence of the remarks of the honourable gentleman who
leads this Senate, the three months' hoist was

when the Bill came before this Chamber? I
am very clear about this fact; that I stated
at the cutset that we could refer to what

the Comimittee practically replaced the Committee of the Whole.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: I will read to the
honourable gentleman what happened in this
Chamber. It is quite true that in this Chamber the honourable gentleman did suggest that
this was only an enabling Bill. As I sec it,
he had no authority whatever for that statement. The words were not in the Bill and
were net in the report of the Committee. I

conversation in the Senate or any other parliamentary body must net have a place in onactments. I supposed the honourable gentleman was letting himself down easy, and I

There was another honourable gentleman in

I cannot speak for him, but I cin recount his

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Oh, yes. the honourable gentleman said that. As I said, I took

that his object of withdrawing the Bil'l had not

when a man who is a leader in a body finds
himself at cross purposes with the majority of

in the Senate, every Senator from British
Columbia who voted, voted against the delsying motion. That is not all. The same
is true of every Senator from Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and, with one exception, it is true of Ontario. However, that is
not material.
It was not a Conservative
inajority; it was the unanimous wish of the
western Senators.
Mackenzie King proceeds to quote me as
sayng:
-that the BUll was passed without strings and that
the Government was instructed to proceed with construction.

Of course, I did not say it was instructed;
I said it was authorized by express provision
that the Government might supply the money
inî ad'vance of the sale of bonds.
Mr. King further quotes me as saying:
That because the Ross motion was defeated there
should therefore be no negotiations. I understand also
that Senator Taylor also stated that the Government
ilotted to defeat the Bill, that my colleague Senator
Dandurand was used by me for this purpose. I am
informed that Mr. Meighen has endorsed this statement.

Let me hasten to say that I never attempted
to libel the honourable gentleman who leads
this Chamber in the way indicated.
If I
had been stating which of those two gentlenen would use the other, I think I would have
reversed the order so flatteringly given to
himself by Mr. Mackenzie King.
I wish to say that any representations of this kind
if made by Senator Taylor or Mr. Meighen are wholly
without foundation and entir&y false.

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: I heard what the bonourable gentleman said.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: What did he say?
Are you a mind reader?
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: No, I am not a mind
reader, I say that an honourable member of

this Senate who is willing to accept the
imputation of falsehood might well be silent
on the subject, but I for one am not.
I
think it is a very fitting objection to take.
When an honourable member of the Senate
reads from a statement broadcasted by the
Prime Minister of this country to the effect
that this member and the leader of the
Opposition in the Commons have jointly been
guilty of deliberate falsehood, it is worth while
that someone should take notice of it

have no desire to discuss him at all. This i
from Mr. King:
I wish to state that any representations of this
kind if made by- Senator Taylor or Mr. Meighen are
wholly without foundation and entirely false.

That is, Mr. King says it is entirely false
that the honourable menber for Middleton
stated that his object in making this resolution was so and so. Mr. King says it is entirely false that the Senate passed this Bill
without any restrictions. The statute itself
establishes that. That the Government was
instructed to proceed with construction, he
says, is entirely false. If you substitute
"authorized" for "instructed" the statement
is entirely true, and the denial of it is as the
right honourable gentleman describes.
and that because the Ross motion was defeated, there
should therefore be no negotiations.

I say that the defeat of that motion was
official action by this Senate, preferring construction to negotiation. There can be no
question about that. Yet, withoutt any inquiry, the right honourable gentleman proceeds in his denunciation of the Senate bucause they followed a course whico ho knows
was desired by his own colleague and which
is justified by his colleague here to-day.
Now, let me say for the people of the
Okanagan that no person there is satisfied
with negotiation in place of construction; that

__7
FEBR-UARY 11, 1925
the unanimous desire of that cotnnnunity is
for connection with the Canadian National
Railways; that neither Mr. King nor any of
his campaigners would venture to recommend
negotiation to them. The only abject in
introducing this question there was to prejudice the cause of the Conservative party by
the false statement that the Conservatives in
the Senate had connived at délaying this
Bill,
Similarly, in the same campaign, they took
up another grievance against the Senate.
Hon. Mr. BELCOUJRT: May I asic my
honourable friend a question?
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Yes, sir.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Do. I understand
him to complain that the construction was
proceeded with to some extent-I do not
know to what extent--before the negotiations
were ecmpleted? In other words, does he complain that Ïhe construction was going on
pending negotiations?
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: I neyer dreamt of
such a thing.
My honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
friend from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) is
not from the Okanagan district.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Construction is
not started yet.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: The complaint I make
is this, that the right, honouraible bkentleman has slandered the Senate, and that he
malies hîs unprovoiced siýander of the Senate
the basis of his appeal to the country to deal
with the Senate, instead of dealing with the
Mackcenzie King Government.
He has slandered the Senate not only with
respect to the Kelowna Branch Line Bill, but
also with respect to another matter under dis-.
cussion Iast Session. I have not here anything under the hand of Mackcenzie King, but
I have the campaign literature of his Party
used in Yale Riding, and from this oampaign
literature I read:
Saldier Legislation
The Mackenzie King Glovernxnent lias endeavaured
for two years ta secure justice for disabled ex-service
men and Vheir dependents, but have beau blocked by
the Senate having a large Canservative miajority.
This just legisiation can only be secured b3' the reforus
of the Senate.

Then there is a quotation £rom Hansard
of July 19, the bWood and thundor utterances
of the Prime Minister, contrastir.g se pitifuly
with this little paragraph in the Speech from
the Throne before us to-day asicing for a
provincial coniference. Let me recail what
happened with respect to that. This Bill was

presented to the Senate from the House of
Commons by the honourable gentleman, the
colleague of Mackcenzie King who leads the
Senate (Hon. Mr. Dandurand). We &Il ricaîl the expressions cdf
mild horror with which
he presented the Bill: his misgivings, no
doubt justified, as to what the Bill involved;
his regret that it came to us sQ late that it
was almost imnpossible for us ta become

ail recall also what happened. It went to %i
Committee, not of the Conservative majority of the Senate, but a Committee constituted of four members from one side and
four from, the other, and unanimously appointed. The Committee met. I was not a
member and was not present, but I understand that it took the evidence of only a
couple of responsible officiais of the depart,mente concerned in the legislation, whom it
called as experts. The Committee's report
wa-Q arrived at unanimously by the honourable members constituting the Comnaittee,
and it came into this House, presented by
the Chairman (Hon. Mr. Pardce), who hiac
recently been the Chief Whip of the Lîberal
party, the party of Mackcenzie King, and was
adopted by the Senate. I arn not sure tliat
it was adopted unanimously here. There
were, I think, one or two military gentlemen opposite who took exception to some oi
the contents, but the report was almost
unanimously adopted by this Chainber. It
was accepted by the colleague of the Right.
Hon. Maekeuzie King wýho sits in this Chamber (Hon. Mr. Dandurand); accepted by
him as a minber of the Commîttee and as
leader of the Senate. Yet the right honourable gentleman, the leader of our leader,
says:
This year we have instances of Bills tha4 have
paased this Haouse in three separate Sessions of Parliarnent, and which have beeu rejected each time by
the second Chsanber. I desire ta assura the Hanse ta

One would tiiink "the quiecest manner possible" would be to asic for the Tesignation of
the colleagije of the right honourable gentleman, who had consented te this action in
this Chamber, much as I would regret to see
such a request acted upon. If quick action
were desired by the righ-t honourable gentleman, it seems to mne that that would be the
quickest possible. I yield to no persan in my

52

SENATE

respect for the honourable gentleman (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand), but his continued presence
as spokesman in this Chamber for the Government is evidence that the leader of the
Government is not taking the quickest possible action to remedy this condition of affairs.
I am sorry I have taken so long, but when
the existence of this Senate is challenged by
the right honourable the leader of the Government in a by-election, and when that honourable leader not only promulgates statements which are directly contrary to the
facts of record, but also carelessly and wilfully
imputes falsehoods to other public men engaged in the campaign because they differed
from him, it seems to me that the matter
is well worth the attention of this Chamber.
For my part, as a humble member of Parliament, who had observed many parliaments
before becoming a member, I think one of
the most prized assets of any parliament is
the honesty, the integrity, and the truthfulness of its members.
Hon. J. G. TURRIFF: Honourable gentlemen, it was not my intention to take any part
in this debate, but in reading in the Senate
Hansard the proceedings of last niglht I find
my name mentioned two or three rimes; so
I wish to take this opportunity of saying a
few words.
Last year, it will be remembered, the honourable Senator from De Lanaudière (Hon.
Mr. Casgrain) made the statement several
times-and he made it in my hearing-that
the great profits of the railways were made
in Eastern Canada and that it was paying for
ber railways. In his statement of last night
he referred to the fact that the people of
Saskatchewan have paid only $2 per head in
income tax while the people of Quebec have
paid $10. That statement is likely true, but
there is this to be borne in mind, that the
people of Saskatchewan and Manitoba and
the West generally pay hundreds of thousands
and even millions of dollars profit to the
merchants and importers of Montreal. That
enables them to pay their ineome tax. Directly
and indirectly, it means that the people Of
Saskatchewan are contributing to that tax,
and the merchants of Montreal are getting the
benefit of the income.
The particular item with which I wish to
deal is the profit that is made by the Canadian
Pacifie Railway Company in the West as compared with that of the East. I say again, and
I defy contradiction, the C.P.R. has made its
money in the past and is now makina its
money much more in the West than in the
East.
It is a matter of fact, as proven by
the C.P.R. itself, that the dividends on0 its
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR.

stock are made practically by the profits
earned in the West.
Those profits have been
made in the past and are made up to the
present time principally by the carriage of
wheat, and some of it is transported down ta
the East.
The figures I intend to present
are not those which my honourable friend from
De Lanaudière tried to give us last Session,
from some man prominent in railway affairs,
who was either afraid or ashamed to give his
name.
My honourable friend from De
Lanaudière wanted to take those figures as
conclusive.
I will give you, not haphazard
figures, but sworn figures presented ny the
principal officers of the Canadian Pacifie
Railway to the Railway Department of the
Government.
I am going to quote now fron
the evidence of Mr. Symington, who states
in that evidence that these figures are from
the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.
He
states that in a five-year period the operating
expenses of the Canadian Pacifie were as
follows: Eastern lines, $160,000,000; Western
lines, $231,000,000.
Before dealing further with these statisties
may I refer to what took place last year, in
order
that
honourable
gentlemen
may
thoroughly understand the situation. The
honourable member from De Lanaudière (Hon.
Mr. Casgrain) was speaking.
He was trying
tG make out that the great profits of the
Canadian Pacifie Railway were made on the
Eastern lines, and I asked him a question:
Do I understand from the remarks he made the
other day, and those he has made now, that the
railways make more money on their Eastern lines than
on their Western lines?
Hon. Mr. Casgrain: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Turriff: If I am in order nowHon. Mr. Casgrain: You are not in order; we are
all out of order.
Hon. lr.
Turriff: I just want to give that statement an absolute denial, and assert that the C.P.R.
and the Canadien National Railways make double
the money net profit-

Remember, I am speaking of net profik, not
gross receipts.
-in the West that they do in the East; and I will
take the first opportunity when the House meets again
of putting the figures on Hansard, beccuse I have
them right here.

It so happened, honourable gentlemen, that
I was unable to make good that statament
because I was taken ill; but I propose to do
t now. Last night, when the matter was
under discussion, the honourable gentleman
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. MeMeans) asked
the honourable gentleman some questions.
One thing the honourable gentleman from
De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) said'
wVas:
Will my honourable friend tell us where -to find the
deficits?

in the West it casts 60 cents ta ern a dollar. The
net earnings in the East were $43,.000 and in the
West 891,500,000; that is, the net earninge after
dedueting operating expense were 8,000,000 more in
the West, or 110 per cent greater.

So you see, honourable gentlemen, the net
profits on the western lines in those five years
were more than double what they were on
the eastern lines. I arn speaking of the Canadian Pacifie Railway.
T-hat is the sworn
evidence of the officers of the Canadian
Pacifie Railway, and there is no getting
around it at ail.
Then, the figures for the five years front
1912 to, 1916 are as follows:
Operating revenues: East, $226,500,000; Wet, $W5,500,000, the West being 57J per cent higher than the
East.
Operating ratio: East, 73.8; West, 57; prairie West,
54.5. The West net earnings were $92,500,000 greater
than the East, or 154 per cent greater.
Net earnings: East, 840,000,000; West, 8152,500,000.

Then Hon. Mr. Crerar asks:

'Yes, these are C.P.R. figures.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: What is the honourable gentleman reading front? What la the
book?
Hon. Mr. TUJRRIFF: It is the report of
the Committee of the House of Commons on
Railway Transportation Coats, 1922-.
Wtien the first of these figures I arn reading
were made the Canadian Northern Railway
'vas flot compieted, so I, can only take the
C.P.R. figures. Mr. Symington. says:
They are figures furnishied by thenselves at our
request on -these various rate cases before the Railway Comnnsion.

They are also the samne figures that were
ipresented ta the Board of Railway Commissioners by the C.P.R. officiaIs under the Act.

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: As a matter of fact,
practicaily all thie dividends made by the
C.1'.R. and paid out ta the holders of the
common stock are madle up of the excess
profits made ini tige West over and above
those made in the East.
fton. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Oh, Oh.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: My honourable friend
may laugh. Tfiese figures corne front the
C.P.R. offici ais themseives. Re is a director

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Oh, no, I arn not.
Hon. Mr. TURRIEF: And I presume a
good large stock-holder. I arn very giad that
he jets bis dlvidezids fro~m the West; but
honourabie gentlemen should not be so neady
to blàme the West and to say liat thé profits ccdme from the East when that is flot the
case.
Now I want to give you the figures for 1921.
That is only four years ago. The operaiting
revenues in the East were 885,500,000, andr ini
the West $101,900,000. That ii, thé operating- revýenues in the West were $16,500,00
more than those in the East, or le per cent
greater. The operating revenue was: East
77.2-1; West, 70.54. The operating expenses
are much less in the West, and naturs.lly net
profits are rnuch greater. The net earnings
for that one year were: in the East $11,d00,000; in the West, $30,000,000, or nearly
three times as much. The net eatnings in the
West weré $19,000,000 more than those in the
East, or 107'per cent greater.
Mr. Symington was asked:
Q. Where do you get these figures?-A. From the
C.P.R. * filed with the Board af Railway Commissioners,
in the rate, case which we have juet b.een arguins. and
filed at the requet of the goveroments I represent.

Tho.t is, the Manitoba Government.
Here is seme further enlightenment on the,

54

SENATE

net profits made by the C.P.R.
Crerar asked:

Hon. Mr.

Q. These figures are for what period?-A. The last
6 months of 1920, when you will understand the large
increase in grain rates came into effect in time to
catch the 1920 crop. In July on eastern lines the net
was $622,000, western lines, $1,053,000; August, eastern
lines $855,000; western lines, $1,654,000. There is not
a great deal of discrepancy in anything perhaps that
anybody can complain of there. In September there
is a little more grain moved from southern Manitoba.
The grain ripens in September and bas been shipped.
The figures for September are, for the East, 31,379,000:
for the West, $2,759,000. In October, East, 31,400,000;

West, $6,588,000.

So the net profit of the C.P.R. on the
eastern lines for the month of October was in
the East 81,400,000, in the West, $6,588,000.
In November the East made a net profit to
the railway of $416,000, and the West a profit
of $4,948,000, or more than ten times as
much. In December the profit in the East
amounted to $139,756, and in the West to
$3,828,951, making a grand total for eastern
lines of $4,871,830, and for western lines $20,822,726. You will notice that the net earnings
in July and August in the West are $1,000,000
and 81,600,000 respectively. Some of ithe
grain moved in September, and the net jumped
ta $2.700,000. October, gave a net profit of $6,588,000, as I said. before, the largest at any
time 'in the history of the Canadian Pacific
Railway.
In the fa-ce of these figures, given by the
C.P.R. officials, and sworn ta, how can my
honourable friend try to make this House
and the public believe that the C.P.R. makes
more money in the East than in the West?
Taking not the receipts, but the net profits,
I say the railway makes more money on the
western end of its business than it does on
its eastern end.
Just here let me say that there is now a
good deal of discussion about the Crowsnest
rates. I sec by the eastern press that there
is a good deal of talk about the West getting
special rates, and about discrimination against
the East. I want ta say right here and now
that if the old Crowsnest rates were put into
force in toto, they would include 15 or 20
items of goods largely manufactured in the
East, and there would be only two items in
the whole list on which the rates would be
higher than the rates in the West. In the face
of that, what 1is the use of people complaining
that we in 'the West are getting too low rates,
when the lowest rates would be higher than
the general rates down East?
To make the
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER:
matter clear, may I ask the honourable
gentleman where he makes the division between the East and the West?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF.

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: At Fort William.
East of Fort William are the eastern lines,
and west of that point the western lines.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: How are the profits
Suppose a
ascertained in each division?
carload of goods leaves Montreal and is
freighted through ta Vancouver, how is the
profit divided?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: All the railways
keep account of the cost of carrying a carload of freight from its shipping point ta
its destination. The western lines are credited
with the freight as far east as Fort William.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Just on that point.
Practically all the grain of the West is shipped
ta Port Arthur and stops there The eastern
lines do not get very much out of grain. In
the shipments going from the East ta the
West, say from Montreal, the western lines
would get considerabile profit.
My honourable
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF:
friend is going on the assumption that we
ship nothing but wheat in the West. There
is no doubt that wheat is the big itemwheat and cereals; but that is one of the
commodities in Canada on which the railways make the most profit. In many cases
a carload of wheat runs 80,000 or 100,000
lbs. The wheat is hooked on at some elevator in Saskatchewan or Manitoba, and it
is run in train loads ta Fort William or
Port Arthur. There it is shunted onto a siding or spotted up ta the elevator, and the
car unloaded in perhaps 20 minutes. Then
the elevator people shunt the cars back ta
a siding and the railway company takes them
back west again. No time is lest, and there
is no cost of loading or unloading. There
is no other commodity that the railroad
carries that gives the same profit as wheat
and oats and barley and flax. There is a big
profit, and very little expense
You will notice how the figures went up in
July and August. There is not much difference between the profit in the East and those
in the West until you come to September;
then the profits in the West go right up.
When you come ta October and November
the profits in the West in some months
amount ta nearly ten times as much as they

do in the East. That is sinpy because it
takes about 55 cents to earn a dollar there,
and it takes 70 odd cents ta earn a dollar
on the mixed traffic of the East, Of course
there is mixed traffic in the West also, but,
as I said a few moments ago, wheat is the

principal item on which the profit is made
there.

speech of the present president
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I suppose I will
have to go on although. my hanourable
fricnd has gone. 1 would have liked him to
hear this statement of Mr. Dr.slongchaînps.
He said:
It la vital that the internai and external condition
regponsible for the present chaotic state of the ehoe
nminufacturing industry ini Canada should bc remedied
if the industry ia to eurvive.

There ie an industry which bas its main
home for this country in the province of
Quebcc, and it is now suffering, if not dying,
hecause the present administration prefers to
have boots irnported not oflly from Great
Britain but froin Germany through Great
Britain. And stili it je contendcd that the
present policy suite the country What surpri,âes me, honourable gentlemen, je that the
Governmnent je able to continue the policy
that it has adopted.
Industrially, there is no doubt that Quebec
has been j1l-treatcd. There je no ather terni
for it. IV,je on that aocount that we are
losing so many of our countrymen by their
going acrose the lime. Without any doubt the
restoration of a reasonable amount of proteotion would keep our children at home,
and may be would bring back a good many
who have had ta leave their own country
and to go across the line to find work in industries of ail sorts.
I suppose, honourable gentlemen, that whcn
you attenmpt a thing and succeed, it incites
you to continue. After havirg ill-treated
the province of Quebec industrially, these
gentlemen are attexuptting to do eomcthing
else .which, to my mimd je very much more
eerious. They arc attacking the province of
Quebec constitutionally. For the first time
since Confederation we sec a Governmcnt
aiming a 'blow-ýbecause it je nothing elscat the fortress oif minority rights in the
Dominion. Indeed, there is no doubt that
the Senate was created by the Confederation
pact the trustee of the righte of minorities.

a

Liberal, who came to this House, if 1 mistake mot, rather prejudiced against it, and

ideas on the subject. I refer to Sir George

Ross.
I would like first to quote what Sir John
Macdonald said in reference to the creation
of this House; then I will ask honourable
gentlemen te hear what the Hon. George
Brown stated, se that we mtay the better
understand the thought and purpose of the
ïathers of Confederation. This is what Sir
John Macdonald said on the 6th day of
February, 1865, when the resolutions adopted
oy the Conference of Quebee were discussed
before the Parliament of Canada:
In order to protect local interests and to prevent
sectional jealousies, it was found requisite that the
three great divisions into which British North America
is separated should be represented in the Upper House
on the principle of equality. There are three great
sections, having different interests, in this proposed
Federation. We bave western Canada, an agricultural
country, far away from the sea, and having the largest
population, with agricultural interests principally to
guard.
We have Lower Canada with other and
separate interests, and especially with institutions and
laws which she jealously guards against ber absorption
by any larger, more numerous and stronger power.
And we bave also the Maritime Provinces, having
also eali sectional interests of their own, having
owing te their position, classes and interesta which
we do not know in Western Canada. Accordingly,
in the Upper House, the controlling and regulating,
but not initiating branch, we have the sober second
thought in legislation, which ls previded in order
that each of these great sections shall be represenated
equally by 24 members. . . . To the Upper House
is to be confined the protection of sectional interests,
and therefore it is ýthat the three great divisions are
there equally represented for the purpose of defending
such interests against the combinations of majorities
in the Assembly.

The Hon. George Brown in the same debate said:
Our Lower Canada friends have agreed to give us
representation by population in the Lower House, on
the condition that they shall have equality in the
Upper House, and on no other condition could we have
advaneed a step, and for my part I am quite willing
that they shall have it. In maintaining the existing
sectional boundaries, and handing over the control of
local matters to local bodies, we recognize to a certain
extent the diversity of interests, and it was quite
natural that a protection for these interests by
equality in the Upper House should be demeanded by
the less numerous provinces. . . . If from this concession to equality in the Upper Chamber they are
restrained fron forcing through neasures which our
friends of Lower Canada may consider injurious to
their interests, we shall at any rate have power which
we never had before to prevent them from forcing
through whatever we may deem unjust to us. I think
the compromise a fair one, and am persuaded that
it will work easily and satisfactorily.

The present honourable gentleman, to the
best of my knowledge, is the first attack
ever made by the Government against the
Senate. I will ask permission in a moment
te refer te discussions that have taken place
on the subject. We are now witnesing,
under cover of a very inoffensive paragraph
in the Speech from the Throne, the very first
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

attack against the Constitution of our country, and against that part of the Constitution
which should be and is most sacred te the
Province of Quebec. And that attack comes
from a Government that lives solely through
the good graces of the province of Quebec.
I do not want to refer to the speeches which
have been delivered by the Prime Minister
and others. That of course would lead me
far afield, and I do not think would increase
the weight of my argument. I think I can
crystallize my argument by saying that the
accusation brought against this House for
exclusively political purposes is to my mind
extremely injurious, because it is creating
propaganda against the Constitution of the
country. In a word, the Prime Minister and
those who have spoken in the same strain,
have described this House as a narrow and
reactionary body, partisan and obstructive in
its policy and operating as a drag on the
wheel of progress, and having littie to do but
protect the rich and privileged classes. It
is spoken of as an instrument used in turn
by both parties to serve their purposes.
Now, honourable gentlemen, will you allow
me to refer very briefly to history to disprove
those accusations? No accusation, I believe,
was ever made with se little justification.
Since Confederation the Senate of Canada has
fulfilled its role fully as well if not better than
the House of Commons. It has never rejected important measures without serious
cause, and if I may rapidly refer to the Bills
dealt with by it through a period of years, I
hope you will agree with me that it has betrayed no excessive zeal and surely no partisanship.
Sir George Ross in his book states that from
the time of Confederation te 1913, 5,871 Bills
were sent to this House by the House of
Commons. Of this number 1,246 or 21.5 per
cent were amended, and 113 or 2 per cent were
rejected. During the same period the Senate
sent to the House of Commons 1,294 Bills, of
which 396 or 31.4 per cent were amended and
113 or 8.1 per cent were rejected. In other
words, honourable gentlemen, the action of
the House of Commons in dealing with measures that went to it from this House was
about four times as drastic as the action of
this House in dealing with Bills that came to
it from the House of Commons.
Now let us see whether any party has been
able te use the Senate for it.s political preferment. If I may, I will use the words of Sir
George Ross for that purpose:
This statement shows that the House of Commons
has been more drastic in its amendment and rejection of Senate Bills than the Senate has been of

THE GOVERÎNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday further
consideration of Bis Exciellency the Governor
General's Speech at the -opening of the Session,
and the motion of Hon. 'Mr. Robinson for an
Address in reply thereto.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN (continuing): Bonourable gentlemen, at the Iast meeting of the
Bouse I referred briefly ta past history in
order to demonstrate te the best of my
ability the purposes which the Fathers of
Confederation had in their minds-and perhaps I mig.ht add the hopes which. they had in
their hearts-in creating -the Senate in its
present form. I endeavoured te, follow that
up by demonstrating that, as far as a human
instrument could do se, the Senate had attained those purposes and fuffilled those
hopes. If you will be good enough te be
patient for a few moments longer I will endeavour te close that argument.
The first period te which I referred covered
some forty-six years following Confederation.
During that time, strange te say, the Senate
showed itself very much more lenient in dealing wi.th measures that came te it from the
Bouse af Comanons than the Bouse of Commens did in dealing with measures that went
te it fromn this Chamrber. During that first
period we find that, after alI, the public legislation which. came te this body, created expressly for control over such legislation, was
net very much distur-bed, only 2 or 3 per cent
of the Blls which were sent te us each y-ear
being rejected. That is, it seems te me, a

60

SEN ATE

very rnodest percentage, nlot in any way betraying a fbted intention on the part of tbis
Cýhamber to antagonize the opinions or sentiments of the pupular bouse. I thk,
hionourable gentlemen, tbat it bas been demonstrated that tbe SeiLate bas net been a partizan
body. Strange as it may seern, because after
ail we have set ideas in politics, very often
tbe party controlling botb bouses had it-s
measures more severely treated by this bouse

than wben the political tenets of tbe two
Houses were different.
Now, bonourable gentlemen, I would crave
your patience wbhile I dilate upon a matter
wbicb to my mind is more important tban percentag-es. The objection must bave arisen in
your mind: " True, tbe Senate býas interfered
witb onily 2 or 3 per cent of the legislation,
but tbat was rnade up of important measures

wbicb tbe popular bouse deerned to be essential to the welfare of the public." Sueb is
not the case. Altbough we find, in closely
s'tudying tbe course of legisiation from one
Hotîse to tbe other, tbat some of the measures
to wbich the party in control in the lower
bouse attacbed a great deal of importance
were amended, vitally amended, or even rejected, yet, honourable gentilemen, we must
remember that tbis body was freely created by
tbe public. Tbe Senate of Canada is no pocket
edition of tbe bouse of Lords. We have bee-n
put in a position of trust by a free people.
After ahl, those wbo created tbis body were
free to do so, and they bave selected us, as
tbey have selected the Crown and the other
Hotîse.
We do nut spring from old families
holding their titles or positions maybe from
piracy, certainly from a strong ia.nd, applied
in m.anv cases without justice and to the great
detriment of the people as a wbole. No, bionourable gentlemen:
use spring from; the
democracy just as much as tbose wbo sit
in the other bouse.
Why, bonourable gentlemen. let us look around these benches. bous
many whoa add strengIth to this very

bouse have corne from the popular bouse?
Have they cbanged because they are sitting
bere? Have tbey modified their ideas? Do
tbey net come from the public every Session,
and do they not go back to the public after
every Session and mix with the peuple,
breathe the saine air usith tbern, and rernain
as democratic as the members of the bouse of
Commons?
Therefore I think it is right to say that
there is aIl the difference in the world between
the bouse of Lords and the Senate of Canada.
This is a dernocratic
instittution
created for tbe purpose of controlling legislation.
This body bas received a trust wbich
Hon.

Mr.

BEAUBIEN.

it bas to discharge, and when importaxlt
legisiation cornes before it the consideration
that we must have uppermost in oui- minds
and consciences is the discharge of that trust
without fear, wbatever may be the threats
made against us, even if they corne from a
Prime Minister and the whole of his party.
Now, let us refer to the measures of importance that have corne to us in the past,
and let us see how the public b!as viewed the
action of the Senate.
I arn stili appealing
to the sarne authority that I cited yesterday,

one that will not be questioned on ei'ther side
of tbe bouse.
Sir George Ross was a man
of talent; hie was a dyed-in-the-wool Grit,
I believe for ail bis life.
Hie entered this
House laden witb prejudice against it, but he
cbanged bis mind, and this is the resuit of bis
experience during the tirne that he passed in
-this bouse, giving bis services to the nation.
Wbat does hie say in reference to certain
important measures whicb were proposed by
the lower bouse and rejected by this flouse
during the first 46 years after Confederation?
Here it is:
Notwititanding the protection afforded the Senatby the Constitution, nnd the similarity in origin and
status becw ýen the members off the two Chambers,
there have bien cases, of publie importance, in wlîich
che action off the Senate was regarded as a wanton
interference
with the prerogatives of the popular
Chaniber.
I cite the following as aniong the most
notable:1. The rejeetion of the Bill for the construction off
the Esquiînalt and Nanaimo Railway, during Mackenzie's admiinistration.
2. The rejection off the Bill for the construction off
a railway from Atlin to Dawson City, under the Laurier adnministration.
3« Tht amendient of a Bill for the purchase of tht
Drtîmnond County Railway, under tht Laurier administration.
4. Tht amendînent of a Bill for the Improvement off
Higliways, under tht Borden administration.
5. Tht postpouiement of the Naval Aid Bill, under
tht Borden administration.
As to tht first three, it mnay be fairly said that their
rej ection or aîîendîuent, however mucli resented at tht
timîe by their promoters, is regarded bv vers' few at
the~ preserit tiru" as d'eserving off censure. Of tht first
two neither was re-suhroitted.
Tht third waa so,
amended as to be acceptable on its rt-introduction,
aud at tht worst only delayed tht purposes off its.
promoters ont year.
Tht fourth w'as twice arnended,
snd the auîendcm",nts off tht Sejiate twîce re.jeced bv
thc iouse of Couiniîons, sud tht fiftî
was delayed
outil the verdict off tht electors could bt ohtaiîîed un
th2 dissolution off Parliament.

I desire to cite Sir George furtber on this
subject:
Nor dots experience, at least in Canada, show tîtat
tht soher second thought off tht people, as exprtssed
by tht Senate, was not in tht lest analysis ffound to be
the opinion which stood the test off mature relection,
while it bas happened
nmore than once that the
opinion of the Huse off C,,mmns was rejsctesd hy tht
people on whost hehaîf, par excellence, it claimed to,
speak. For instance, tht House off Communs in 1878,
under Mackenzie, helieved it represented public opinion
on tht national policy. The elections which, ffollowed

FEBRUJARY 12, 1925
proved it was mistaken. And s0 umder Sir Mackenzie
BowelI on the Remedial Bill in 1896, and under Sir
Wilfrid Laurier on Reciprocity in 1911. On no occasion
has the Senate been overruled by the electors, although
it lias oiten overruled the opinion of the House of
Commons.

May I now refer briefly te the second period,
fromn 1912 and 1913 to 1924. 1 hold in my
ha.nd a complete list of the Bis frein the
How~e of Commons, which were rejected by
this Flouse, and I desire to thank the clerk
,of this Flouse for the very useful work which
he -has done in that respect. These Bis number
41 ini ail, their number being materially increased by the Raii-way Bis which were recently submitted to us. This eovers a period
of 13 years, and honourabie gentlemen will
readily see that the percentage of rej ections
remains about the saime.
In other words,
the control exercised by this Flouse bas continued. Grist has been brought to the miii,
and the same amoumt of chaff has been thrown
aside as being unfit.
But, again, I suppose the objection will be
made that if the number of Bis rejected
has not increased, the value of certain of
these measures, paramount in the opinion of
the people, should have been recognized.
Well, bonourable gentlemen, it bas been only
within the last two Sessions. I think, that we
have seriously locked horng with the other
Flouse. Do I need to refer particularly to the
reasons for the quarrel between these two
bodies? There was the question of railway
extensions in 1923.
Surely my Jaonourabie
friends oppoýsite will require no justification
for the rejection of these measures. It was
evident that this Flouse couid not intelligentIly- perform its duty if these Bis were
thrust dlown its throat in the dying d'ays of
the Session,.
Practically the saine Bils were referred to
us iast Session, with the addition of the Pensions Bill. That also, honourabie gentlemen,
came to us within a very short time before
prorogation. Everybody knows that it was
physicaiiy impossible for us bonestly to say
whether the distribution of the enorrnous
sum provided for in tihe Bill was made
meritoriously. Could we determîne that question in a few hours? That was impossible.
And what hwppened? Iff my memory serves
me aright, the existîng legisiation was extended,
and nobody suffered at ail; and now we are
as frac to deal with the subi ect as we wcre
lest year-if oniy the Governmant wili bring
down the measure early enough during this
Session.
The question of raiiway extensions needs no
-comment on my part. Evarybody knows that
the Railway Committee of this Flouse, and
then the entire Senate, gave to this matter

more than passing attention. No honest man
can po>iut to any of thosa Bis and say that
it was d'ealt with hastily or without due
consideration. Every ona of thesa Bis was
oarefully weighed by us, much more carefully, dnideed, than in another place. As to
thosa that were set aside, we may say,
"Errare bumanus est "--to arr is human;
but 'that we have erred intentionally I dany;
that we did not apply to the task bafore
us ahil the intelligence and good wiîl of which
we were capable, I deny.
Let us pass now to the third Bill. That
is a particuiarly sore spot amongst a very
important portion of our community. That
Bill came to us for the second time, and~ for
the second time we made the samne objection.
We said: There are two reasons why the Bill,
or rather the amandment to the Act, shouId
not pass. First, it would work an injustice.
Wbereas it would bind one portion of the
community, it is evident that it could not ba
binding on the other portion. Wheraa8 it
wouid operata so far as capital -was concerned,
it ecould not operate on the side of labour.
But there was enother reason, which under the
crrcuinstance waâ paramount, which wes the
the proposed amendmnent was cleariy iseconstitu-tional. What bas heppenad? We have
just Îheard of the decision of the Privy Council,
randered on tha 25th of J.anuary 'lest. Whet
does it sey? Thet the vie"s held by the
Senate wera absolutely right. And now the
entira lagisiation bas gona by the board. It
was cieadIy an invasion of the rights of the
Provinces, and, so the Privy Counoil bas
deieided.
Than, bonourebia gentlemen, if we bave
not deait too severaly witb the lagisiation
coming to us from the other Flouse, if in the
case of the more important Bills we baâ',
eftar ail, good resoens to ect as we did,
why-tbis is the question I want te put to
the Government-wby are we visited now
with the menace that hangs over our beads?
Why this visitation?
Honourable gentlemen, it seems passing
stranga thet for the first time sinca Confedieration. wa are seriously menaced; for I
consider it a sarious menace. Although I do
not agree with tbem. I bave too mucb respect
for many of the members of the Cabinet to
think that this is notbing but bombestic talk.
I regard it as a serious tbreat. Why does it
corna from a Government that practically
holds its lease of if e from. the Province that
most requires tbe protection of the Senete?
I do not like to take a sectional point of
view in discussing eny measura, but bere the
Constitution compeis me tc do so. Do not
forget, honourable gentlemen, that when the

62

SENATE

Senate was created sectional interests were
recognized, and the duty was imposed on
every one of us of protecting such interests;
and now it is my duty-that is why I am
speaking-it is my duty to speak for my
Province. What I say on behalf of my Province might well be endorsed, I think, in
large measurel by members who represent
other Provinces here; but in this particular
instance I have no mandate to speak for
other Provinces. When sectional rights are
menaced 1 am authorized to act only for my
Province-or, perhaps I should say, in view
of the Constitution, for my division, since
my Province, in order that sectional rights
might be duly pýrotected in every respect, has
been oarved, into divisions and each division
has been placed under the charge of one
Senator. Therefore it seems to me that it
is not only my right. but my duty, to speak
for the Province of Quebec. I say it is
passing strange that a Government whose
life depends almost entirely upon that Province which gives it 65 members, should
go now before the country and for the first
time lift its hand against this House and
again,7t the Constitution of this country.
But people may say: "My friend, you are
:n error. Why, the Senate has always been
attacked." Will you allow me to mention
the attacks that have been made in the
past-attacks that had nothing to recommend
them but the vocal power from which they
emanated-attacks that were clearly directed
where no harm could be done? Let me
rapidly review them.
Hon. David Mills in 1874 suggested that the
Senators should be appointed by the Provinces. Well, that matter was disposed of in
the House of Commons without even the compliment of a vote.
From 1874 to 1905 not one word was said
aga-inst the Senate. Then, in 1906 and in 1908
Mr. MeIntyre, then member of Parliament
for Perth, suggested that the tenure of office
of Senators should be modified. The matter
was disposed of, as in the first instance, without even the compliment of a vote.
Then came the proposal of Sir Richard
Scott, who in 1909 wanted the Senate to be
made elective. This new proposition met
the same fate: no vote. The matter was
thrown aside.
Mr. Lancaster, member for Lincoln, in 1909
and 1910, suggested the abolition of the Senate,
and when the question was put to a vote, out
of the whole House of Commons only 22 voted
in favour of it. Mr. Lancaster was not satisfied, and came back in 1911 with a similar
proposition. What happened then? Not even
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

the yeas and nays were called. That was the
end of the chapter.
And remember, honourable gentlemen, that
on those occasions everyone knew that the
menace to the Senate was absolutely futile.
Everybody knew that even if such a resolution
had been passed it was of no avail.
But what have we before us to-day? It is
very much more serious. If the Government
is sincere, what has it te do? What is the
procedure te be followed? How must the
members of the Government train their guns
if they want to shoot at the Senate? There
is the procedure indicated by Sir George Ross,
and when I have read it honourable members of this House may form their opinion
as to the value of the polite, secretive little
menace contained in the Speech from the
Throne. Here is what Sir George Ross says:
But while the amendment to the Constitution in the
last analysis rests with the Imperial Parliament, the
preliminary stages by which it reaches the Imperial
Parliament should be followed with the utrnost care and
deliberation. As I understand the Constitution, these
stages are three in number1. Consent of all the parties that merged their
sovereignty or any part thereof in the Constitution.
2. Approval of the Amendments proposed by both
fHouses of the Parlianent of Canada.
3. Ratification by an Act of the Imperial Government.

I heard the honourable leader of the
House say, "Hlear, hear." He evidently approves of what I have read; that is to say,
that a Government who realiy means business,
who is not trying to fool the people, but

really wants to abolish or curtail the powens
of the Senate, must follow that procedure
And they have deliberately initiated it. Now,
I am not going to be frightened, honourable
gentlemen, at the immediate consequences of
the Government's move. I know full well
that if they hold a conference with the Provinces there will be no agreement. What I do
fear is not that at all, because I have examined the record of the Senate and find no
reason for the Government's interference and
its avowed desire to amend the Constitution.
I have looked somewhere else. I have listened
carefully to what has been going on in the
country. I have heard complaints from the
West, from many of our citizens; and they are

very respectable, many of them. Though not
deep-rooted in this country, they will, with
time, become more and more attached to the

land and to the traditions of our glorious
past, like the great mass of the people of this

country.

And what have those people in the

West, or certain sections of them, said? They

have compiained that the Senators refused
to grant them certain railway extensions, and
they have asked the almighty Liberal party

FEBRUARY 12, 1925
to, present them with thbe Senate's head as
soon as it could 'be eut off.
What else have I heard? I bave listened
and have heard from another portion of our
population, though less nuinerous than might
be supposed, who are also clamnouring for the
rermoval of the Senate because, forsooth, it
prevents the adoption of legislation which is
considered to be progressive. 1 refer, honourable gentlemen, to the Trades and Laboue
Congress. I have before me iiow a copy of
the Gazette of this xnorning, in which it is
stated that a branch of this Congress, the
Canadian Railway Brotberhood, have followed
in the path of the Trades and Labour Congress in their pdilgrimage to Ottawa and have
a9ked the Prime Minister to be good enougb
to remove this drag on the wbeels of progress.
I need not do more, honourable gentlemen,
than point out that the very same people
wbo are now de'manding the i emoval of the
Senate are the people who are asking for
legisiation to fix the scale of wages, the
control of labour contract.a, unemployment
insurance, and old age pensions. 0f course,
I understand that people holding such views
would desire the removal of the Senate. How
could they ever expect ta get th's country to
pass sucb legisiat.ion, which. is now hanapering a part of Europe, and Great Brtitain in
particular, so long as this House remains in
existence? No, they know it, and therefore,
not being able to surmount the obstacle, they
want to blow it out of the way. The Government bas heard the complaints from the West,
it bas heard the requcsas from the Labour
Unions, and it has, made these requests and
these complaints its own. Those who should
give an example in the land of respect for the
Constitution are to-day trailing behind others
who have either little interest in the Constitution of our country or wbo for their
own private ends will not hesitate a moment
to set it aside. ls not that a very serious
state of affairs? That, honourable gentlemen, is the point whiicb in rny opinion we
must bear in mmnd. Those responsible for
the education of the masses art- asking for
the removal of one of the main guarantees
given by Canfederation.
Men pass tbrough here rapidly. They ileave
in many cases a happy memory, but .they are
gone. Nevertbeless this House drns stood since
Confederation, and it is meant to stand very
mudb longer. It bas a trust Vo perform, and
every man in this Obamn'ber is a pillar of ilbat
trust, whatever hie own opinions may be. Is
it noV a regrettable tbing, honourable gentlemen, to see a man like the Prime Minister
carried away by the demands of a littIe section o4f the country; coming here after im-

63

prudent speeches and tbinking himself obli.ged
to implement bis promises by legislation whiob
may mean untold troubles in the future?
Yes, you may have -a conference with the
Provinces; you may bave ail the deliberations
you like, it is true; -but be careful and reznember the minority in my Province which bas
so much at etake. Why should the people
be educated to rush upon the Constitution Vo
tear it down? For tihat is ýwbat it means.
That, bonourable gentlemen, is a serious crime
agaînst the Constitution, a crime wbicb the
Government bas no right to comimit. And
may I be permnitted to say this--I do not
want to be personal-that those who represent
my Province in tbe Commons have no right
to participate in sucb action, because it is an
attack upon the fortress wberein, upon entering
Cbnfederation, we bave depoeited our most
sacred right, that of remainiug wbat we are.
1 amn sorry if I bave been carried a little
farther tban I întended; but perhapa I shaîl
be forgiven if I trespass on your âime a little

furtlher, to read to you two

very i'llusninating

extracte, hoping and trusting that my bionouraible friends across the House will not
f orget theni. We are flot far -from a general
election. It may appear to bie skillful for the
time, being to say to the labouring classeor that smaîl portion of thbe labouring classes
which bas spoken--or -to tbe West-or tbat
smaîl portion of the West which is complaining: "We are going adter the Senate now.
Help us to come back to power, and tiben
the Huse of Commons will be in supreme
contraI. The bouse of Lords, that reactionary
body tibat has dragged after us sinee the time
of Confederatic>n, will exist no more. We will
assume the responsibility of undernining Confederation, if necessary, àn order to do your
wisbes and to obey your commanda."
But these gentlemen ought to reflect and
remember that, after aIl, few countries have
a past equal to, ours. Tbey ouglit to refleet
tha;t progress, peace, and quietness bave attended this country. Tbey ought to reflecit
that people bave come to us from Europe,
from quartera Where tbey could find neitiber
continuous peace nor justice. Why bave they
come ta us? Recause, honourable gentlemen,
the wisdom of our forefathers laid deep and
firm the foundation ai a Conifederation in
wbicb these people are glad to join. It ougbt
to be remembered that because of tbe ~Wsom.

Honourable gentlemen opposite do not need
Here is what Sir
to take my word for it.
Wilfrid Laurier had to say on Confederation
and how it should be dealt with by the
statesmen of Canada. In 1907, in noving
"that an Address be presented to His Majesty
for an amendrment to British North America
Act," by which the subsides to the provinces
should be increased, he said:
It is now more than forty years since the varionus
Conferences took place which led to the foundation
of the Canadian Confederation, and it is now exactly
forty years since the Imperial Parliament, giving effect
to the resolutions which were adopted at the Quebec
Con'ference, passed the British North America Act,
which within its four corners contains the charter
of the Dominion's rights, privileges and liberties. It
is undoubtedly a matter of legitimate gratification and
pardonable pride for us Canadians that nearly half a
century bas elapsed before any necessity bas arisen
for substantial alterations in the enactments of the

that we have been more fortunate than our neighbors,
for the ink was scarcely dry upon the Act of Union
before new Articles were added to it, and alosst simultaneously with the Act of Union ten Amendiments had
been added to the original instrument.
Two more
were added soon afterwards, and there were also three
additional aiediliiints added at a subsequent period
as a result of the great Civil War, which took place
soie eigity years after the original contract was made.

And this, honourable gentlemen, is what the
Right Honourable Sir George Foster, who now
adorns this Chamber, said in answer to Sir
Wilfrid Laurier on the same subject:

Constitution is once forsssd it must be like steel and

agrse with the honourable gentleman (Sir Wilfrid
Laurier), and I think I am in agreement vith the
iajority of the members of this House when I say
that the Constitution under whicl different peoples
agreed at a certain time to bind themseIves to live
their national livs together under a Federal compact,
ought to be very respectfully treated, and that there
ouglt to be more than a common reason for disturbing that Constitution.
There may even be evils
anti weaknesses developed, but on the other hand, it
souetimnes is a question of pretty even balances. and
wliether it is not better te endure these evils, and to
nake head agasst the difficulties, rather than to tend
towards frequent change, and thereby to graduial takine
away from the sacredness and the inviolability of
the Constitution and the compact, and making them
mere matter of agreement, that is liable to be changed
from the stress of party or political or financial or
other exigencies.

Honourable gentleHon. L. O. DAVID:
men, I rise to say only half of what I
I think it proper
originally intended to say.
to commence by saying that I approve of
everything that has been so well said by both
of the leaders in this House with regard to the
speeches made by the honourable the mover
(Hon. Mr. Robinson) and the seconder (Hon.
I think proper
Mr. Tessier) of the Address.
also to say that I share completely the feelings
of regret which have been expressed as to the
illness and absence of Sir James Lougheed, an
honourable gentleman whose ability and kindly
disposition I have so often appreciated during
the past 25 years. To the honourable the
ex-Minister of Labour (Hon. Mr. Robertson)
I nmay say that I think being choen to replace such a great man as his leader is an

ever, it would be truc, and what I would say
would be sincere.
I will somewhat limit my remarks upon the
question of Senate reform, for several reasons,
one being that if I were to say everything I
intended to say I would repeat a great deal of
what the honourable gentleman from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) bas so well said.
Ionourable members of this House know that
during the last twenty-five years I have
brought the question of Senate reforra before the House on several occasions; and on
those occasions miany good speeches were
made, one of which I particularly remember
by the Honourable Sir George Ross; but no
vote was taken on the question, because after
having heard what was said by some of the

FEBRUARY 12, 1925
hionourable menibers of thi.s Huse I came to
the conclusion that the opinion was that it
was better to, leave things as tbey were, and
that any change w'ould perbape be )more
objectionable thaxj the present systemf.
I
have always expressed the same view. I have
always said, and will continue to say up to,
the la.st moment of my life, that any refermi
the effent of which would be to abo1ish the
Senate or curtail its powers, and to prevent
it f romn amending or annulling
legisiation
passed by the bouse of Commons, would be
contrary to the spirit and good working of our
Constitution, te the intentions and declarations
of its founders, to the mission which they
wanted it to fulfil, and would be a violation
of the pact or contract agreed to by the
different Provinces when they consented to
form themselves into a Confederation.
The honourable member from Montarville
has shown that the filon. Sir John A. 'Macdonald was of the opinion that the Senate
had been instituted to proteet the minorities
and the autonomy of the differént provinces.
There is no doubt that the Fathers of Confederation wanted to create a politicai body
strong enough and incependent enough to
revise and ametnd, and even reject. any legislation f00 easily or hastily adopted by the
bouse of Commons, often under the pressure
of influences more or less detrimental to the
general interests of the country. Their intentions are clearly enunciated in the reports
of the Halifax and Quebec C'onferences, and
in the speeches made in both bouses. 1 liad
intended to quote some of the speeches made
at the time by the Fathers of Confederation;
but I do flot think it is neressary te do so
now. When Confederation w'as established
I was a young man. It may net be thought
that I was very young, but I was, and aithough young, I was taking part ~n the
pelitical aiffairs of the day, especially the
question of Confederation. I attended ail the
a.ssemblies held at the time, and heard Sir
George Etienne Cartier proclaim, in his loud
voice, in order to induce the French Canadians to accept the article of the Constitution
which condemned t.he province of Quebec
neyer to have more than 65 members: "Do
net f ear: there will be a guarantee, a compensa.tion, in the fact that the Province of
Quebec will he represented in the Senate by
one-third of its members."l And that argument, that explanation, was repeated by al
the newspapers who advocated the pollicy of
Sir George Etienne Cartier. The Senate was
to be constiituted in such a way as te, offer a
guarantee to the minorities and for the autonomy of the provinces.
That guarantee,
it is true, has been greatly reduced by the

S-5

ltfflSED

65

introduction in the Senate of the representatives of the Northwest. The Fathers of Confederation do flot seemn te have foreseen the
developments of the Northwest; te have considered the effects of its representatien when
it would have more population than the rest
of the country; and, in view of the declarations of Cartier, it is flot certain that hie
would have accepted the new Constitution
if hie had foreseen what is now taking place.
At ail events, it cannot be denied that the
establishment of a Senate having the power
te, modify and even rel ect legislation passed
by the bouse of Commons was one of the
essential conditions of the pact which. took
place' between the old provinces, and that
consequently no modification of that pact
should lie adc'pted without consultation with
and the consent of each of them.
It is needless to say that the consent of the
Senate would aise be required and to add
that it weuld not probably be disposed to be
deprived cf its powers, to assent to its mutilation or death. The consent cf the Imperial
Parliament would also be required. And before ahl those consents are ehtained, that cf
the Senate especially, much water wili pass
under the Ottawa bridge. So that the Prime
Minister wilýl have reason te say that it is not
his fault if fie was uinableîto fuliil lis promises
-thaï, it was the fauit cf the Senate. It will
flot be the first time that Government will
try to save themrselves by making cf the
Senate a boue emissaire, or a scapegoat, and
I am surprised that they thought it opportune
te deprive themselves of that resource. But
the Prime Minister is not on a bed cf roses,
and hie bas given proof -of abiiity in controhiing the darigerous elements whieh threaten al]
the tinie te degtroy bis governimcnt.
Now, te aIl the reasens given by the Fathers

cf the Senate and the granting te At ef the
powers wh*ich it possesses, we must add that
the extension cf pepular suffrage and its effect
upon the character of the composition cf Iower
chambers renders more necessary than ever
the establishment cf upper ohambers. It cannet be denied that in Canada, as everywhere
else chambers elected hy groupe and elements
are ir ciined te adopt legislation wbicb. requires

men do net foresee the consequences of the

erous demagogues who want to upset the
fundemental principles of society. History
teaches that such is generally the result of the
most beneficial popular movements, and we
have now striking and sad examples of that
fact, in Russia, and even in England.
Speaking of the labouring classes who are
opposed to the Senate and want its abolition,
as the honourable member from Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) has just said, bas the
Senate opposed just legislation in favour of
the labouring classes? What have we refused
to do that was reasonable and just? And
where is the man who would refuse in future
to do what he thought to be in the interests
of the labouring classes, provided it were not
against the interests of all other classes?
The example of England is invoked to
justify the projected change. But it must
not he overlooked that the constitution and
mission of our Senate is very different from
that of the House of Lords. The House of
Lords does not exist like the Canadian Senate
in virtue of a written Constitution and of a
special pact agreed to by the different provinces for a special object in order, as the
honourable gentleman from Montarville (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien) bas just stated, to protect
the autonomy and the rights of those provinces and of the minorities. And the majority
of tlhe Lords, composed in great part of
hereditary members, of great proprietors of
immense domains, of men proud of their
ancestral traditions, is not ceonsidered favourable to the reforms required by modern progress, by the needs of our time; while our
Senate is really as the honourable member
from Montarville bas said, as democratic as
the House of Commons, composed in great
part of men who have been members of that
House, and consequently have been subject
to popular suffrage, have remained in contact
with -the people, and have no special privileges and interests to protect. There is not
then, the same reason to fear the influence of
their political and social ideas. And let us
wait. I may not see it, but you honourable
members who are still young will ee it: you
will sec that before long England will regret
having curtailed the powers of the House of
Lords.
At all events, I repeat that our Senate bas
been established in virtue of a special contract which cannot be modified without its
consent and that of eaoh of the Provinces
which have been parties to that contraot. And
that consent will not, I am sure, ever be ohtained.
And why all this agitation against the Sena-te? Only because it has judged proper, in
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

the interest of the country, to save 'millions
of dollars required for railway branches the
construction of whioh was not urgent, and
because it had not the information which it
wanted to justify so great an expenditure at
a time when economy was considered necessary, was required by public opinion, and
was advocated by the Government itself. As
the fact that the Senate bas done what it has
de.emed to be in tihe interest of the country
cannot be denied, it -is difficult to understand
that its conduct in ithis instance can be used
as an argument for its abolition or the curtailing of its powers. On the contrary, it is
a reason for praising the Senate for having
been independent enough to do what the interests of the country required. It was not
inspired by partizan motives, since many
liberals-I know one of them, anyhow-voted
with the Conservatives on that question.
If the Senate were to be deprived of the
power of checking a measure which it thinks
dangerous and detrimental to the general interest of the country, it had rather be abolished. because it could not fulifil the mission
for which it was established.
I think. honourable gentlemen, I have said
enough for the present on this question, which
naturally requires great development. The
honourable member for Montarville (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien) bas spoken so well and bas said
so much about it that I do not think it is
neoessary for me to continue on this line.
Now, a few words on some other matters.
The members of the Government have reason to congratulate themselves upon the fact
that the balance of trade is in our favour and
that our exportations exceed considerably our
importations. This shows that our trade is
prosperous; but we must not forget that the
greater part of that balance consists in our
natural products, wheat and lumber especially.
But that element of prosperity is temporary,
accidental and may be in great part upset by
bad barvests. And, moreover, would not the
country be more prosperous if industry were
more prosperous, employed more men and
gave to the different classes of our population
more money to buy its products-in other
words, increased their purchasing power.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would point
out to my honourable friend that our exports
of manufactured goods have increased considerably over the preceding year.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Yes, but what does the
bonourable gentleman say of the imports of
manufactured goods from England and the
United States, which create so dangerous a
competition for our products?

FEBRUARY 12,1l925
But I will flot say more on tihat subi ect
until we have ail the information which 1
hope will be given on lt. I will content myself with reminding the honourable members
of this House that lest year I made a motioni
on the question of preferenOe and tried to
show that the importation of foreign goods
was very detrimental to some cf our industries,
especially boot and shoe manufacturing, iron
and woollen goods. Well, statisties which
have been published lately show that my
assertion was well founded. But, as I -have
just stated, I will wait for further information
before saying anything more on that question.
However, I trust that if the manufacturera,
especially those -at the head of the industries
I have just mentioned, corne before the Government, and if statistica show clearly th&t
they are suffering froM the compétition Of
foreign goods, the Government will do what
their interests and the interests of the country
require. I cannot believe tha~t the Government would refuse to do for those industries
what is absolutely necessery.
I intended dealing also with the question
of our imxnixture in European Inatters and
quarrels; but, as this question will come before the House when the Protocol is discussed,
I will reserve my remarks until 'then. I will
content myseif with recalling that two years
ago I expressed the feer that our participation
in the déliberations of the League of Nations
might be a cause of friction and verious complications in our relations with England and
the jn-ited States. I think I shall be able to
show alsa that my f ear was well founded, but
I will flot say more for the present.
1 wish only to enswer certain remarks made
by English newspapers and by somes gentlemen in Montreal tending to show that our
advocacy of a Canadien policy wes exaggerated.
I admit that the French Canadiens are inclined to consider Canadien interests 'before
ail others. It is a feeling which can b<every
easily explained. Honourable gentlemen, the
French Canadians have more reason than any
other people to be attached to Canada, especially those who came late into this country.
We are the heirs, the descendants, of the
great men who laboured sa bard, suffered 50
much, and shed their blood for the introduction into this country of Christian civilization. Fram one end of Canada to the other,
from. the Atlantic to the Pacifie, from the
icy waters of the Hudson Bay to the flowery
shores of the Mississippi, they have left testimoniels cf their heroism. We owe whatever
we have of prosperity te the existence cf
these men. The stones of our mountains,
the waters of aur rivera, the trees of aur

67

forests, sing their praises, and those who have
reacd our history, especially the history of
the foundation cf Montreal, must admit that
naturally we feel bound te preserve that
glorious heritage which was transmitted. to
us, and to devote all our energy to the happiness and prosperity of a country for which
our ancestors made such sacrifices.
Now, honourable gentlemen, much ia said
of the Bonne Entente-mutuel understanding. People come in great numbers from the
Province cf Ontario te the Province of Quebec in order te create a good feeling hatween
the two races. There are certain questions
which are the cause cf division, which I will
mention later on, and which will remnain the
cause of division until they are removed fromn
Confederation. The feet is that, whether we
are cf French or of Anglo-Saxon enigin, we
must be proud of aur enigin, proud of the
achievements cf our ancestors, of the great
thinga done ini Europe and throughout the
world by England andi France; and we in
America, especially in Canada, must endeavour ta de what they have done elsewhere.
Se we must have the samne object in view
in erder te make Canada a happy home for
our children and for the millions of people
who are coming te live on our shores, and
who will continue ta come, particularly if
they have reason te hope that here they will
net be subjeet ta the calaniities and the
troubles which affliet the European world.
Wben I think of the elements cf progreas
and prosperity which Canada possesses, I'cannet understend or approve a policy which
would injure its glorious destiny. Tha destinies cf a country founded and developed by
the two greatest nations cf the world cannot
but be bnilliant and glorieus, previded the
people déevote aIl their activities and energy
te the development cf its natural resources.
My conclusion is that the heat way of
doing our duty towards England and Canada
and te premete between the different races
and provinces cf Canada the unity which is
se much spoken of, is ta adeopt a true Canadien policy having for its special object the
welfare and happiness of Canada and the cane
of its future and its destiny. We must net
forget that in the fneming of aur political,
international, and economie policy we must
take into consideration the feet that we are
living in Amenica and nat in Europe, and thet
we have as aur neighbour one of the greatest
nations cf the world, a nation thet supplies
us with almoat alI the capital we require to
develop our naturel resources, and with whom
we must live in peace and harmony in the
interest even cf England. Neither must we
forget thet aur position in Americe is very

The
point referred to by tbe honourable leader a

In 1890 only 6 pur cent of our exports were
manufactured goods.
In 1923 manufactured
goods reprusented 40 per cent of the total
value of our uxports, and thure was in addition
something like 16 per cent of goods duscribed
as partly manufactured.

Hon. Mr. GORDON: May I ask the honourable gentleman a quesqtion-whether hie
would prefer to have a tariff commission appoin.ted, or a good, stiff tariff put on immediately?
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: It would be infiný,tely preferable to have a tarif[ commission,
because I think that would he a more permanent method and more closely allied to the
needs af the country, w'hich have changed
from time ta time, as the country progressed,
ind ivhich will change again as it continues to

country informed. It would appeai to their
cammon senee, to their patriotism, to their de-sire to be a fully equipped nation in every
respect. We have established our universities,
not because c'ur children couid not go away
and obtain an education elsewhere, but because we want to be a real nation, flot out
rff from the rest of the world, but seif-sustaining and equipped with ail that a nation with
ambition and high standards should have.
On that ground 1 believe that the people of
Canadla desire ta hâve industries established

the tariffs imposed by aur neiglibours ta the
aouth, this cannot be done without a policy
which pravides protection. It would be justified by the results abtained in the country.

been almost complete stagnation for the last
six manths, both in the steel works and in
the coal trade, which has been very poor.
The situation there has been so seriaus, it has
s0 affected the prosperity of the whole provin-ce of Nova Seatia, that a deput.ation came
ta, the Government here a few weeks ago. It
represented the Allied Boards of Trade and the
Govemnment of Nova Scatia. The Premier af
Nova Scatia read the whole -or part of an
editoriai appearing in a paper which is ordinarily in opposition to him, and he said, "I
eau subseribe ta that." Such harmony on a
question of that kind has, I th.ink, neyer bel are

deputation were in a position to point out ta
the Government that the rate of duty ad
valiorem an coal hlad sunk from, the position
af being somewhat on *a parity wit h other
duties wben it was ixnposed, down ta the
level af about one-half or one-third; and the
,decrease was about the sanie on steel.
Fur-thermore, improvements in the art ai
combustion have created a different situation
with regard to slack coal. At the time it
was made free it was a drug on the market.
In those days we practically gave it away at
Sydney at 15 cents a ton. It was a bother:
you had -ta get rid ai it. Representations were
made that it would be no harm ta allow thst

Of1 course, we could nat send it from Cape

The fuel value of the fresh-mined siack is taday very littie below the value ai run-ofmine coal.
There is stili another factor. The warks in
Ca.pe Breton are suffering from the oompetition of steel works in Belgium and other
continental countries with depreciated currency. There is provision only for certain ad
valorem duties an goods coming from certain
countries. Sufficient recognition is not given
ta the fact that a country Ilike ours has practica.lly a goid standard, whereas the currencY
in countries like those others is at about onequarter of the gold standard. Evezi if one's
theory be as near to act-ual free trade as it
is possible to attain, one muet admit that com,petitîin from -those countries whose currency
is depreciated is absolutely unfair, and I trust
that the Government will provide a remedy.

n itb in a more permanent way and more satisfactorily to the people of this country, through
a commission.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable gentlemen. 1 bave listened thjs afternoon with a
great deal of interest to the remarks that
have been on the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne, particularly to those
made by tbe gentlemen from Quebec who
spoke of the constitutiona] aspect of any reforrn wbich migbit bo suggested or proposed
of this body of whicb we are members. I
was very glad indeed to hear the discussion
along that line, and to get the information
brougbt out by the honourable gentlemen.
Personally, however, 1 rnay say that 1 have
neyer yet taken the matter of Senate reformi
in a very serious way. If I have read correctly the history of Canada since Confederation, and if I follow the various discussions
that have arisen in the other Chamber fromn
time to time, it seems to me that in almost
every instance when there bas been a clamour
for tbe reforrn of tbis Chamber it has arisen
flot from any spirit of democracy but rather
from a spirit of tyranny. Whenever members of tbe other Chamber bave asked for tbe
reform of the Senate it has been becauso they
were flot getting just what tbey wanted. On
the other band, there bas neyer yet, so far
as I know, been any question upon which tbe
people of Canada have given tbeir opinion
at the poils upon wbieh their decisions have
been reversed by this Chamber. Such outbreaks have always been becaur, of one
Chamber resenting criticism or corrections or
restrictions being put upon it by another
Chamber whicb was created at Confederation
for that very purpose.
The two great races of Canada are AngloSaxon and French. Both tbe countries fromn

until it Ivas found to be as great a failýure as
it had been in Great Britain, with the result
that tbey now bave two Chambers, the senior

indicates the nece.ssity of two Cbambers, one

but nevertheless it is tyranny, and it wvould
be very unfortunate if that formi of tyranny

any idea whatever of adopting the systerm of

I arn very much pleased to notice tbc spirit
of optimisim set forth in the Speech froin thie
Throne. I cannot, howce or, agree with thiose
who spoke on that .subject su admirahiv, and
1who in their addres~,es asked us tu hclipx- that

tbe co6st of living, that "even the mo.st rigid

to solve thi.s problem." T-hat paragraph presupposes that the present Government bas

year permitted the larger manufacturera of
inmplemnents to go on; and that, so far as it
went, wus good. They were able to do that,
and why? Because they got the raw materials
in without any duty. What hap'pened, thiough,
to those men who were making the nuts and
boits and various other parte that go into
,ýhe assernbling of agricultural implements for
the larger plants? Nearly ail of them are
working part turne or are closed up. For the
information of rny honourahie friend, and
others who want Vo know, I expected to have
to-day the figures as Vo the actual number of
plants in Canada which for that and one or
two other reasons have been closed, and the
number that have been put out of business.
I shall have the details in rny hands withia
a day or two and shall be pleased Vo subinit
them then, but, in round numbers, 1,100 industries in Canada have had their output
reduced by three-quarters in the last twelve
months because of the changes mad~e in the
tariff by the present Governinent at the last
Session of Parliament. 1 arn having computed also the number of employees affected,
and shail be glad Vo give, laVer on, noV only
the exact number of factories closed, and the
exact number of factories that have been put
on one-haîf or one-quarter tirne, but aleo the
number cf employees thrown ouit of employment by reason of the changes to which I
have referred.
There is anotiher interesting suggestion in
the Speech from the Throne, and it relates
Vo the matter of transportation. I arn very
much interested in transportation because,
Canada having entered s0 lýargely into public
ownership, transportation is one of the most
vital problems with which this country has
Vo contend. It will be a good thing, indeed,
if this Governrnent can devise some means
whereby transportation charges or the cost
of transportation in Canada can be reduced.
Perha,ps I.can give you a hornely illustration of what I mean by that. The farming
industry of this, country is lsnguishing, just
like our other industries. Manufacturing wilil
flot langtuh witthout dieastrous effect on farming, and transportation bas had a very material bearing on both. The lumber induatry
of this country also is languishing. It is
true that the average price of luinher for the
last three years has been very muoh higher
than it was for any thfree years previous to
the 'war. We will say it la on the average
34.50 Vo 35 a thousand more. It may be
wondered why the lumber operators could net
make mioney. The fact of the matter is that

75

for the past three years, at least, the lumber
operatiors of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick
-and I thin< the samie applies Vo the province
of Quebec--have noV made a cent. Those
who operated on iCrown Lande or Government
leaseholds wcre in most cases unable to earn
their stusnpage. Those lumnbermen who operated on private lands--and a Vo those I
know whereof 1 speak, because I arn one of
them-have received in the last, Vhree years
an average price ~wich has enabled them Vo
psy tihe cost of operation, of cutting their
luanber off their own land, and have not
had one cent for the standing trees. It is
a fair otaternent that so f ar as the province
of New Brunswick is concerned, the two or
three hundred million feet of lumber that bas
gone out of tihat province in three years has
been an aboolute dead loss -of raw material.
I dourbt that the proceeds frorn the sale of that
lumler have paid the cost of getting it to
the mnille, the cost of milling it and of getting
it loaded on the cars. 1 do noVt blanne tihis
Governnent for that; I amn simply calling
attention Vo the unfortunate condition that
exista; but if this Goverrnment cau do apything to lessen tihe cost of transportation it
will very materially help Vo improve that
situation.
For instance, it nostis to-day approximatcly
$9 a tihousand Vo transport lumber fromn a
point in New Brunswick, say, Vo Toronto, and
it coste about $8 a th-ousand, on the average,
from the saine point in New BrunsVo geV 1V
wick: Vo Boston. The McAdoo award shot
the railway rates ahl to pieces. Prior Vo tihat
it cost 33.50 a thousand less in one instance
and nearly $4 a thousand less in another instance Vo geV luanber to those respective
points. Just tSat difference in transportation
is an enormous profit'. One-half of that difference is a fair profit Vo the lumnbermen. By
taking soine steps Vo lower the co«t of transportation of natural products, or of ail products, this Governanent enu confer a great
benefit -on Canada.
I have instanced lumber. Let me Vake
another conminodity, one in which the fariner
is particuiariy interested. I come froin a
grat hay-growing counitry. The export of hay
froin my section, which is a email one, amounts
Vo about 15,000 tons a year. A few years
ago the cost per ton Vo ship tihat hay Vo
one of its naturaa markets, Sydney, was
$3.40. To-day it case 36.80, if I remember
ariFht, te send it Vo the saime place. The
farmner to-day, in that particular section, is
getting $9 for hie hay, loose. His labour couta
a great deai more than formerly. Farming
land down there is worth on tihe aveinge about
$110 Vo $125 an acre, and it nosts on the

76

SENATE

average $3 a ton to produce that hay. The
resuit is that tthe fariner is getting nothing
out of it. If you oould give hum the diffarence in cast of transport'ation between the oid
rate and the present rate on hay, hc would
-have at 1east a reasonaýble margin of profit.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Where is that difference tu corne frain? Somebody mnust pay it.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Well, instaad of giving
a subsidy to a graup of steamships to carry
our products across the Atlantic, for H-eavan's
sake ]et us have traffic in our own country
carried at a reasonable rate.
The saie remarks apply to potatoes. The
farmars *have been getting 32 to 40 cents a
bushel this year, and if they had a reduction
of froin 5 to 7 cents par bushel in freight
it would enable thein to obtain a fair profit.
I give you these figures simply ta show to a
slight degrae how a reduction or control of
transportation costs inight work out
My honourabie friand acroýss the way (Hon.
Mr. Belcourt) aÊks how the Governinent is
going ta d.o this. I will tell you ana thing:
if they would anly fallow the suggestion I
put forth Iast year they would save anough
monay on the Canadian National Railways
alone. And, inind you, I consider that the
Goveroment are responsible for the Canadian

this country ought ta control the destinies of
the different branches of the cauntry's organization. If they hftd donc that they would

no wish to belittle 'Sir Henry Thornton, haCause I believe ha is a good railway man. I
do think, though, that just as the haad of
any business kaeps control of those who are in
his employ and does not let thein run away
with freak ideas, --- should the Governinent
of this country keep itself a ýlittie more
closaly in touch with the railway management
and sea that it is not carried away with such
ideas. What in the world do the people of
Canada want to pay for radio broadcasting by
the National Railways? Yat, I understand,
Hon. Mr. BLACK.

wa have now in Canada six radio stations
oparatad by the Canadian National and costing approximately $500,000. I say approximataly; some of them cost $90.000, some
$7fl,000f-there are differant amounts. but
the investinent amounts approxirnately to
$500000; and the annual expanditure for upkaap of those radio stations is about $200,000,
and at 5 par cent the interest on the investment is $25,000 a year.
There you hava
$225,000 a vaar loaded o.t the people of
Canada in their taxes-why? If must ha in
ordar to advertise the Prasident or some of thc
employeasQ of the Canadian National Railways.
It does not cheapen your railvay ratas. 1
hava heen on trains wliere the radio wvas in
operation, and I could not sit down quietly
and raad or ta]k. I wvould have preferrad no'
to have ir, and I ventura to say that 50 or 75
par cent of the travelling public do not want
to, hava this thing yowling in their aars, but
want -to raad. or sinoka. or chat with their
friands or do business. What is tha purpose
of it? It is to anable certain persons to broadcast thair views. It is the greatest advertising
sehemne I ever head of. and it js not worth ona
cent to the people of Canada. It wis neyer
authorized by tha taxpayers of this country
and thay would ha very much better satisfied,
honourablo gentleman, if that $225,000 a výear
had been takan off the cost of transportation
an aven ana article, rather than spent on the
transportation of wind across the Continent of
North America.
But that is not alI. If you go out to the
City of Winnipeg you will -e a big electrie
sign that cost the taxpayars of this country
$2,000 to put thare, and whan it was erected
it advartisaed something that did nat happen,
or happened for only a few diys. We thought,
in our wisdom, that it would ha a good thing
to have a very fast train bctwean Winnipeg
and Toronto. Soma of us ti.aught we ought
ta put the C.P.R. out of business by ru-nîng
a faster train than they could run; sa w~e had
a train frain Winnipeg to, Toronto which was
a few hours quieker than the C.P.R. train,
and we put up this magnifrent electrie sign
at a cost of $2,000, which Came out 'of aur
pockets.
After a few days the Canadian
National found that thay could not verY well
run that train, and they cancelled it-taok
it off; but the sign is still thera. It cast us
$2,000 ta put the sign n, and how much
money did it cost the peaple of Canada ta
run that fraak train for thrce or four days,
ta change the turne tablea nd have new
schedules printed and do ail those other
things that go with a change in the time af
a through train? Everybody knows it is ex-

pensive. That experiment bas cost the people
of this country a good many thousand dollars.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The C.P.R. did
the samne thing, did it nlot?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BLACK.: Not until they were
forced into it by the Canadian National system.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: There you are.
It is competition.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Then the wiser heads
got together and decided that it was foolish.
Let me ask the honourable gentleman, does
he justify competition to kili, between the
railroads of our country? Does hie jugtify
that?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No; I am n ft trying te justify that.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: That is what I would
like to know. Where will you find anyone
who would justify such competition? I have
nlot one cent of interest in the C.P.R., but
I want to tell you. honourable gentlemen, it
is criminal to have our Canadion National
Railways go into direct competition to kili
the Canadian Paoific Railway. We bave these
two roads, here. Let us keep them. Canadian money is invested in both. The people
of this Dominion have more money in the
C.P.R. than have the C.P.R. directors themselves, because we gave themn land and we
gave them subsidies, and the moiey ail cornes
fromn our pockets. And we, after ail, are
potential owners of these two roads and it is
to the inýtereâts of the residents of Canada
to see that both prosper. Natural-ly it is in
the interests of the people of this country to
sce that the Canadian National Railways get
as fair a share and as fair a show as the
Canadian Pacifie Railway, but it is against
the best interests of Canada to build lines
that will take away business frorn the O.P.R.,
simply for the sake of taking it away, as was
proposed in New Brunswick last year. It is
likewise against the interests of -the people
of this country to have a freak traen operated
from Ottawa to Montreal, or froin WYinnipeg
to Toronto, or anywhere else, simply for the
purpose of taking away business from the
other road, w'hich, after ail, is a Canadian
road. That is not good business policy. You
would neyer see two business bouqes do it.
My friend here and I may bie engaged in the
samne business; we will do our utmogt to
build up our business to the point at which
it will pay the most, but if we have comnmon sense and do flot want to go into
bankruptey we will not begin to eut rates

77

in order to take away business from each
other. That is not common sense, but that
is the sort of thing that, 1 ani afraid, the
Canadian Government R.ailway Management
is doin-g in some instances, and that is why
I say that a very strong guard shouId be put
upon the Management by the Government
of the day, ivhoever or whatev'er they may
be.
There is another thing that I am told, and
there is evidence of its correctnoss, namely,
that the presenit Management proposes to
expend in the city of Montreal about
$50,0O0,000. It is a fact that the present
Management have b-ought, or are at present
engaging for, blocks of land in the city of
Montreal, and iook forward to er:gaging for
stili more. It is true that Bonaventure
Station, in the city of Montreal, is flot a
good station; that it is neot as fine as the
station owned by the C.P.R. It is also true
that, just as soon as the finances of the
country will warrant it, the Government or
the Canadian National Railways may be
justified in making a reasonableý expenditure
in the city of Montreal, but 1 for one say
that this Government or the Raiiway Board
are net justified in buying in that city today lands that are not nece.%ary for immediate use, or in proposing the erection of
an enormous building that will outshine that
o~fthe C.P.R. in Montreai, when the building
which we have will serve the needs -of the
present traffie. Capital expenditure for show,
or capital expenditture for better station
accommodation, in unjustifiable unless it will
bxing direct financial returns, or unléss the
Company or the Government have more
money in their coffers than is needed for
ordinary purposes-unless they have so large
a revenue that they can afford to build
ornaments such as those to which I referred.
The spirit which prompts the proposed expenditure of f50,OOOOCO or thereabouts in
Montreal was the saine spirit that brought
about the purchase of a corner on King Street,
in Toronto, opposite the C.P.R. ticket office.
In the city of Toronto we h'.ve a magnificent
terminal which is not used, because of somes
disagreement between the Government and
the city of Toronto, with which I am not
conversant; but only a few steps away fromn
the new terminal they spent an enormous
amount of money to buy a corner upon which
it is intended to ereet a new building-why?
Not because it was needed any more than
a fifth wheel to a coach. Not a bit. 1 do
not need to tell honourable gentlemen who
know a little about Toronto that the ticket
office on that particular corner was desired
for any other reason than competitive pur-

poses. That is nlot what the Canadian National is for; not at the present time. The
people of this country are not in the humour
to enter into private fights between the presidents of various railroads, or of railway governing bodies. They want economy, and until
they get economy they will not be satisfied.
This Government will not remain in control,
when they go to the people, if it is their idea
that such expenditures are what the people
of this country want; nor would any other
Government remain in power that thought
and acted along similar lines.
There are just three things that I would
suggest to the honourable leader of tha Government to put above his door so that he
may see them every time he enters. When I
say the leader of the Government I not only
mean the honourable leader of this Chamber,
but the leader of the Government in another
place; and I think it would be well for us
alil to do the same. The three things that are
most important in Canada to-day are these:
first protection; second, transportation; and
third conservation. In those three are contained the whole future destiny of this Dominion of Canada. In everv case where the
tariff in this country has been lowered-snd it
has been lowered by both Governments--we
have seen disaster follow. If free trade were
not merely a theory, but a practice the world
over, I would be a freetrader. There is not
a frec trade nation in the word to-day. Great
Britain is much more protectionist to-day
than is Canada.
The United States, our
neighbour to the south, have the highest wall
of protection ever recorded in the histury of
mankind, so far as written history is available; and it is childish to suppose that we,
living alongside of them, can develon our
industries without protecting ourselves against
their very much greater production and very
much greater manufacturing -bility.
In so far as transportation is concerned,
I have said enough, I think. and other honourable gentlemen who know more about it
have said more. We are perfectly content
to see lower ocean rates, but before we spend
the money of this country to get lower ocean
rates let us in some way ýy to adjust the
rates in this country so that the spirit of
Confederation may be carried out-sa that
the Maritime Provinces may ret that to which
they are entitled, and which belongs to them
under the pact of Confederation; so that the
West and the East may be brought together;
so that those particular sections that are
heavily discriminated againat by transportation charges may have their handicap at least
ameliorated. That can be done, honourable
gentlemen. If the transportation officials and
Hon.

Mr. BLACK.

the Government meet together at a round
table conference, I am satisfied they can evolve
methods whereby that can be done.
It has been said that there is a spirit of
revolt in the Maritime Provinces.
That is
not true.
The people of the Maritime Provinces are just as loyal to this Dominion
as is any other part of Canada.
There is a
time, you know, when a sore foot becomes so
sore that you cannot wear a boot. That time
is rapidly approaching in the Maritime Provinces, and it is the duty of this Government
to sec that that sore is healed before the boot
has to come off.
If the Government, instead
of giving us platitudes, would give us something definite in the way of economy, give
us something definite in the way of lower
transportation charges, and, more essential
still, give us some protection for our industries,
the country would return to normal and there
would be no Maritime question, there would
be no Middle West question, and no extreme
West question, but we would all be once more
a united country.

THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterd'ay further
consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening of the Session and the motion of lion. Mr. Robinson
for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. RUFUS H. POPE. Honourable gentlemen, I observe that the mover and the
seconder of this resolution are flot present;
but 1 desire to pay my tribute ta them for
the ability with which they bave deait with
the very meagre programme that has been
presented in the Speech frorn the Throne.
We have become familiar with the fact
that the Speech from the Throne ronveys
very littile regarding the true condition of the
country, or the proposais thrst the Gçovernment froin time to time may see fit to Iay
before Parliament for consideration. I would
flot say that this was the first instance in
which the programma has not heen very extensive or very comprehiensive. There are,
however, contained in. the Speech fromn the
Throne certain mattcrs that can be made of
very great importance, and that, if flot judiciously carried out, may possibly be very
dangerous ta the welf are of Canada.
On two or three previaus occasions since
this Government came into power 1 have
taken the opportunity ta urge upon them
to adopt somne definite policy, fiscal and otherwise, with reference ta Canada. I assume
that I was looked upon as a partisan. It was
suppose& that because the people with whom
I used to sympathize politically were flot in
power I was desirous of criticizing, rather than
seeing the Government bring forward a programme or policy that would mean advancement and prosperity for this country. I wish
ta say, honourable gentlemen, that that neyer
was rny attitude towards any Government
in power, whether I was a supporter of it or
not. I have been as free a rtic of the party
ta which I belonged as ta the one ta which I
was 'opposed. And to-ci!ay, in view of Canada's position, we must bear in mind the
necessity of doing something of a constructive nature in order that this country may
progress rather than gcù backward; and I think
it is high time that honourable mexnbers of
this Bouse, irrespective, of their party affiliations, should say, with ail the power they
possess, that the Government have neglected
ta play the game nationally end have been
rather playing a game that is purely political.
There is nothing more disastrous tr the
country than that, after an election has taken
place and a particular party has been put
in power, it should continu:e ta play the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

79

hustings game within the Cabinet councils of
Canada rather than the bold national game.
It rests entirely on tle Cabinet and nowhere
else ta assume the responsibility of putting
forward legislation that will redound ta the
benefit of this country. Yet that Cabinet, 1
say again, has become a committee of politicians, and studies matterd ùnly from. the
point of view of the question, what will happen ta them or theirs if they enact certain
legislation for the benefit of this country, if
such legislation happens ta be unpopular with
somne section on which they depend for their
mai ority. That is a great misfortune for
Canada, andr it always will be a great misfortune when such gentlemen as they occupy
the Treasury benches, no matter what their
name màay be, whether Conservative or
Liberal; and I have no hesitation in saying
that that is the position to-day.
Since coming up here about ten days ago
I have had opportunities ta observe. Having
been for many years loafing ar-iund the foot
of the Throne, as I caîl it, it is not very
difficult ior me, on puttng my ear ta the
ground, ta ascertain what is going on, even
inside the secret Council chamber; and my
information, which is ta me satisfactory, warrants me in saying that the Cabinet we have
to-day is lending itself entirely ta political
exigencies rather than ta the requirements of
the Dominion of Canada. It is only necessary ta glance through the programmne whieh
Ris Excellency was -persuaded ta deliver ta
us in order ta ascertain that fact. The Prime
Minister, when hie was visiting the West, took
occasion ta declare in the most emphatic
manner -possible. and as I understand from
the newspapers, amid tremendous applause,
that this honourable body was ta be dispensed with, or, sa altered that its usefulness
would be gone. 0f course, since hie bas returned ta the Cabinet council, in which
various parts of this Canada of ours have
representatives, hie has modifiedi and remodified his plan until hie is almost sulent upon
it.
The honourable member fromn Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) referred yesterday ta
the Province of Quebec, and I assume that
hie spo-ke for the French Canadian element.
Permit me ta say ta that honourable member and ta this honourable HDuse that hie
spoke for the entire province of <Quebec, because the Protestants or English-speaking
minority of that Province stand shoulder ta
shoulder with the mai ority in Quebec in declaring that there shall be no alteration made
in the Constitution of this Senate by any
Government of Can.ada, that will deprive us
of the right of appealing ta this honourable

SENATE
body for protection from any infringement of
the rig-hts of minorities, whether French
More than
Canadian or English-speaking.
that, let me tell my honourable friend who
sits opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), and the
Cabinet to which hie belangs, that they dare
nat do it, notwithstanding all the hoasts made
by the Prime Minister in thaý West. H1e
knew that hie had not much to say ta those
people to areuse enthusiasm, and knew hie
was appealing to people who were to a large
extent comparative strangers in Canada, newcorners who knew little of the circumstances
under which Confederation was brought about
or of the reasons why the Fathers of Confederation, whether representing the mai ority or
the minority in the Canada of that day, conceived-and, I say, rightly so-the idea of
provdding a second chamaber aloof froma the
miglit influence publie
which
exciteuîeît
opinion under certain circumstances. The
wisdom of creating a second rhamber was
discussed from province to province and was
thoroughly understood, and nowhere was it
more insisted upon than in thc Province of
Quebec. Furthermore, honourabie gentlemen,
if Quebec had not been given the guarantee
that this honourable body gives it-if the
people whom I represent in the province of
Quebec had flot been given such a guarantee,
there would have been no Confederation in
1867.
I stated in the city of Montreal the other
day, and I think I was right, that thàs
honourable body was so superior to the intellect of the Right Honourahie the Prime
Minister of Canada that even thougli he felt
disposed to reform the Senate, lie would not
know where ta begin. I have no reason to
alter that remark. I observe that, with regard to my speech at that meeting of ladies
in Notre Dame de Grace, Hon. Mr. Cardin,
Minister of Marine and Fisheries, has stated
that I raised the question of annexation.
I neyer spoke of annexatian upon
Neyer!
that occasion. The only annexatian that I
know af in the Province of Quehec is the
fact that a large number of French Canadians
and English-speaking people have heen forced
ta go aver to the New England States and
are threatening the annexation of thýose States
hy Canadian ciitizens. That is the only annexation that is going an in our part of the
world, and we are not very proud of it
either; and 1 think this Government ought
to consider legislation, fiscal or otherwise,
that wauld stem that tide of migration.
The other day the hanourable leader of this
House presented same figures. I am not going
ta deal with them particularly, because figuree
have been cited over and over again by hionlion. Mr. POPE.

ourable members, and there are sufficient
statisties on Hansard for anybody who desires
to read them. But, while I do flot desire to
discuss figures, permit me to say this. We are
told that 186,000 or 208,000 or some other
number of persons went from Canada to the
United States last year. The number mentioned referred to people who paid $8 a head
and who are reported on the books of the
United States; but that does flot represent ail
the people who went froin Canada to the

themselves are flot more than 50 per cent of
the total number who crossed. I venture to
say that 400,000 people went to the United
States the year before last. The honourable
gentleman says that fewer have gone in the
past year. 1 hope to goodness the honourable
gentleman does not expect that after we have
sent away half a million people in one year
wve can continue to send away that number in
the following year, and that hie does not think
there is no evidence of their policy having
gone wrong just because we did flot send as
many the second year as previously. When
hie speaks of people coming and going between
the two countries, hie refers to what is a
natural condition. People will go from Canada to the United States, and people will
come fromn the United States to Canada. But
what we have to do is to inaugurate such a
policy that the majority will be caming from
the United States to Canada, and not going
fromn Canada to the United States, and until
the Government can adopt such a policy the
figures quoted to us by the honourable gentleinan are of no avail. They in no way represent the financial condition of this country.
They mean only that we do not send hall a
million people to the United States every
year.
The honourablýe gentleman bas spoken about
protection and has quoted certain figures. Let
us consider what bas been the effect of the
Government's policy for some timie back on
the question of agriculture. There has been
formed in the West what is known as the
Progressive Party, who are the masters of this
Government. Rev. Mr. Hoey, whose speech
I have, tells themn when and where they get
off, and says that the people of Eastern Canada who support this Government deserve no
credit for whatever they may have obtained;
that the Government had to give it or go out
of business. This, again, bears out my contention that the present Cabinet is a political
caucus and not a Cabinet of statesmen dealililg with the real requirements of Canada.
The cuînibination formed out in the West have
deimanded a policy for themiselves.

FEBRUARY 13, 1925
In the fit-st place, let it be distinctly understood that for evet-y fat-mer in the West there
are two in Eastern Canada. The interest and
welfare of the farmers of Eastern Canada are
entitIed, flot to more, but to just as much
considet-ation as those of the fat-mers of Western Canada. Whenever any Govet-nient of
this country makes an expenditure, no matter
what Governinent or whcthcr the expenditure
is warranted or flot, the moncy must corne
f rom the taxes of the fat-mers as well as others.
You cannot build a bridge in the city of
Montreal, as you propose doing, without the
fat-mers contri'buting towards the expenditure,
whether it is made through the Administration or under the auspices of the liaboutCommission. The wheat of the West or the products of the East, or both, wîll have to contribute towards the construction of that bridge.
The same is true oif everything oonatructed by
the Government. When the earliest settiers,
as my people were, came into tuhe Eastern
Townships, when my grandfather went there
as an United Empire Loyalist fromn the
United States, there was one log cabin where
the city of Sher-brooke now stands. Whoever
came there at that time came under very
primitive conditions. They took thefr axes
and went to work and made a log cabin
whiich was warm and comfortable, and made
good bat-ns, and took their famil-ies and began
to grow stuif to feed, them I they began to

They had no taxes to pay. There were

help build it. I was very nearly fifty years
of age before I paid my road tax in cash.
It was paid in labour. Our sehools, too, were
primitive and very inexpensive. But we
had to progress and go forward, it was said,
and the raiilroad came. The bridge was bult
across the river; the roads were improved;
valuations of the farina went up;. and from
the soul, which was exhausted to some extent,
hay and products that should have been f cd
on the f&t-m were earried away by the railroads and steasnboats by what is calied improved civilization.

By and by the old man lef t the fat-m.
He either sold the property or arranged
for Mis son to carry on and maintain lim and
the rest of the family. That meant taxation.
The fat-m was no longer a free fat-m. It may
have been sold for 83,000 or 84,000. Interest
upon that money lad to be earned. There
were taxes on selools and roads that had ta
be paid by the famiiy.
By and by-this
story bas been told to me so often that I
bate to repeat it-it was said: "Why, ýhis
young mnfis not getting along as weli as
the old man did."' True, because the soul
had been depleted by the old man, wbo had
proceeded along the original tleory, as is
now being donc in thc West. You have in
thc West some choice spots, like that around
Portage la Prairie, for instance, where there
is a deposit of soil that is the most wouderfui I have ever seen.
Take thc vailcys of
thc St. Lawrence and the Richelieu rive-s.
We lad the same thing. It was wonderful.
There was a wonderfui deposit such as we did
not have on the highlands on which I lived.
Therefore out- soul was exhausted more rapidly.
The tax stili grew; a mortgage was put on; and
the young m-an couid pay neither the taxes nor
the interests on the mortgage, with the x-esult
that the fat-m was vacated.
Now, what had this -man ýto encourage
him during ail this turne?
In 188»-90 the
Government of the day, which was then led
by Sit- John A. Macdonald, for whomn my right
honourabie friend (Right Hon. Sir George E.
Foster) was the Finance Minister, after discussing the question thoroughiy with those
who they thougît knew somnething of the
position, approached thc question on a broad
basis. They did not sit as a political caucus,
and wlen we askcd for an increase of protection on agricuitural products we wcrc given
tht-ce or four cents a pound on meats. That
duty bas reinained the saine; it bas nevebeen increased. If anything, it has been
reduced since it wae put into effect in 1889,
because in ýthose days you could buy ail the
steak you wanted for 10 to 12 cents a pound.
That gave us encouragement; it gave us
heatt and for the fit-at time -in my life I

in 1889, and 'we know what icame of it.

Hon. Mr. POPE: You did xý,ot sign anything? Did you bring it home with you?
You are a true representative of the present
Government: you did flot do anything. 1
congratulate you upon standing on all fours
with the rest of the Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: With the permission of my honourable friend, I may explain that ail that the members of the League
of Nations did was to recommend that document, which represented the best efforts of
men of high standing, to, the serious consideration of their various Covernments.
Hon. Mr. POPE: And you are in cuty
bound to recornmend it -seriously te your
Government? Well, I don't know: I arn
sorry.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And I may say
that it has received the endorsement of such
a prominent Canadian as the R.ight Honcurable Sir Robert Borden.
Hon. Mr. POPE: I was talking about your
Government. There is a good deal of difference between Sir Robert Borcien and your
Government-the difference between daylight
and dark. You do flot like me calling it a
political caucus, so 1 will eall it a Cabinet
of tourists--you have been touring ail over
the world. Mmnd you, I do flot object to that,
because I think that if ever there wu. a
Cabinet that needed broadening out you have
it, and I think it is just as well that you
shoulci be away from home as at home, because then you cannot do any damnage at
home. Do flot think that I arn speaking in
this way because I have a jealous disposition.
I arn not. I hope that we will see some resuits in breadth of view following these
wonderful trips abroad.
I sympathize with the farmers of the West,
for I have grown wheat and raised cattle
and hogs in the West. But they are narrow
in their vision. I appreciate their position,
but I may tell them that they are not going
to gain anything by rapping on the door
that has been closed in their faces by the
United States. They are not going to gain
anything by shipping our wheat into the
United States to be ground up with their
wheat se that the American millers may compete with us in the markets of the world.
It is said that there is a man Iooking after
that. That is what is being done ne matter
who says they are not. My opinion of any
cerapetitor in that -respect is net a very high

one. I would not run the risk of having any
man tamper with my produce, knowing that
hie was geing to compete with me. It was
established 25 or 30 years ago that Manitoba couad produce wonderful wheat, from
which more bread and better bread could be
obtained Vbhan froni any other. We feund at
that time that we had a cinih on the wheat
market of the world. We need not fear
Russia: shie will flot be back fer years in
the wheat market of the wox'ld, and there is
flot the slightest possibility of hier aigain becoming our competitor for years to corne.
Except for a fringe along the United States,
we are the northern wheat-producinýg country,
and the farmers in the West have grown wheat
to the l-imit of 89 bushels to the acre. We
have the greatest wheat fields of the world,
sfar a~swheat available for transportation is
concerned. Personally 1 would like to sce the
Government give serious consideration to the
question of placing an embargo on wheat
going out of this country, and I would like
to see within Canada enough mills to grind
it up and export the fleur, leaving the byproducts for the benefit of our own people.
There were times when we in Eastern
Canada paid $7, $8, $9, $10, $12, $16, $17, $18
and $20 a ton, for bran. To-day we are over
the $30 mark. It is sirnilar with oats and al
cheap grain that is used for the feeding of
stock and in the production of butter. At the
existing prices for such feeds it is impossible
to preduce butter at a price which will compete with the products of southern countries
like Australia and New Zealand, whose butter
is imported into the city of Montreal and sold
in the winter time for 25, 28 or 30 cents a
pound.
I want to say to this honourable body, and
I speak from experience, that no farmer ini
the East can live under these conditions s.nd
pay 100 cents on the dollar. Go to the mnarket
and you will see what happens. The cold
sterage man puts in a certain quantity of
butter. He does not need to store shiploads
of it in order to control the situation. You
corne in frorn the Eastern Townships and you
walk up te hirn and say: "Mr. Armstrong,"
or whatever his narne is-"jI have some butter
to selI: will you buy it?" He offers to pay
me 28 cents a pound. I cannot accept 28
cents, and ask him, "Can you net do better
than that?" "No," hie says, "that ie the
highest price I will pay. I know you a.lways
preduce good butter, and' 1 will pay you 28
cents." When bran costs (>ver $30 a ton and
meal frera $40 to $50 a ton, butter cannot
be produced profitably at 28 cents a Pound.
It absolutely cannet be done. There is ne-

SENATE

S4

thing left for the farmer but to get out and
perhaps go into some slave position. He has
no prospect. If he comes back to the buyer
the next week, he may find that butter has
gone down another cent or two and he has
to sell then because he must seil some time.
There is a bank back home that is after him
every fifteen minutes or so to pay something
or other on a note. He has no facilities for
banking, you understand. There are none, nor
is any mention made·of the subject in the
Speech from the Throne. So, as I say, the
farmer has to sell his butter at the price
offered. It is riot because Australian butter
is the bulk of the supply, but there is enough
of it there to supply the market if that min
does not take 28, 26, or 25 cents a pound.
He has no protection worth anything.
Now, if the farmers of the West had a
national outlook, why did they not come forward and ask us about our position? We
would very willingly and very quickly have
told them. But no, they looked upon us as
people who were building up manufacturing.
We do encourage to a certain extent the
development of industry because it improves
the home market, and the home market is
the best market in the world, I care not what
the other markets may be. Export is allright
for any surplus you have to dispose of, and
for tbat surplus you have to take whatever
price the outside world chooses to give you;
but the best market is the home market, and
the nearer it is to the farmer the better, and
the higher in value is his land, because it is
close to the market that takes the product.
It is the people in the East who laid the
foundation for the West.
Eastern Canada
assumed tremendous obligations in the opening up and development of that Western
country. I believed then, and I believe now,
that we were justified in what we did; but at
the same time I think that we farmers in the
East, who are just as numerous as those in
the West, are entitled to the co-operation of
that ring of gentlemen who are dictating a
lower tariff policy to the Government of the
day. I think it is unfair for them to take
the position that they have taken, that
they alone should say what ought to be the
tariff for agricultural products.
What they
have got out of their proposition has amounted
to very little. Whether they get a binder for
$1 or for $50 less is of no great consequence.
They have now, and they will have for years,
a good market for their wheat.
I do not
say that it will always be at $2, but their
prospects in the wheat market are good if
they do not over produce. If they do, then
it will -be their own fault and nobody else's.
Hon. Mr. POPE.

There is no country in the world that can
compete with them in the quality of wheat,
and if they will only produce the quality that
that part of the country grows, and will not
overdo the thing, they ought to be able to
turn a good profit. There is no reason why
they should overdo their production. They
should not support for one minute a Government that does not lay before them, in the
month of March-next month-tlheexadtworld
situation in the wheat market. We are the
only people who sow wheat in our spring and
reap it in our autumn. All the wheat of
Australia and South America is now maturing,
and in thirty days' time every farmer in
the Dominion of Canada should be able to
know exactly what proportion of the world
supply will be required from Canada, and
should govern himself accordingly. He ou-ght to
have information that will enable him to judge
in what products there will be a shortage.
But no; instead of having a Government that
takes such interest in us we have a political
caucus going on from day to day.
Let us consider now the question of financing the farmer. I want to deal with that
for a few moments.
It is impossible for a
farmer in my part of the country to carry on
business successfully under the present system.
I am told that in some other parts of Canada
things are better; that in some other parts
a better line of credit is given to those engaged in agrieulture. I am glad of it, but
that is not the situation with us.
Eighty
per cent

of the money

deposited

in

the

village banks is transferred to a great centre
like Montreal or Toronto. There was a time
when we could go to our neighbours and
borrow money from them.
If you went to
a neighbour be would ask you, "For how long
do you want it?" If you said, "I want it for
one year," he would say, "Well, you shall have
it."
But the bankers do not say that. If
you are able to get some person to endorse
your note, they may conclude to let you have
the money, but they will ask you, "How
about sixty days, or ninety days?" You say,
"Really, I cannot get rid of my stock in. that
time; I cannot put it on the market." "But,"
you are told, "these are the instructions of
the Head Office."
What does the Head
Office know?
Do you think a head office in
the city of Montreal, or in Toronto, knows
the conditions under which we are labouring?
Do you think that those men who are
involved in high finance care what those
conditions are?
I do not say that I am at
all qualified to dictate to this country, or
this Parliament, what the financial system
should be.
Personally I think it should be

FEBRUARY 13, 1925
in sonie way associated with the banks or trust
companies who are accustomed to lending
money.
People in the township of Sutton, Quebec,
have had to go te institutions in the United
States for accommodation. It i& on-ly a short
distance away. They had to borrow from
trust companies down there--eome on mortgage, and some not-over $200,000 in that
township in the last year, -in order to, keep
themselves alive. That sort af thing .might
mean annexation if they kept at it long
enough. It was net that they were disloyal
te Canada, but they couid nlot get the money
from Vheir own people. I mention that only
as one example of what is going on.
Last year, when the banking system of
Canada was under discussion, I made similar
remarks. I do not say that my word, or -the
word of any honourable merniber of this
House, should be law, but if the Government
cannet in any way refute that contention,
they ought to give it some consideration, no
matter how insignificant may be the person
who gives utterance to it. I thought then
that it was quite sufficient ta extend the bank
charters for one year, and that the bankers of
Canada should consuit with -the farmers of
this countjry and see how nearly they could
agree in formulating another plan, or some
additional plan of hanking, to meet the requirements of agriculture. The farmer requires long-terni credit, as well as short-term.
We ought te copy the banking systems of
the oldrworld -countries of Norway, Denmark
and Germany, or, for that matter, the system
that existed in Russia when it was Russia.
Old-world methods have been copied ta
some extent by the United States of America
in their new loan system for the farmers there.
They have invented nothing new, but have
had sense enough to go over to Europe, as
our people might have donc, and picked out
what has been successful there, in order to
apply it ta the United States of America;
and this helped by millions and hundreds of
millions of dollars the position of the farmer
in the Western United States. In the mame
way we could imprave the condition of bath
Western and Eastern farmers in Canada.
Mark you, the value of land is not governed
altogether by the articles that the land produces. Population governs it to eome extent.
Do you think that if the United. States cf
America had only 25,000,000 people to-day
instead of 110 or 120 million, farma land in
the central and weetern portions of that
country would be as valuable as it is? Nonsense. Therefore the more people we can
keeu in Canada, with fair prospects cf

85

livelihood, the more will the land owned by
the fàrmer increase in value.
A gentleman who was in this city yesterday,
and who is in my opinion cf very high character, and is associated with finance in
England, asked how I would recommend men
in London ta invest their money. I said,
"Are you excluding mines?" He said, "Oh,
yes; I do not mean mines, or speculation cf
any kind; I mean industrials." Let me ask
any honourable member of this Hous, what
could I have recommended ta him? The
Minister af the Interior declared, only the
day before yesterday, in another place, that
he had not given up hope cf lowering the
tariff to a free trade level--or words ta that
effect. Not at ahl; he was still ringing the
death-knell of protection in Canada. What
could I tell my friend? I asked him if he
would subxnit something te me for consideration. He said: "What about pulp and
paper mills, and se, on?" I said: "My dear
friend, as a Canadian I would. like ta se
hundreds of millions of British money came
into Canada ta develop this country. We
need money." What has happened te those
milîs? During the great war there waa a
wonderful demand, and stock was watered
and re-watered by the millions in order to
avoid payments ta the Government. Bonds
were issued for more than the assets. I said:
"The only asset lying hehind those mille is
the forests which they own, which are tributary ta them." Mark you, net the forests
away off in the North, bought fer the sake
of the name "territory," but the timber
tributary ta those maille. I said ta my friend:
"Inspect tha-t timber before you lend a dollar,
and if there is timber enough there ta, run
that mill successfully during the lifetime cf
your obligation, then sit down and see what
you can do; but if there is net timber enough
behind that mili ta run it succesafully under
the conditions, have nothing ta do with it."
Why, honourable gentlemen? Because we are
supplying the United States with ever baif of
their neweprint to-day. We are competing
with ourslves. We have knocked it clown
from S8U and $75 ta 865 a ton. Our factorie
are increasing because they have this watered
stock and this rotten financing that they have
imposed upon themnselves, and the result will
be a coilapse. There are to-day enough mille
for aur forests.
Now, honourable gentlemen, if there had
been a scru-tinizing and protecting organisatian in the Government of Canad'a. looking
after the forests; if we had had a proper organization for the establishment of joint-stock
cornpanies; and if the publie had been pro-

SENATE

tectcd in that re poect and the issuance of
stocks and bonds kept within reasonable
bounds, 1 would not have been unable to
recommend çsuchi bonds to that gentleman. I
told him that the best investment for bis
nioney that 1 know of ivas to put it into vacant
farms in Eastern Canada, partly covered with
forests, because, as 1 said to this gentleman,
there is going to lie a big revival in this
country. We are going to have a new government and a new systemi of protection, and
under that systeni of protection, flrst, of al
our population will rem.î,in at home, and then
we shalh import people fromn abroad. Why
should we bring in immigrants when we cannot keep our own people in Ibhis eountry?
Think of the presenit situation. A family
of ciglit or ten young persona are educated
at home at an expense of a couple of thousand
dollars eacli; or put the figure at $1,000, or
$500, if you pilease. We sec the bri.zhîest intel1ect-1 among our manhood and wcmranhood

have gone to the Un'ted States. Thyý' do not
want arny idiDits down there; they eau provide
enough of those theinselv es. It is oi' brighitest and best that thcy want. Though our
loss in this respect is not suceh a cruel one,
yet, so fer as the developmient of Canada is
eoncerned, it makes no difference whether aur
yonng people have been buried in France or

Hon. C. E. TAINNER: Honourable gentlemen, I have a few observ atians 10 make before tliiý malter is disposed af.
I think it as yesterday or the div before
that I saggested ta my honourable friend the
leader of the Hanse that the statistical
documents ta whieli lie was referring were
nat quiLle a satisfactory evidence af stability
af policy, at ana' rate in regard ta the province from which I came. I referrcd my honourable friend to the fact that the fishing
districts in the province af Nova Scotia had
been very mach depopulated, and my honourable friend, if 1 heard him correctly,

FEBRUARY 13, 1925
suggested that that wouid not have been the
case if we had listened to the caîl of reciprocity.
On that subject, honourabie gentlemen, I
have oniy this to say: that as a Canadian, as
one who has iived in this country ail bis life
and who expects to live in it for the remainder of his life, and who hopes to sec Canada
hecome a great nation, is it not time to call
n9 hait to this business of being dependent
lîpon the United States and bebaving as
though wo were an adjunet to that country?
Cannot we stand on our own feet, or must
wo forevor be groveiiing on our knees begging
for reciprocity? For my part I think it is
time that the Canadian people stood on their
feet and lot our friends and neighbours to th
south understand that. we are standing on our
riglits, and that while we are quite ready to
deal witb themn on a fair and square basis we
feel that wo can build up this country to as
great qn extent as they have buiit theirs, and
cao make it a great nation which will rivai
the United States of America. But we wil
never do that is we continue to keep in the
b;îck of our beads the idea that we cannot
seil our fisb or our coal or that we cannot use
our puipwood, but must look to the United
States to ho our heiper and aid in every contingency.
That. honourabie gentlemen, was not the
mentaiity of my honourabie friend opposite
twenty years ago, or of his then politicai
leader. That was not the mentality of Sir
Wilfrid Laurier in 1903 wben he and my honourabie friend embarked on the railway construction poiicy of that period. The idea of
Sir Wilfrid Laurier and my honourable friend
at that time was that they were going to, make
Canada a great country, an independent counttry commerciaiiy and transportationally.
After he-aring the remarks of my honourable
friend, I thought it wouid be well to turn
back to what the honourable gentleman told
the people of Canada in 1903. I am not
going te, weary the House with a lot of reading. but I desire to give the House this extract from the principles of Sir Wilfrid Laurier
in 1903. These are the words that he uttered
in Parliament at that time:
In the face of this, are.tise 'Canadien Parliament
and people going to stand on theïr rnnhood and place
us in such a position thet et all times of the year,
not onlv by one railway but bY two or mor, we shill
have eccees from Jenuary to December to oui owo
hanbours and be able to seY to our Americen neighbours: "Take off your bonding privilege whenever it
sUits you: we are coxamereiaUly independent?"

And on the samp occasion he said:
This new railway will be another link in thet chain
of 'union. It wilI not only openi territory hitherto

idie andi unprofitable; it will not only force CanadiSn
trade into Canadian channels; it wjll flot only promuote citizenehip between 01d Canada and New Canada;
but it will secure our commercial independence, and it
will forever make us free from bondage of the bonding privilege.

I only want to say, honourable gentlemen-,
that I think these are the principies which
should prevail to-day. Instead of hearing my
honourable friend suggest that if the fishermen
are leaving Nova Scotia it is because we made
a mistake in flot accepting the reciprocity
proposai, I wouid like to have heard him
standing up and reiterating the sentiments
which his honourable leader expressed in 1903.
Just as rapidly ais I can I want to give my
honourabie friend a littie more information.
There is an idea abroad, I believe, that practicaliy ail of the taik that cornes from the
Maritime Provinces emanates from Conservatives-that it is political propaganda. 1I cou-Id
give my honourable friend a great deal more
evidence to the contrary than I propose to
give him, but I amn now going to give him one
or two items which I think will convince every
honourable gentleman bore that it is not partizan propaganda. On this question of the
fishermen of Nova Scotia I happen to have
-the report of an interview given in 1923 by the
Hon., E. H. Armstrong, Premier of Nova Scotia.
Il. is true that he was in favour of reciprocity,
and perhaps he is yet, but I wish to quote a
report of this interview, given in the Montreal
Gazette in Aprii of that year, in which. he
happened to refer to that very subi ect. He
said:
The Fordney Tariff Bill and the high freight rates,
the lack of preferentigl tariff and other oversights.
have so disheartened tihe people of Nova Seotia, New
Brunswick and Prince Edward Island that they feel
that they are symply being left out. Reeiprocity, said
the Premier, would have been a simple thing for
the commercial> expansion and future of the Maritime
Provinces. Ail who know conditions in our part of
the world knoiv this.

I am quoting him in full, as my honourabie
friend wjll see; but I want to observe that
while he stresses reciprocity he also stresses
the importance of freight rates. In another
part of this article he says:
While disrnissing any, ideas of succession however,1 the Premier pointed out that thse people of thse
Maritime Provinces feel keenly that they have not
been fairly treated by the. rest of the Dominion. Tiser
have been made to feel, he maid, that they are and
should remain isolated, more or less forgotten. tolerated
at the best, and not provided for like the more
fortunate provinces to the west.

That is the intimation of the leader of the

mercliants, afler being practically ruined in 1921 and
1922, are beginning to feel ground, under their feet,
since the freight cars are heginning to arrive, but their
outlook is flot any tac sunny.

That is the view given by the Premier of
Nova Scotia, who is, as My honourable friend
knows, a prominent Liberal.
I will read a further statement which was
furnished over his own name by the Premier
of Nova Scotia in the same year to a publication known as the Canadian Grocer. He
wrote this special article on the subject of
Nova Scotia's problems. One of the problems
he refers to is that between Capital and Labour
in the coal mining districts of the Province,
another is the question of freight rates, and
another is the question of the fisheries. I will
read what he says after pointing out the burdensome rates under which the Maritime Provinces have been suffering:
The rernwdy for tbis condition undoubtedly lies
in a Canada-wide appreciation of Maritime disahilities
and a general realization that excessive freight rates
are choking ouI our industrial if e.

That is pretty strong language coming from
the leader of the Liberal Goverument in the
Province of Nova Scotia.
Now I will read what he says on the fish
question:
A third problem for which Nova Scotia seeks a solution lies in the soccesaful disposai of lier enormous
annual catch of fish. The fresh flsh trade has been
dislocated by reason of excessive express rates to
central Canada and the passing of the Fordney TariNf
at Washington.

but I arn quoting from the leading lights of
the Liberal party in Nova Scotia to show my
honourable friend and the members of this
House that these matters of Maritime importance are being complained about bitterly
by Lihprals as well as by Conservatives.
Let nie give my honourable friend a little
further idea of how the ýMorning Chronicle
talks about the situation. In another issue
of July, 1923, it uses a great deal stronger
language than I see in any of the Conservative newspa pers down there. It goes back to
1867 and speaks of the impasse between Ontario and Quebec, and says:
They could or would no longer cooperate with one
another. Apart, tbey were ready to fly at each other's
chroats. The aim was to provide a counterpoise by
means of the Maritime Provinces. New Brunswick was
Cajoled into thc unpromising union. Nova Scotia was

Hon. Mr. TANNER: I do net know the

is simply mention cf the Asseciated. Boards cf
Trade cf the Island cf Cape Breton. I desire te put on record what they have said,
beceuse 1 wouid like this honourabie House ta,
know that the matter is 'before the Gevernment:

Thse allit-d coal and ste2l industries of Nova Scotis
have be~n for some yenrs in a depressed condition.
At the prescrit tine unempinyment and consequeni
distress aînong those dependent upon the industries
for liveliisood is more serjous tisan in any recent period.
The prospect for tise future is that tisere may be
even more serious depression and resultant poverty.

I subinit to -this honourahie House that
that is a very serious Btatement, coming
froin the people who subinit it. It is pointed
eut here that these ciorrel'ated industries empiloy about 25,000 men and that practically
one-fiftlh of the wihole population cf Novn
Scotia are directly dependent upon tliose two
great industries, cei and steel. The situation
is pretty serious, then, as tihese gentlemen
point eut, when those two industries are on
the verge cf dissolution. "At no previeus
turne," the statement says, "liaà emplbyment
been so scarce and insecure, the future se
unpromising and the induatrial community se
discouraged, as st this date."
1 said that there was $120,000,000 worth cf
ceai coming i, while our mines are idle. On
the question cf steel and steel produets it is
pointed eut in this document that there were
in Canada in 1913 twenty-twe completed blast
furnaces; only six of these remained in operatien in 1923, and at this time-that is, the
turne of the presentatien-the number in blast
does net exceed twe furnaces. But while the
Canadian bl*ast furnaces, including thase in
Nova Scetia, are celd, there is coming i fromn
the United States $138,000,000 worth cf iran
and steel preducts produced in that country,
and in the preductien cf which. many thonsands cf men are given empicyment at gcod
wages, while the steel werkers cf Canada are
walking the streets leeking fer werk i vain.
That is the substance cf the representatien
made in regard te steel.
Now I wilI conclude this matter by simply
res ding the surnmary which appears en page
26 cf the statement:
The deputation, to surmnarize tiseir representations,
canoenly repeat that thse condition of the allied ceaI
and steel industries in Nova Seotia, and thse varied
interests that are dependent tisereen, la truly desperate,
and they cen ses no hope of relief from present

country for an indispensable material, would becomne

I leave that matter, heneurable gentlemen,
simply repeating the remark that it is net in

SENATE
any sen5ýe a partY question. It is a provincial
and national matter, upon which ail persons
are ag-reed. If Nova Scotia particularly is to
be regardcd as a partner in the Dominion of
Catnada worthy of any attention at all, worthy
of being looked after and trpati'd as a partner
in this Confederation, then the interests of
that province must be safeguarded.
You
cannot have a prosperous and contented
Dominion of Canada and have one end of it
decaying and the peuple fleeing from it as if
jr were a pestilence. Something must be done.
Those gentlemen who came bore ropresenting
the Province laid the cards on the table fairly
enough. They state just what is happening,
and t.hey point out what is necessary. They
declare that the protection which is now
afforded by the tariff amounts to nothing; that
the slack coal, 40 per cent of the coal produced in Nova Scotia, is unprotected.' The
United States send in their slack coal free
of dut.y. just as their anthracite comnes in.

Since that, except in the year 1923, it has
been dlown to 5,000,000 and 4,000,000. In 1923
it was slightly above 6,000,000 tons.

of the Premier of Nova Scotia, who wa-s until

Hon. Mr. TANNER: Yes.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Is it flot true that,
either on the occasion -of the last Federal
Election or at anme 'by-election, a promise
was made on behaif of the Governýment that
the duty would be increased?
Hon. Mr. TANNER:

Oh, yes.

Hon. Mr. LAIRD: How does hie account
for it not having been increased?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: We have volumes
of promises like that-volume---whole pages
of promises that the steel dubies would be
readjusted. My honourable friend the leader
of the Government knows that.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Were they not
readjusted?
Hon. Mr. TANNER- Readjusted? No.
Hon. Mr. DANDURA.ND: What about the

coal.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: -for the benefit of
the farming conamunity in the West.
I bave a speech by my friend Mr. Macdonald, in which hie made promises to th
steel-makers of Trenton. He mnade an accusation against the Consereatives that they ha
donse omething like that before. He said
"When you elect nme te go up to Ottawa, I
wýill sec to it that these duties on the steel
articles that go into the manufacture of
agricultural implements are reimposed so that
you will have plenty of work down here in
the steel plant in Trenton;" and he was going to have a duty put on anthracite enal
as well as bituminous coal coming from, the
Ulnited States.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Have yon any
figures to show to what extent it would
relieve the situation, or wb.at would be
required?

Hon. Mr. TANNER: The view held down
there is that we in Nova Scotia have a
legitimate right to a large part of the Quebec
and Ontario markets.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Assuming that,
what sort of a duty would bri.ng relief?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I think if the duty
were raised, probably to the basis of about
1879, it would be sufficient. I do flot know
whether I can put my linger on the exact
proportion now. I point this out to rny
honourable friend: that at the time the duty
wvas imposed Nova Scotia coal could be put
in the cellar for about $3 a ton, and the duty
on the American coal was 60 cents; today,
when I buy my coal I pay 812 to, have it
delivered to the side-walk, and have to pay to
have it put in.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
from the mines?

How far is that

And the duty is
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
proportionately very much lesu than it was.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But that is right
next door to the mines.
Hon. Mr. TANNER:- I know it is.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Railway freights
cannot be blamed for increasing the price
from $3 to $12.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: That is the price
we pay. That aspect of the matter is dealt
with in this statement. They ask for an
adjustment of the duty on Élack bitumiýnous
coal to at least the preEent duty on round
bituminous coal, and the inclusion under the
samne duty of anthracite dust and cleanings.
They a~k further the imposition of the duty
upon coal used in steel making and anetallurgical processes, now exempt from duty.
Then they a.sk for the readjustment of the
duty on iron and steel products. I shahl be
very pleased to let my honourable friend see

important document is before the Government, I think 1 haee fulfilled my duty in that
respect.

extent to which the falling off of the coal
industry would be helped?

SENATE

Hon. Mr. TANNER: Oh, I would flot
undertake to do that this aiternoon; I have
flot given sufficient .study to the matter.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Would it help at
ail?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Before I leave this
matter of freight rates and duties, I would
like to put in conjonction with the statement
of the Right Honourable Sir Wilfrid Laurier,
that I have read, the amsurance that we had
from the HonouTable W. S. Fielding in 1903.
This is the wvay hie putes the anatter:
Surely, sir, the ime bas corne after years of deception, bumbougging anti trickery about the lines to the
.Maritime Provint, s tbat faith sbould be kept with
Ibese people, andi tbey should have a through uine
running on Canadian territory from ocean to ocean.

The desire to see the Canadian ports on
the Atlantic and the Pacific used for Canadian
purposes, and Canadian railways carrying
Canadian ireight to those ports instead of to
United States ports is one ai the matters
which is interesting Nova Scotians and other
Maritime Province people very much indeed.
Now, honourable gentlemen, I may be
permitted ta make one or two observations in
regard ta a question which bas been dié-cussed
by some members of the Senate, namely, the
constitution of the Senate. I amrn ot going
ta dwell upon this question at length, but I
have been thinking about it a littie, and I
would like ta point out certain things. As I
see the matter, there is na parallel whatever
between the Senate of Canada and the Hause
of Lords. I think that iact bas been very
clearly established by anembers ai this Hanse
who have already s9poken. This Chamber is
canstituted by a statute; the House of Lords
bas grown up during centuries af time.' There
is nothing in writing which could be held in
any way ta curtail the powers -of the Huse
ni Lords. The powers of the Senate are
clearly defined in the British North America,
Act; and now this bouse is being accused
ai doing the very thing which it was created
ta do.
I ar n ot gaing ta say that the Constitution
under which Canada is governed should flot
be revised or reconsidered. The time may
corne when it may be necessary ta do that
in the public interest; but I submit that
when sa serious a matter bas ta be taken in
hand, it should be done anly for good reason
and aiter thorough and welI-digested consideration.
It is a mistake ta say or ta think that there
was ha.ste in the OMd Country in regard ta
what is called the Parliament Act. My recollection is that it came after the bouse of
Lords as then constituted had deliberately
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT.

set itself ta the business af thwarting the
Campbell-Bannerman Governmnent. At least,
that was the charge made; and my readixug
ratihier convinces me tihat -the allegation was
correct, because practically aIl the important
measures that went ta the flouse of Lords
du-ring that period irom the Campbell-Ban-,
nerman Government were either mutilated
or tbrown out completely; and I think history will canfirm. the statement that the
Campbell-Bannerman Goverrment, bad really
good cause for a grievance against the bouse
of Lards at that time. Notwithstanding that,
the Campbell-Bannerman Governmenz was
very slow ta mave for a reformi of the flouse
af Lords, and I tbink I arn right, when I say
that it was not until a subsequent Government came into office that the Parliament
Aet vas pessed. I know I have read flot very
long since, in Spender's Lufe af CampbellBannerman, a very interesting- discussion ai
the subject; and Campbell-Bannerman prepared many lengthy statements in which hie
expressed greaýt fear lest worsc results should
follow from reforming the bouse ai Lords
than were already being experienced.
Now, what is the condition af affuirs ini
Canada? This whole matter has originated
iromn a little political anger. A year ago this
Chamber, in discbarging the very duties which
the British North America Act intended it
ta disebarge land laid upon it-the safeguarding ai the financial and publie welfarecaused the Prime Minister ini bis anger ta
threaten what he would do ta the Senate.
Is that the temper in whieh ta approach a
questianal ai constitutional change? la that
the attitude which should bc taken in approaching sa important a matter as changing
the British North America Act?
To my
mind the genesis ai the wbole proposai is
wvrong: it is wrong for the reasan I have just
stated, and for the reason that there is no
justification for it.
What happened?
The Prime Minister
went West. I have in my possession a ]etter
ptisýhed 'by an honourable member af this
House, the honourable membs'r for Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Griesbarh), in whic)ý he takes the
Prime Minister ta task for deliberately misrepresenting the action ai this Chamber ini
regard ta, the railways affecting the province
ai Alberta. He shows ta, a demonstration
that for the sake ai currying a little favour
an the question ai Senate reiorm, the Prime
Minister went inta, the province ai Alberta
and deliberately misrepresented the action ai
this honourable House. We- had the other
day the statement ai the honourable member irom British Columbia (lIon. Mr. Taylor) which convicted the Pr-*me Minister ai

FEBRUARY 13, 1925

further deliberate misstatements in reference
to the Kelowna railway in British Columbia.
I want to say now, honourable gentlemen,
that it is nlot creditable to this country to
have a Prime Minister who goes abroad and
for the sake of a littîe petty, polîtical, partizan success nlot only undertakes to assail
honourable members of this House unjustly,
but is willing to apply the gun to the wbole
constitutional provision regarding the Senate
simply because, as one honourable member
bas said, he cannot get bis own way. I am
împressed by the idea that a gentleman lîke
the Prime Minister, however worthy he may
be in other respects, is only here for a little
wble-we are all here for only a Pittie while
-but tbe Constitution and this institution
are here for ail tirne; and it iE not for a man
dressed in a littie brief authority to say that
lie will not only chastize honourable gentle.
men because lie is offended in his person by
somptbing they have done, but will uproot
the whole institution.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: Then, when be came
back to Ottawa be produced this policy of a
conference. However, I amn not going to dwell
in this matter any longer. I just want to say
that 1 do not take it seriously, not only
because of the reasons which I bave stated,
but because I bave lived through a campaign
of the same kind in Nova Scotia. In Nova
Scotia ive have a Legislative Council, a Liberal
Legislative Council, with just one Conservative in it. For 30 years to my knowledge
the members of the Libeýral Government of
that Province bave continually exerted themselves to stand up for a policy of abolition
of the Legislative Council, and tbey bave
gone s0 far as to take from every gentleman
who passes through the doors of that institutieon a written undertaking, signe-d by him,
to vote for the abolition of that Legisiative
Council. They have trunks filled with those
undertakings, all signcd by good Liberals.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Only Liberals?

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Wbere is my, bonourable friend's authority for that statement?

Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: There is no one
else there.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: And do you know,
honourable gentlemen, that Legislative Council
is more strongly entrcnched to-day than it
was 30 yeare ago. There was no mýore intention
of abolishing it 30 years ago th-aun there is
to-day, and there is no more intention of
abolishing it to-day than there wau 30 years
ago.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Are tbey etil
taking written undertakinga?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Oh, yes, and tbe
remarkable thing is that they say these
exemplary Liberals wiIl not vote the way they
promiSed to vote; they actually break their
promises.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Have they been
put to the test?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Oh, yes, sometimes.
It is said that there are one or two conscientious ones who stand up as the vote is
taken, but they get well to the end of the hune,
and if they eee that the mai ority is going
to bie against abolition tbey vote for it; but
they make sure of theïr -calling first by watching how the vote ie going. Remembering
that, and remembering that my honourable
friend in 1904, 1 think, was associated with.
the policy of abolition or reform of the Senate,
I am sure that we do not stand in very great
danger from the present menace of the Right
Honourable William Mackenzie King.
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: Honourable
gentlemen, 1 rise to make a statement in

Hon. Mr. TANNER:- I get it fromn tbe
speeches which the Prime Minister made out
West. Read what the leader of the Progressive party said the otber day.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
Where did the
Premier say that lie was going to uproot tbe
whole Constitution, or words to that effect?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Perbaps my figure of
speech is a littie strong, but I gave expression
to what the Prime Minister really meant. He
was going to make a great change; lie was
going to take the sting out of this Chamber;
he was going to make honourable members
ornamnente of no use, and, baving no force and
no power. I do not sece any difference hetween
uprooting tbf s Chamber and taking away ail
its powers. One, I tbink, is just about as bad
as the other. He went to the West and made
these statements in British Columbia, Alberta
and other parts of the West. The leader of
the Progressive party waa so impressed that
he expected, so hle said the other day, a drastic
measure in regard to the Senate. But the
Prime Minister learned miore wisdjm when
lie came Est. When lie got as far as Toronto,
lie moderajted bis attack; tben lie went down
to Quebec, where I do not think lie even
mentioned the Senate. He either forgot it,
or oonaidered, it the part of wisdom not to say
anything about it.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Anyway he backed
down.

answer to the honourable the senior member
for Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt). He asked
for information which the honourable gentleman who was speaking did not have under
his hand, and made the observation that the
production of coal in Nova Scotia was probably reduced in 1924 as compared with the
war period because of the fact that the war
requirements had been diminished and naturally production wou'ld diminish. The total
consumption of coal in Eastern Canada in 1924
was 9,719,000 tons, of which 4,150,000 tons were
imported and 5,569,000 tons produced. In
1920, the year of peak production of all things
in Canada, the importation of coal from the
United States for the same territory was
2.628.000 tons, and the production 6,370,000
tons. In other words, with an increased total
consumption the production has dropped threequarters of a million tons. So that my honourable friend's thought would hardly hold good
according to the facts presented in this report.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL:

Is that all bitumin-

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

With referHon. JOHN McCORMICK:
ence to the question of the honourable gentleman frome Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt), it
is perhaps important to remember that when
the existing duty of 53 cents a ton was put on
bituminous coal and 14 cents on slack coal
under the tariff of 1897, the price of run-ofmine delivered on board ship was around $2.50,
and the price of slack coal was 60 cents. There
was a greater difference then than there is
now. That is easily understood when you
remember that the establishment of blast
furnaces in Canada has taken place since that
duty went on in 1897, and that as a result of
the establishment of the steel industry in Caný
ada the price of slack coal has increased to a
very much greater extent than the price oh
run-of-mine, for the reason that in large steel
plants and in the manufacture of coke slack
coal is largely used. I have not the exact
figures as to the difference in price, but I think
that in 1897 slack coal was at 60 cents a ton
and run-of-mine at $2.50, and last year run-ofmine coal imported from the United States
into the provinces of Ontario and Quebec was
valued at the border by the Customs Department at, I think, $3.20.

ing to show tihat the duty on bituminious
coal is now scarcely any protection at all,
whereas it was a reasonable protection in 1897.

of coal to-day is $4.50 a ton, and the duty is
the same as before, namely 53 cents; so you
have a duty of not much more than 12 per
cent.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY:
If a good, stiff
duty were imposed, sufficient to shut out
American coal, would the Nova Scotia coal be
sold to the consumer at the sane money that
would bring in the other coal?
Hon. Mr. McCORMICK:
To the extent
that the railways could supply it. On account
of the difficulties in the way of transportation
Nova Scotia might not be able to supply the
province of Ontario. That is a large question,
and perhaps we shall deal with it later.
It must be remembered that on account of
geographical

position and

the increased

cost

of transportation Nova Sootia is deprived of
a market in Central Canada for products that
we used to send her'; for instance, coal in
the winter time.
Up to the time of the
war we sent coal into the city of Montreal,
in the winter time, from places like Springhill.
Now we are shut out of the Montreal
market on account of the excessive cost of
transportation.
Bituminous slack coal to the amount of
3,800,000 tons came into Canada in 1923, and
that slack coal bears a duty of only 14 cents
a ton.
That is a mere bagatelle; it is no
Furthermore, a large porprotection at all.
portion of that coal which is imported at a
duty of 14 cents a ton is mixed with a runof-mine and sold to the consumer right here
in the province of Quebec or the province of
Ontario at the same price as run-of-mine. In
that way the consumer gets a larger proportion of slack coal than comes from the
ordinary mining of coal, and when it is sold
as run-of-mine the country is deprived of a
revenue of 39 cents a ton; and every ton of
that bituminous slack that cores into Canada
under those conditions is helping to deprive
the coal miners of the province of Nova Scotia
of a legitimate market in the province of
Quebec.

TANNER.

a

FEBRLARY 13, 1925
Now, I do ask that in ail fairness, as this
coal is used here for the same purpose as
run-of-rnine coal, the same duty that is
charged against run-of-mine, namely, 53 cents
a ton, should be iniposed on slack coal.
I
think we are entitled to that, because the
absence of adequate protection is a hardship.
It has flot been creaited ail at once. During
the years osf the war, as it fias been 9tated
by my honourable friend, the produot4on. in
Nov-a Sc-otia was something like 6,000,000 toýns.
One oif our first difficulties was that the war
took away a great many of our mnen. I arn
proud to say that in the mining section from
wfhich I corne our people realized -their duty
as citizens, and in that section-Sydney Mines
and Florence andi the lower end of Bras d'Or,
with a population of 12,000, there were 1,031
voluntary enlistments, almost entirely from
among the.coal mining people and the workers
in the steel industry.
In another way the coal industry waa hurt.
The coal that was shipped to our large market
in the province of Quebec, amounting to about
21y miillion tons, wae carried, largely, though
not entirely hy a special class of ship. These
sh-ips were commandeered, into, the service of
the Empire for the transportation of supplies
andi munitions to Europe for the Allies during
the war, and for a couple of years after the
close of the war they were not returned.
There is also this important factor, which
I would, like te impress iipon honourable
members, that the value of slack coal has
greatly increased as compared with what it was
in 1897.
When the duty of 14 cents a ton
was imposed, that coal was worth about 60
cents a ton. Now only the samne duty of 14
cents is levied on a comrnodity that was last
yea.r valued by the Customns Department at
$3.20 a ton. It is not a protection tariff at
ail.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will xny honourable friend tell us what duty would be required?
Hon. Mr. MoGORMICK: Fifty-three cents
is what the rnining people of Nova Scotâa
think ought to be imposed on that bituminous
slack coal a.nd anthracite slack and dust.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: And you want
besicles that a considerable change in the
freight rate? What would that be?
Hon. Mr. MoCORiMICK: I do not wish
to discuss that now. 0f t.he entire production
of coal of the province of Nova Seotia the
major piortion is in Cape Breton, the section
- itom which I corne, and some of it is in
Pictou County. Coal is shi.pped during the
open season of navigation. That is water-

borne. Transportation by water is the most
econornical way of carrying it. If the duty
on biturniinous slack coal, as weil as on runof-mine, were 53 cents a ton, we might wait
for a decrease in the rail rate. It would, I
think, bring about a great deal of ixuprovement and help largely to solve the difficulties of the coal m-ining people of the province of Nova Scotia.
Hon. J. W. DANIEL: As a partial answer
to the question by the honourable Senator
from Selkirk (Hon. Mr. Bradbuiry), I rnay
say this, that the coal which is burned in the
power-house that supplies this building witb
heat cornes from New Brunswick. What price
is paid per ton I do not know. but I have
been inforrned that as far as quality is concerned it is extrernely satisfactory, and that
the Government are savàng a considerable
arnount of money by using the New Brunswick coal instead of what they were using
before.

TRIBUTES TO THE LATE HON. SENATORS
BOLDUC, YEO, GODBOUT, FOWLER,
MURPHY AND COTE
BEREAVEMENT OF HON. R. DANDURAND

Hon. N. A. BELCOURT: Honourable gentlemen, a very sad occurrence, which we all
deeply deplore, and to which I may be permitted to make reference hefore I resume my
seat, has cast upon me the unusually difficult
and in this instance perilous task-and it is
all the more so because I have had but very
few moments for thought or preparation-the
task of voicing our feelings of sincere sympathy and deep condolence on the departure
of so many of our colleagues. During the last
twelve months the inevitable and insatiable
Grim Reaper has been exceedingly busy in our
midst. No less than six of our colleagues in
this House have been its victims: the honourable member for the Lauzon Division in
the Province of Quebec, the late Senator Bolduc; the honourable member for East Prince
in the Province of Prince Edward Island, the
late Senator John Yeo; the honourable member for the La Salle Division in the Province
of Quebec, the late Senator Godbout; the
honourable member for Kings and Albert
in the Province of New Brunswick, the late
Senator Fowler; the honourable member for
Tignish, in Prince Edward Island, the late
Senator Patrick Murphy; the honourable the
member for Edmonton, the late Senator Jean
L. Côté.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

The first named, the late Mr. Bolduc, was
continuously a member of our Parliament for
nearly half a century-to be exact, for fortyeight years; of which forty were spent as a
member of this House. He was Speaker of
the Senate for the ordinary full term, always
discharging his duties as such with ability and
perfect impartiality.
Mr. Bolduc was contemporary, friend, or counsellor of every Prime
Minister since Confederation, from the Right
Hon. Sir John A. Macdonald down to the
Right Hon. W. L. Mackenzie King, always
taking an active part in the conduct of public
affairs, in and out of Parliament. A strong
party man, but ever a fair opponent. a most
considerate and companionable colleague.
Few, very few, of our public men have performed as long, as continuous and as faithful
duty and service to their native province and
to Canada. Of him it can with truth and
justice be said that he was at all time and
under all conditions and circumstances "vir
probus et bonus."
The late Mr. Yeo was one of the most
affable and lovable men who ever sat in
either of the two branches of this Parliament.
He sat in both. His record for continuous
service, first in the Legislature of hie native
province, then in the elective chamber of
this Parliament, and finally in this honourable
House, is probably unequalled in the political
annals of Canada. Contemporaneously with
the attainment of his majority he was elected
a member of the Legislative Assembly of
Prince Edward Island, the Province in which
he was born, and in that assembly he sat
without interruption for 33 years. For 32
years thereafter-8 in the House of Commons and 24 in this House-he was an
assiduous and ever deeply interested member
of this Parliament. Altogether he rendered
65 years of continuous public service. From
the beginning he won and until the last he
retained and richly deserved, the confidence,
admiration and affection of everyone in his
own community and here, irrespective of
party, religious or ethnical affiliation. What
a noble, patriotie and inspiring example of
public service, well and faithfully performed,
our dear departed friend and colleague has
left to us all and to those who, after we have
served our time, will be called to "carry on"!
In the person of the late Mr. Godbout we
have another remarkable example of patriotie
duty long and thoroughly accomplished;
quietly, unostentatiously, but yet effectively.
His modesty, hie affability, his constant wish
and will to be of service in his own community, in his professional calling and in the
larger field of parliamentary life and activity,
never failed. The dignity of his life, his gentle

MAROR 10, 1925
manners, deeply impressed ail those. with
whon lie came in contact. He served 14
years in the Blouse of Commons; and 22 years
in this Bouse and always aoquitted himself
as a true and accomplislied gentleman.
A keen, clear, and ever-ready debater,
wliether in the flouse or before Committees,
was the later member for Kings and Albert
in the Province of New Brunswick, tlie Hon.
Mr. Fowler. Holding tenaciously to his own
views and conceptions of men and affairs,
and expressing tliem in vigourous and sometimes in aggressive language, lie yet displayed
frequently marked independence of tliough'z
and action, witli a ready willingness to submit
to the force of logic or propriety. Bis cooperation in committees, because of his professional knowledge and experience, his liabit
of probîng things thoroughly. was invaluable
Wlien lie was stricken down by tbe illness
wlidh terminated bis life lie had become a
very valuable member of tlie Sonate.
The late Senator Patrick Cliarles Murphy
was an almost perfect specimen of that great
and chivaîrous race wliose main habitat is in
the Green Isle in the North Sea, wlioee sons
have penetrated to the four corners of the
earth and have taken in many parts a conspicuous share in the conduet of public affairs;
wlio have won and received very generous
support from other etlinical groupe, and nowbere more so than in our own country, where
they have been very frequently selected for
political representation and lionour, and more
particularly by the ethnical element to whicli
I have the lionour to belong. Bis powers
of observation, bis analytical mind, bis wit
and humour made of him a wortby and
dangerous opponent in any debate. He, like
so 'Inany of bis compatriote, always took an
active part in public aif airs, and long 'lefore lie came to this Bouse lie was known and
beloved by nil in bis own community, bie,cause of bis manly qualities, bis professional
ability, and bis constant disposition to be of
service to everyone. Bis was the rare distinction o! having four sons engaged in active
service during the Great War.
In the untimely deatli of the late Jean
Léon Côté the Senate mourus the loss o! one
o! its most recent members. We are again
reminded that, though death is inevitable and
certain, there is nothing more uncertain than
the time and manner of ite coming. Among
the departed colleagues to whom I have refcrred we find both the oldest and the youngest members of this Bouse. The late Mr.
Côté, hike rnost of those wlio are within hearing of my voice, had served bis country in
various ways, and in bis case at times under
S--7

97

very Spartan and strenuous conditions. As a
Dominion Land Surveyor and pioneer ho spent
many years in the North-west portions of
Canada, in the Klondyke and in Northern
Alberta, in the Civil Service, in his capacity
as a Dominion Land Surveyor, later as a member of the Legisiative Assembly, and later
again as a member of the Cabinet of the
Province of Alberta. The intimate knowledge
acquired by him of the northern country and
its needs, and the large experience which lie
had gained there, would certainly have made
of him a most valuable member of this House.
Lt was my privilege to have been intimately
associated with him by ties of friendship and
of business, and I always entertained the
higliest conception of his probity, ability and
stability.
To the wives, chuldren, relatives, friends and
neighbours of our departed colleagues I wish
to convey our deep sympathy, and express the
hrpe that they may find the courage and the
consolation which wlll help them to bear their
great loss.
My task, painful and difficult as it is, is
r.ot yet accomplished. I have no doubt whatever that I shall meet your wish and expectation if I take this opportunity to express for
every member of this Senate lis deep and
cordial sentiments o! sincere s5ympatby with
the lionourable leader of the Government in
this Bouse in the sad and cruel blow which lie
bas so recently received. 0f ahl the separations upon this earth-and life contains inany
for ail of us--there is none to which can be
compared the loss of one's if e companion,
one's supreme friend, counsellor and collaborator.
The leader i bhis Bouse, whose virtues of
he.art and mmnd, whose friendly and gentie
relations and manners are universally acknowledged and who performa wîth never-failing
couTtoey and friendly consideration for ail
the difficuIt and exacting duties of leadership,
can rest assured that lie bas earned and is
to-day receiving the lieartiest sympatliy of
every member o! this Bouse in his overwlielming bereavement.
Speaking for myself, it was my very good
fortune to be a lifelong personal friend of
botb M. and Madame Dandurand. It was
My privïiege *many times to applaud the
marked literary successes which slie aceomplished and for whîch she received great rewards at home and abroad, and to lie a witness of the deep respect and admiration which
she had eurned by lier womxanly, rnotberly
and wifely virtues, as well as by tlie active
interest and sliare alie constantly took in
public affairs within the sphere of excluoively
sane and sound womanhood.

SENATE

The loss of our friend and colleague can
with difficulty be measured even by those who
have had the privilege of a thorough acquaintance with the late Madame Dandurand. It
may be a source of consolation and comfort
to him to know that we are all aware of the
indefatigable, gentle and tender care constantly
bestowed by him upon ber during the many
many years of ber invalidism.
We all ardently wish that lie may be spared
the strength and courage which lie needs now
more than ever in order to discharge the
exacting, highly responsible and arduous
functions and duties committed to him.
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: Honoura;ble
gentlemen, may I join briefly with my honourable friend the senior member from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Belcourt) in a few words of condolence at this time.
Death, like time, is no respecter of persons.
Since Parliament last prorogued many have
passed from our midst-among them, as my
honourable friend has said, probably the
oldest and the youngest in point of service
in parliamentary life, and in this House-men
ripe in experience and in years and men in
the prime of their usefulness.
I am sure that we all without exception
have particularly tender and friendly and
warm feelings for our late Mr. Speaker,
Senator Bolduc, who during a long and useful
life was known to the Parliament and the
people of Canada for almost half a century.
The Hon. Mr. Bolduc was an illustrions descendant of a noble French family who contributed to the settlement and colonization
of Lower Canada more than 250 years ago.
Few men enjoyed the confidence, the respect,
and indeed the affection of the people more
than he. His distinguished and conspicuous
service to the people cf bis own community
in Beauce County caused him to be almost
unanimously selected as their parliamentary
representative for many years. After being
called to the Senate, bis kindly and lovable
disposition endeared him to all bis colleagues,
so that when opportunity presented itself
lie was elevated to the high and honourable
position of Speaker. Many of us have the
most pleasant and kindly recollections of his
service in that capacity. The geniality, fairness and kindness which characterized his
every act, in the discharge of both bis official
and bis social duties, will long be remembered.
It can be truly said of him that he touched
nothing that lie did not adorn.
Neither can we forget the many courtesies
extended to members of this House by Madame Bolduc, who assisted ber husband with
such dignity and grace.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

My honourable friend the senior member
for Ottawa has so fittingly referred to the
many excellent qualities and conspicuous services of Senator Bolduc that further comment
seems superfluous, except to add that he was
a friend to all and that bis memory will ever
occupy a conspicuous place in the hearts of bis
colleagues.
The late Senator Yeo, the member for East
Prince, was a pioneer in the life of his own
Province, engaging in business activities that
were most useful in the development and upbuilding of that part of the Dominion. For
nearly forty years lie served bis native Province as a member of the Legislative Assembly
and a member of the Provincial Government,
part of the time as Speaker of the Legislature.
His services were so appreciated that lie was
sent to Parliament, fist to the House of Commens and subsequently to this Chamber. He
rendered conspicuous service in both business
and public activities for more than half a century, and at the close of a long life, rich
in service and honour, lie, like many a staunch
ship which lie built, crossed the bar and went
out to sea.
The activities and life of our late friend and
colleague Senator Godbout have been fittingly
referred to by my honourable friend. Personally I did not have the honour and pleasure
of an intimate acquaintance with him-perhaps because of bis somewhat retiring disposition, and because, as my honourable friend
from Ottawa bas so fittingly said, the grace
and quiet dignity with which lie did his work
made him so inconspicuous aiong bis fellows
that I was not in a position to know very much
of the late Senator's personal usefulness. I
join, however, with my honourable friend in
eulogy of the service and kindness and geniality in this House of the honourable gentleman,
and share with my honourable friend the feeling to which he has given utterance.
The late member for Kings and Albert. Senator Fowler, was a man well known in the
public life of Canada, first in the House of
Commons and later in this Chamber. He
was a man who championed fearlessly any
cause in which lie was deeply interested and
in which lie believed. I think he could properly be described as either a loyal friend or a
worthy foc. In political life lie sometimes
spoke very plainly, indeed aggressively, but
nevertheless the sane genial George Fowler
was always recognized by political friends and
focs alike as a man of broad-minded principles
and big heart. As my honourable friend bas
said, lie was not spared to hive out the usual
term of a man's life, but was called away
while still at the height of bis usefulness; and

MARCH 10, 1925
per'haps, we sy'mpatbize more keenly with the
friends and relatives of those who are cut
off in the prime of life than of those who have
lived to mature years.
Senator Murphy was well known both here
and in bis native Province. He was in the
prime of if e, cut off before bis time in the
midst of an active and useful service to -the
people of the com-'munity in which he aived.
Senator Murphy was born in the 'littie islarid
Province, where lie grew up to render useful
service in the medical profession, and 'later
came to this Chamber as one of the representatives of that province. We ail regret
lis early passing, and extend to hie widow
-and~ friends our most sincere sympathy.
The Hon. Mr. Cô~té, from bis appearance,
was almost the .iast m&n that we would expect to be called from our rnidst-a man of
fine physique, sturdy in build as well as in
character, a mani for whom one wouRd have
expected a long period of servi-ce in this
Chamber. He was a pioneer in the Province
of Alberta and did much to unfuri the banner
of civilization li that Province, which he
knew as perhaps f ew other men d1id. Hlis
passing has been a very distinct loss indeed
both to bis native province and to Canada
as a whdle.
We on this side of the House join in extexiding our respectful and heartfelt sympatby te
the memibers of the bereaved familles and the
friends of the deceaised Senatom.
I join with my bonourable friend from
Ottawa ini extending most sincerely to our
respected leader in this Chamber the sympatlur
of the members, particularly on this aide of
the House, in the severe loss which he bas
so recently sustained. Madame Dandur-and
perhaps was not known intimately te many
of us. I had the honour and p(leasure of
forming her acquaintance a few years ago,
some time after she had become a conflrmed
invalid, and seldomn does one meet a lady who
bears her physicai afflictions more cheerfully
or with more fortitude and patience than
did Madame Dandurand. She was eonspicuous
in good works, distinguished herself in literary
pursuits, was notable for ber charitable efforts,
and words fail te express the feeling that one
would fain express to our friend the leader
of this House in this heur of bis bereavement,
Hon. PASCAL POIRIER:
Honourable
gentlemen, if I rise to addi' a few words to
what has heen so well and feelingly said of
our departed colleagues, it is because two
of tbem hailed from New Brunswick, and
because I arn the senior member cf this
Huse from that province.
Mlost of the
Senators from New Brunswick have been
S-7ýj

99

spared to a ripe age; one of them, Senator
Wark, spanning a century and more. But
what are a hundred years, what are a thousand
years, when the exid has corne? Everything
that lias an ending is of short duration, and
tiane itself, by which we zneasure the length
of our eartbly lives, is possibly but a concept;
at most it is a transition between two eternities. To-morrow is flot yet and yesterday is
no more. Nothing remeûins of Mie but thie
record of the acts performed during its fleeting
passage.
Our departed colleagues were true Christians, wbo no doubt served their Master
faithfully, and they aIl bave gene te their
eternal reward. But they also served their
country well, and bave left a heritage of
which we their survivoSs are the legatees
and beneficiaiies, a heritage consisting of
lives spent in the performance of good and
useful works. Eacb of them in bis own province stood in the f orefront, net only in the
performance of good works, but ini al the
activities that pertained te industry, commerce, or the practice of liberal professions.
Tbis much can be said of good works, bonourable gentlemen, that they precede us and
remaixi behind us, serving as a beacon te
younger gexierations to be guided by. Longfellow bas rigbtly said tbat. departing we leave
behind us footprints on the sands cf time.
Before taking my seat may I aIse extend
my meat cordial and deepest condolences to
the benourable leader of this bouse in the
irreparable bass of bis most distinguisbed
life-mate, Madame Dandurand.
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
Honourable
gentlemen, I bave the honour te inform the
Senate that I bave received the following
letter:
My dear Mr. Speaker:
Will you kindly convey to my colleagues my heartfelt thanks for the expression of their sympathy at the
demise of Madame Dandurand, and for their splendid
floral tribute.
Most sincerely yours,
R. Dandurand.

I tbink I should explain te the honourable members of the Senate that on this
occasion I tbought I was expressing their
wisbes in instructing the Clerk te, sexid a

My honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
friend refers to the British Government in

MARCH 11, 1925
London. 1 cannot say whether or flot they,
as wéli as the other Dominions were made
au fait of the negotiations. As this was a
matter exclusively within the domain of Canada, there was no need to notify the outside
sister nations. I take it for granted that ini
this matter of treaties, ini accordanve with the
resolution of October 1923, Great Britain put
itself on an absolute parit-y with the -other
sister nations, the resolution affirming the
freedom of each sister nation to deal with
foreign affaira pertaining only to itself, and
being of a general nature and applicable to
Great Britain as well as to the Dominions.
This Treaty wss ratified by the Senate of
the United States on Deceember 12, 1924.
W'hen apiproved by the Canadian Parliament
it will be ratified by Canada, and an exehange
of ratifications wMl follow.
Article 1 of this Tresty relates to the exchange of information between the officiais
of the two Governments, ini respect to
clearances of ve,,sels or transportation of cargoes of dutiable articles across the international line. It provides. with respect to
clearances of vessels, th-at where there is reason
to b-elieve that smuggiling of articles prohibited
in. the neighbouring country is about to take
place, the oflicers of the exporting country
shali give information to tihe neighhour ini
order to aasist it in preventing smuggiing
operations.
Article 2 provides that where it appears,
from the size, the tonnage, or the general
charaicter of any vessel about to olear frora
a Ulnited States port or a Canadian port to
some port desi'gnated. that it wouid be inpossible for the vessel to reach such destination, olearance -,hall be den'ied if the cargo
consista of goods prohibited in the neighbouring country. In other words, if, for
instance, a clearance is asked for Cuba from
a port in the United States, or for the, West
Indies from a port in Cansda, and if it appears
to the officer that the boat is not of such a
size and tonnage as to be able to weather the
seas, -and lie has strong suspicions that it is
flot reaiLy destined for the port designated,
it will be -his dirty to refuse eifraran-ce. I xnay
say that the Customns Department has ýalready,
oome months since, adopted regulations to
this saine effect.
Article 3 of the Treaty contains a provision
for the return to the owner of pro'perty stole.n
acroes the border and- eeized, by Customs
officiaIs.
I will give a concrete case.
Hundreds of motor cars are t-aken, say, froin
Rouse's Point to Montreal. They are seized
by the Customs officiaIs and are sold a~t publie
auction for the benefit of the Customs, without
regard to the fact that the victi-m in the other

country rnay present himself and claim. ownership of the car. I have been informned that
mcn who had stolen cars did not hesitate to
bring them practically into the hands of the
Customs officials, in order that they might
be seized, and when the cars were seized and
sold these persons were present to buy there
back for a song; and then, when the car lied
a coat of paint and a Canadian -titie, they
could return with it to the United States,
.paying little duty on a valuable car. 1
mention this instance as one of the abuses
that are cured by the Treaty. The owner of
the stolen article may follow it to Canada,
or vice versa to the United States, establish
his titie, and recover it.
Article 4 relates to an exchange of information as to names and activities of persons who
are suspected to be engagied in violations of
the laws of the two countries. It is most
important that the officers on both sides
shouid work hand in hand to protect our two
coramuni-ties £rom this plague froin which
bath countries are suffering, and the greater
the co-operatýion between the officers of the
two countries the better will our own iaws be
enforced.
There is another provision in the Treaty
permitting a country that needa witne8ses
froin the other country-mostly officiais in
cases of violations of the laws of the country
-to summon such witnesses, -and permitting
those officiais to, answer the cal]. The summoning country agrees to pay the expenses of
the witnesses se, calied.
Article 6 of the Treaty contains a provision
with respect to the conveyance of prisoners,
records and salvage where offences are coinmitted against n'arcotic iaws. IJader the
Treaty of 1908 officers cf eithcr country, in
charge of prisoners accused of specified
offences, may under certain regulations pass
with their prisoners through the territory of
the other country. The present Convention
adds offences against narcctic laws to this
specified list. It would apply to any point
where a railway or other road crosses the
boundary.
Article 7 admits cf importation into the
Yukon, through American territory, of liquors
iegaily imported under the Yukon laws or
regulations. This is on a parity with. the right
cf transit, through the Panama Canai or by
the Panama railway, of alcoholie liquors. I
may say that this authorization on the part
of the United States of our alcohol to pass
froin Skagway to the Yukon exi.sted for a
number cf years, but ail of a sudden some of
the American officiais decided that they had
no power to give such an authorization. This
arrangement makes it clear that Canada may

102

SENATE

transport its liquor under the Yukon laws or
regulations through American territory.
The Treaty will be in force for one year,
and thereafter it will be subject to thirty
days' notice. It will come into force ten days
after its ratification.
If I am not mistaken, when we were discussing the Temperance Act a couple of years
ago, the right honourable the junior member
for Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster) moved for such regulation as would prevent Canadians from violating laws of the
United States. I think this is a step in the
right direction. Perhaps it does not go as far
as my right honourable friend desired, but I
believe that it will meet with the commendation of this Chamber.
I move the adoption of the Resolution,
seconded by Hon. Mr. Watson.
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: Honourable
gentlemen, not for the purpose of criticism at
all, but rather for the purpose of information,
I would like to make a few observations.
Probably my honourable friend the leader of
the Government could enlighten the House
and clear up the points that I have in mind.
My honourable friend has specifically
stated that the terms of this Treaty are such
as to refer to matters that are wholly within
the jurisdiction and domain of the United
States and the Canadian Governments and
do not affect other parts of the British Empire.
I think that is true in part of them. I see,
or think I see, a situation whicl might arise
wherein the British Government itself might
feel that some of its citizens were involved.
Article 1 of the Treaty provides that it is
compulsory on the part of the two Governmonts, upon request, to give information to
each other respecting shipments of dutiable
goods passing between the two countries. Subsequent sections provide that either country
may require the witnesses from the other to
aid in the prosecution and conviction of those
who violate the laws. It occurs te me that
it might possibly happen that British subjects
who are not Canadian citizens migit at some
time find theinselves in the toils as a result
of a violation, or alleged violation, of the
smuggling laws, and that if, by reason of the
terms of this Treaty, the Canadian Govern-

ment through its officials were the instrument
through which British subjects who are not
Canadian citizens become involved in criminal
proceedings, and the British Government
might be concerned, at least indirectly, in the
Treaty. I would ask my honourable friend
if that point has received the consideration
of the Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Then, I notice that Article 1 provides that
information with reference to the dispatch of
shipments either by land or water is only
to be given upon request; but in the last
sentence of the same Article it refers to shipments that are cleared for foreign ports, and
the Government seems to be under obligation
to furnish without request information respecting the clearance of those vessels.
Perhaps
my honourable friend could tell us why the
distinction was necessary as between the land
and the water shipments.
Again, I note that there is a wide discretion
left to the Customs Department with reference to determining what is and what is not
a sea-going vessel. It may be very difficult
exactly to define that in words, but we all
know that very small boats, indeed canoes,
have been crossing the Atlantic, as experimonts, sporting propositions, etc. The matter
would be simplified, I think, by some minimum
line being drawn for the guidance of Customs
officials, as the judgment of some of those
officials at some ports might differ from that
of others, and it might be wise if the Government named some particular tonnage as the
minimum which would entitle a boat to clearance to an ocean port, by which I mean
Cuba, the West Indies or Mexico.
I might also submit to my honourable friend
this question: if a boaft that is regarded by
the Customis Department as capable of making
a sea voyage is cleared from a Canadian port
for Cuba, for example, and two or three days
afterwards it seeks to clear from a Canadian
port again, whether or net the fact that it
was cleared for Cuba only a few days before
would be regarded by the Government as
sufficient justification for declining the second
clearance papers sought?
I might also inquire as to a practice which
I have heard is in existence on the Pacifie
coast in connection with the transportation of
liquor. I am not sure that my information
is absolutely correct, but I think it is.
It
is to this effect, that the British Columbia
Government requires evidence of a boat having
cleared frore the port to which it is destined;
that is to say, if a boat leaves the port of
Vancouver destined to a port in Mexico or
on the Pacific coast, before it can get a second
clearance paper from the port of Vancouver
it must produce evidence of the fact that it
has been at the port of destination mentioned
in the previous clearance papers. I am informed that it frequently occurs that boats
clearing for Mexico produce papers showing
that they have been to Mexico and back
again within 48 or 60 hours of the time that
they left Vancouver on the first voyage.

103

MARCH 11, 1925
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Were they net air boats?
HEon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Net that I arn
aware. They may have been oil burners, or
possibly alcohol burners. These are points
on which my honourable friend might give
us some information, whether provision has
been mnade for these emergencies.
There are
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
some questions that beax on this Treaty
which only Customs officiais could answer,
and I arn sorry not to have tjhought od having by my side the Deputy Minister of Custons. If my honourable friend feels Vhat the
matter is of such importance that the motion
for the adoption of the Treaty should be adjourned, I will gladly obtain the information
before we pass it, even -if we adjourn it until
to-morrow.
I may tell my honourable f riend that bis
first question does not trouble me very much,
as te possible entanglements witih Great
Britain's authorities in case a British subi ect
who is not a Canadian citizen is involved in
the precedure 'between the United States and
Canada, because hie could only be involved
through soine action of his own on Canadian
territory, and hie would be amenable te our
criminal law. Hence I cannot see that there
is any very great dificulty on that score.
As to sea-going vessels, and the importance
of fixing a minimum tonnage, of course that
.problem may be somewhat difficuit. A Customs officer may refuse te give clearance
papers because hie believes that the ve.ssel is
flot in a position to reach the port indicated
in the clearance. In the case of a bona fide
shipper that would simply involve the necessity of his producîng convincing evidence that
hie really intends to reach that port, and his
good faith could 'be shown by correspondence
which he would have. That is a matter wh'ich
will adjust itself *by general préatice. Likewise, if a vessel has cleared for Cuba and returns to another port a very f ew days after
obtaining that clearance, a second clearance
*may be refused; and I tbink that would be
a good stand to be taken by a Cuotoms officer.
If in any of those cases the ship owner or
ship master feit that hie had been unjustly
treated hie could appeal to the Department
sit Ottawa, and there establish his good standing.
That is ail the information whieh. I nan
give at t'he present moment to my henourable
friend on those three pointe.
I would flot
Hlon. Mr. ROBERTSONsuggest that the resolution be delayed at ail,
but I thought it would be interesting if my

honourable friend ceuld enlighten us on the
points named. The principle of fixing a minimum or maximum bas been pretty well established by provincial Governments, for example, in fixing the strength of beer. 1
thoughit tlie samne principle could be followed
by saying that ne boat less than a minimum
tonnage of say 50 or 100 tons should be given
any consideration as a ship suitable for departure to an ocean port.
It miglit be
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
interesting to t>his Chamber te have soine
further information on the various pointe
naimed by my honourable friend. We may
pass the resolution, but I will transmit my
honourable friend's remarks to the Minîster
of Customs and ask him te give them his
consideration.
Right Hlon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I amn sorry to hea-r my honourable friend use
the word "may" in the hypethetical case. If
a boat of whatever tonnage starts eut to-day
from a port on tihe Great Lakes destined for
Cuba, and gets hier clearance, and cornes baek
in the next three or four days and as" for
another clearance, I do not think there ought
to be any "may ber' ini th.at at ail. If that is
flot made imperative, the United States mnay
whistle for anything that may inuie te their
advantage on that side; but this is a matter
that goes further than the mere matter of
Customs officers boere and in the United States.
It is such a gross violation of the spirit of
t'le law tliat it leads te lawleasness wherever
it is known, and I think a Customs officer
who is guilty of that sort of thing ought to
get bis dismissal papers mighty sudden.
The Resolution was agreed te.

SENATE
on the 12th July, 1889, and the 13th December, 1900,
and the 12th April, 1905, and the 15th May, 1922,
which was signcd at Washington on the eighth day of
January, one thousand nine hundred and twenty-five,
and which was signed on behalf of His Majesty in
respect of Canada by the Plenipotentiary therein
named, and that this House do approve of the same.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, this is a Convention between His
Britannie Majesty in respect of the Dominion
of Canada and the United' States for the
extradition of offenders against the laws for the
suppression of the traffic in narcotic drugs.
It is, in effect, an addition to the list of
extraditable cases.
As every honourable gentleman knows, no
obligation to surrender offenders against the
law of another country exists under international law, except by special treaty agreement. Extradition treaties have been signed
between His Britannic Majesty and the United
States at various periods since 1842, notably
in 1889, 1900, 1905, and 1922, providing for the
surrender of persons against whom prima facie
evidence exists of certain crimes.
The list of
such crimes now include murder, manslaughter, arson, burglary, enbezzlement, perjury, bribery, and other specified offences.
It
is now proposed, as regards Canada and the
United States, to add to the list of crimes or
offences for which extradition may be granted,
crimes or offences against the laws for the suppression of the traffic in narcotics, of the
country making the request for extradition.
Previous extradition treaties between His
Britannic Majesty and the United States (1842,
1889, 1900, 1905, and 1922) applied to cases in
which the crime was committed, or, in the
other contingency, in which the offender was
found, in the United States or in any part
of the British Empire. The present agreement is confined to cases in which the offence
was committed in the United States or in the
Dominion of Canada, and the person so
charged is found in the Dominion of Canada
or the Unitet States respectively.
The necessity for such an agreement arises
from the elaborate organization of drug rings
throughout the world and the dimensions to
which the traffic has developed.
On this
continent there are a number of large traffickers
in narcotics in the principal cities of the
United States and also in Canada, particularly,
in our case, in Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg,
and Vancouver. It frequently happens that
while investigation is being carried on into
opeirations of persons suspected of underground importation or local distribution of
narcotic drugs, or a trial is under way, the
suspects in question slip across the border,
secure in the knowledge that they cannot be
extradited.
It is estimated by the DepartHon. Mr.

DANDURAND.

ment of Health that ten or twelve large dealers
a year manage to escape from Canadian justice
in this way, and of course the same thing
applies, on a somewhat 'larger scale, to United
States traffickers hiding in Canada.
The Canadian Department of Health and
the Narcotics Division of the United States
Internal Revenue Service work in close cooperation, by exchanging information, and
occasionally by intercepting shipments; about
a year ago, at the request of the Canadian
authorities, the United States intercepted at
New York a shipment of 100,000 ounces of
morphine, heroin, and cocaine, consigned to a
fictitious firm in Montreal.
There is, then, an urgent necessity for an
extradition agreement whieh will assist in
breaking up this traffic.
I move that the Senate concur in the
Resolution from the House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
Honourable
gentlemen, the same thought that was in the
mind of the honourabile member for Mille
Iles (Hon. Mr. David) a few minutes ago
presents itself again, that is, as to whether
the British Government is cognizant of the
terms of this Convention. It strikes me that
the British Covernment, as appears from
Article 1 of this Convention, was a party to
the Extradition Treaty to whieh this one now
proposed is to be added. It seems to me that
it may well oceur that a British subject not
a Canadian citizen may be sought by the
United States authorities, and his extradition
demanded, and under this Convention Canada
would be under obligation to deliver that
British subject to the American authorities.
It occurs to me that the British Goverment
is not altogether diSinterested in this Convention. Perhaps my bonourable friend could
clear up that point.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I would make
the same answer that I did to the first representation of my honourable friend. A person
can only be arrested for a crime committed
in the United States when ho is running away
to avoid punishment, and has taken refuge in
Canada. His extradition is sought for because ho is in the Dominion of Canada, and
ho is returned to the country from which he
comes, the United States, whatever his
nationality, whatever his name, whatever his
origin. If ho has committed a crime in the
United States and bas crossed the border, ho
is followed by American justice; he is
arrested under a warrant, and the United
States Government asks for his extradition.
Then, if a prima facie case is made before
an extradition commissioner, it is the duty

MARCU 11, 1925
of the Dominion of Canada to return the
aecused te the United States; but it is not
part of his duty to examine into nationality.
The accused is one who has committed a
crime in the United States; his extradition
is sought, and it would be no estoppel on his
part te dlaim that he came from Great Britain
or France. I am speaking within the hearing
of members of the Bar, and if I am at fault
in my reading or remembrance of the law, it
wil1 be for them to point out my errer. It is
my conviction that on a prima facie case the
courts will return such a person te the country from which he comes. Likewise, if C-anada made a demand for extradition in a case
falling under the treaty, I believe the United
States courts wouldý refuse to examine into
the origin of the person accused.
Hon. Mr. LYNCR-STAUNTON: Would
the honourable gentleman enlighten me on
one point? Was the Treaty between Great
Britain and the United States regarding the
extradition of criminals ever approved by
Parliament, or was it necessary to have it se
approved? As I recollect, Treaties are made
by Ris Majesty with foreign countries and
are not, or were not formerly, necessarily
submitted to Parliament. That was the preregative of His Majesty.
If that Treaty was necessarily submitted to
Parliament before it became ýegal, Ùunder
what authority does the Canadian Government make an extension of that Treaty?
Now that the British Empire has been split
up inte a thousand component parts, I can
hardly express myseif as I desire. If the
Treaty was originally made between te
United States and Great Britain, how can we
pateli it up by adding anything to it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The answer is
very easy. The Treaty of 1842 was made
between Ris Britannie Mal esty and the President of the United States. Under the procedure ïas it prevailed aut that time, the
Treaty covered the British Empire, because
at that time there were ne autonomous Dominions. I do net remember positively, but
I have a vague impression that the Treaty
was submitted te the British Parliament, and
that its effeet carried throughout the whole
of the British Empire. Since the Dominions
have received the power te legislate in
matters appertaining to their own domain,
the authority of the Parliament of Canada
extends to matters appertaining te Canada,
and, according to my reading of the British
North America Act, there was in esse the
power in the Dominion cf Canada te deal

l

with matters extending beyond its bordera.
Those powers were nlot utilized, but were
gradually extended according to the need,
and desires of the Canadian Parliament.
His Mai esty the King is now advised by
six or seven Cabinets in reference to matters
appertaining to those parliaments, and the
Canadian, Executive has advised His Britannie Mai esty, King of Great Britain and the
Dominions beyond the Seas, of the negotiatiens that were carried on, and has asked
him to appoint a plenipoteniary with f ull
power to sign the Treaty with the United
States in respect of Canada, se that the
instrument which is now deposited before
Parliament is an instrument signed by Ris
Britannic Mal esty, who is the same power
that signed the treaty of 1842. The Executive of this Parliament has carried on these
negotiations and bas asked His Mai esty the
King, by a Canadian Order in Council, to appoint bis delegate to sign this Treaty. Ris
Mal esty the King, recognizing the advice of
his Canadian Cabinet, bas appointed that
delegate, se that the question now before us
is the ratification by the Parliament, of
Canada of a Treaty cd Ris Mai ety the King
in respect of Canada. This, ais I see it, is
the working cf the Constitution at this time.I may add, with the consent of this Chamber-because I am out of order in addressing
the Chamber a second time on this matterthat in 1866 Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir
George Etienne Cartier crossed over with the
Federal Compact and asked the British Parlialment to adopt it as a Treaty between the
four provinces of the Est. When he reached
the ether side, Sir John A. Macdonald asked
the British Cabinet to give Canada the naine
of the "Kingdom of Canada." Re pressed
this point ardently, and at one- time he
thought hie had succeeded in obtaining that
titie for Canada. At the st moment, however, the Minister for the Colonies f elt that
there were difficultie-no>t -difficulties tb2at
would arise in London, but in the country to
the south of us, and suggested the namne of
the "Dominion of Canada." Re was afraid of
the name "Kingdom of Canada" perhaps because it seemed to imply a clearer division of
power, and because it would appear that the
Kingdom of Canada was an entity fully as
autonomous and independent as the realim of
England. The Minister was afraid of the
words, but I claim that he gave us the thing.
We speak of the Crown. The Crown hau

alone and it may mnean the King in Council.

their affection to the representative of sovereignty; and there is the Crown which represents the King in Council. The King in
Council is the real authority; he takes his
authority from Parliament, and in 1867 the
authority had passed from the King to Parliament. It was the British Parliament that
delegated a parcel of its authority to the Canadian Parliament and gave us all the powers
necessary to administer this country-to levy
taxes, to impose duties on foreign goods, even
on goods 'coming fromt the Mother Country, to
raise a soldiery, and to call to arms and organize a militia. These are the powers that
were granted by the British Parliament to the
Canadian Parliament. From that time on the
King in Council as we knew him before 1867
-the
King in Couneil for Canada-was no
more in London, but in Canada; and, although not here in person, through his delegate. the Governor General, Canada has had
the full powers of an autonomous nation and
has been really what Sir John A. Macdonald
desired it should be, namely, the Kingdom of
Canada.
I may say that I do not claim the initiation
of this policy for the present Government, because it was carried on by the Government of
which honourable gentlemen who face me
were members. When an Order in Council
was passed askine His Majesty the King to
appoint as Canadian plenipotentiary to Washington the Right Hon. Sir Robert Borden,
which His Majesty the King did, there was
initiated the policy which is now being carried on and which was recognized ýand accepted by the Conference of 1923.
It is recognized that the King can be
advised by the various cabinets of the British
Dominions respecting their own affairs. We
are sister nations. If we were not a sister
nation-if we were to submit to another
cabinet, be it in South Africa, Australia, or
London-if it were necessary for us to have
our Orders in Council revised by another
Cabinet-we would still be the subjects of
the subjects of His Majesty, and would be
inferior in status to the street cleaners of
London, who can make and unmake the
Cabinet that would be ruling over us. I claim
that through the development of our own
powers we have achieved an equality with the
Parliament of Great Britain. I repeat, we are
not the subjects of the subjects of the King.
The King, His Britannic Majesty, signs a
Treaty which adds to an old treaty which
was made by His Britannic Majesty in 1842.
I submit that Australia, South Africa. New
Zealand, are doing as we are doing., and
that iutonomy will make for greater unity in
the Empire.
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Honourable gentlemen, I am one of those who are
entirely out of sympathy with the desire to
make Canada a sister nation. I humbly
venture to think that this eternal pounding
of the idea into the people of Canada, in
season and out of season, that they are not
British subjects, but sinply part of an
association of nations for the tirne being
connected with Britain, does not make for the
continuance of the British Empire. I think
that the British North America Act was
intended to give to us, and did give, full
power to legislate with regard to Canadýian
matters, and to make bargains with foreign
countries with reference to things appertaining
to Canada and to Canada alone; and I have
never thought, and could never understand
why it was thought that it was necessary to
invoke the treaty-making power to make
those bargains. We can go to New York
to-morrow and make a bargain with the United
States to construct a canal or te lend us
85,000,000. That in no way involves the exercise of the treaty-making power. Apparently
it is the view of some people now that. although we may make a contract with a
foreigner, we may not make a contract with
a foreign government. I think we can, and
have always thought we could.
The point that I am interested in-it may
be acadenic-involves the liberty of the subject. The Canadian Government undertakes
to make a Treaty with a foreign government whereby it assumes the right to arrest
and deliver to that foreign government a
British subject who has committed no crime
under the laws of his own country. In the
ege of the law of his own country he is
innocent and has a right to his freedom; but
the Government of Canada makes a Treaty
and assumes the authority te take that man
prisoner and to carry him down to the
frontier and to deliver him over to the
foreign government. What authority has the
Canadian Government te do ttat under the
British North America Act, which is the
Constitution of this country?
The Government has authority to make laws to preserve
the peace, order, and good government of
Canada.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

But, looking at the question from a different
angle, it seems to me that there is bardly any
doubt as to Canada having this jurisdiction.

It seems ta me that, we bave. Now, if we
bave that power, it ought ta be exercised by a
certain metbod, that is ta say, by extradition,
and this, it saaems ta me, is the only power
in question in tbis Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

But to legislate rogarding the United States

The honourable gentleman drew

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

And that

Hon. N. A. BELCOURT:
Honourable
gentlemen, rny honourable friend's difficuities
seern ta be purely imaginary. The power ta
legislate in crirninal maters carrnes witb it the
power ta enact and provide ail tha incidentals
of that power. Now, there ca bie no question
that this Parliament bas bean fully vested with
ail the required authority ta doal with crirnmnal matters.
The Act of Confederation is
an Act of the Crown as well as an Act of
Parliarnent.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
The honourable gentleman assarts that.
I arn asking
for the authority.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
I arn trying ta
answer my hanourabla friand by painting out
ta hirn that not only is the Act of Confederation a delegation frorn the British Parliament,
'but it is also a. dolegation by the Crown.
Whet'her you consider the riglit ta nagotiate
Treaties as ane appertaining exclusively ta
the Crown, or wbetber you take the position that it belongs ta bath tbe Crown and
Parliament and that whenever a Treaty
is ne-otiated by the Crown it must lie submittedà ta Parliament for ratification, I say
we are arnply covered in tbis instance, lbeause
by tbe Act of Confederation tbe Crown joined
with the Briti5sh Parliarnent in giving ta this
country power ta legislata tabsolutely and
exclusive] 'v within its territory in matters of
eriminal law. That carnies witb it tbe right
ta ýmake or amend Treaties in regard ta extradition. Nobody bas evar questioned biefore this hour tbat we had the riglit ta make
extradition Treaties.

MAIUJH 11, 1925
Hon. Mr. LYNOR-STAUNTON:
Nobody
ever asserted it before.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What botter assertion could he made than the passing of an
Act itself? No assertion! Why, surely the
Act itself is the moet solemn assertion of
that right that you could thin-k of. Lt is not
merely a declaration; it is a doing of the
very thing whidh my 'honourable friend questions. And hie says that nobody b.as ever
asserted it before.
In, Vhis instance there is another answer,
which is absoluteIy conclusive, and it is this,
that in regard to this Treaty the Crown has
appointed somebody in Canada to go and
negotiate it. Surely my fhonourable friend
wiil not contend that it is necessary that this
Treaty negotiated with the United States of
America shall be ratified by the British Parliament.
Hon. Mr. LYNOH-STAUNTON:
If it
muet be ratified at ail, it muet be ratified by
the British Parliament.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But why should
it have to be, if the British Parliament and
the Crown united nearly sixty years ago to
give us power to do this very thing? 'My
honourable friend, 1 think, ýis putting up
fen-ces purely for the pleasure of knocking
them. down.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTGN: If I have
the client, the question will be brought before
t'le Court.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: WilI this apply
to sending persons out by sea as well as by
land?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I might add this.
No'body bas questioned that power. In the
Treaty of Peace, in which my right lionourable friend took a very prominent part, with
other Canadians, and at the different Iraperial Conferences which have been fheld since,
they actesi not merely by virtue of Canadian
authority, but by virtue of the direct powers
issued by the Crown. I think my honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) is living
in the past. Many things have happened in
the hast fif.ty years which have apparenthy
passed unnoticed by him.
Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlemnen, I hesitate to say what I intend saying,
because this is a very delicate question and I
have bac! no opportunity at ail to examine
it. I arn prompted only by the remarka whýich
I have heard.
I mnust say that I arn entirehy in accord
wîth the àdea of the development of our
constitutional rights. I think it is quite proper

109

that we should have in this Dominion the
power to make Treaties and sign those
Treaties, as is now being done in ail matters
affecting excilusivehy the interests of the
Dominion of Canada. I think there is no
doubt at ail that it is within. the power of
this Parliament to Pass laws which wiil enable
us ta deliver to a foreign country any person
violating its 'laws, whether hie be a British
subject or an alien; but if I understand the
question which bas been raised, by the honourable member fromn Hamilton (Hon. Mr.
Lynch-Staunton), it gars 'a litble further than
that. The Treaty which is amended bas been
passed flot by this Parlhiament, 'but by the
Parliament of Great Britsnn. Lt may raise
the question as to whether such a Treaty
shouhd be ratified by Parliament, and, if so,
hy the British Parliament or by the Canadian Parliament? I understand that is the
question.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAIJNTON: That is
the point.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: This question may be
raised under this Treaty. A persan arrested
and delivered to the United States might
question the valiclity of the Treaty.
Hon. *Mr. BELCOURT: There is a provision now in our Criminal Code making
sm'uggling a crime.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: There is
no provision that I know af in the Criminal
Code covering this point. This is net a
question of smuggling: it is a question of extraditing a man who bas committed a crime
in the United States. It has nothing ta do
with smuggling.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: Is there any partcuhar
necessity for Passing this to-day? Is there
any reason why it cannot stand until to-morrow?
Hon. Mr. DANDURA.ND: None whatever.

SENATE

One recalls that during the past three years
particularly, at eacb Session, this matter has
been brought to the attention of the Government, and an earnest request bae been made
that there be a special effort to send to this
Chamber, as early in the Session as possible,
the legisiation ceming before Parliýament. We
hear on the outside, and have indeed seen,
some indications of a prebably early preregation-that the Govornment do net desire to
bave a prolonged Session; but I think it is
only fair, and indeed proper, that we should
caîl attention to this situation, and again urge
that this flouse should flot be put in the embarrassing position that it bas occupied during the past tbreo years, of being loaded up
witb important legisiation during the dying
days of the Session.
1 tbink there are a number of important
measures whioh wilI net only menit but
demand minute inspection and careful consideration. 1 have in view particularly the fact
that last year a, vather petulant pronouncement emanated frein the Prime Minister
only an heur befere the prorogation of Parliament, that did net refleot any credit upon
this body or perbaps upon the Gevernment itself. That pronoun cernent was regarded by
tbe country at large, 1 think, as a tbreat
against the Sonate, and it was made in connectien witb delay for which, in my humble
opinion, the Goveranent itself was wholly
and solely rosponsible, the fact being that
certain important legfisiation, involving milliens of dollars, was net enacted last year
because somo of it was sent te this Chamber
within a few heurs of the time wvhon Parliament was proregued.
I therefore beg beave te suggest te my honourable friand tho leader of the Government
in this flouse that bie should cali the attention of the Goverilment te this matter.
I
feel sure that hoe bas much sympatby witb
tbe viow 1 have expressed, judging fremn the
observations that bie made on the floor of tbis
buse last year. With that sympathy. and
bis energy, we may perbaps succeed ia gettîng
the important legisiation that is te ho dealt
witb during, this Sesýsion sent te this Ch.amiber
at a reasonably early date.
lion. Mr. DANDLTRAND:
Honourable
gentlemen. we have *tic;t been speaking of
tbe Constitution which wvas granted us in
1867, and wbicb w'as largely a replica of tbat
of the Mother of Parliaments.
Ever since
1867, if one would look at Hqnsai'd as far
back as we had a Hansard-because in the
eagrly years the Senate bad ne sucb recordhoe would find the sanie complaint. There is

Mr. ROBERTSON.

be cured. We have all made the same cernplaint, and the representatives of Governments
have ahl promised te make their best efforts
te obtain early legisIation.
Now, if there is something in the working
of Parliament that prevents certain important
measures from reaching the second Chamber
at such a moment as will allow it te do its
work in a regular manner, there are but two
alternatives-for the Sonate to detain Parliament for a sufficient length of time te study
that legislatien when it cornes, and dispose
of it, or else to postpene it until the following
Session. There is no other alternative that I
can sec.
During this Session I have examined into
the legislation appearing on the Order Paper
of the House of Commons, and I bave pressed
my colleagues te send to the Sonate legislation
which dees not concorn the financial situation
and need net be initiated in the other Chamber; and I have gathered the impressien that
wo will net have as much legisiation this
Session as we have had in preceding enes.
During tbe last three years tbe varieus Departments have inundated us with legisiation
of aIl kinds. I bave representedi te my
colleagues that many amendments te the laws
relating te the varieus Departments which
appear before Parliament yearly, ceuld perbaps
be breugbt every five years, unless of a very
pressing nature. If wo cannet get the important legisiation until the very last days
of the Session, the Senate will have to choose
between adjourning that legisiatien te another
Session or going on witb it witbout regard
te the feelings of tbe Commoners wbo have
accomplished tbeir work and would like
te go beome.
lion. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Could we adjourn
legislation fromn one Session te another? Dees
net aIl business end witb the ad.journiment of
the Session?
lion. Mr. DANDURAND:
0f course, a
Bill tliat doos not pass thec Seuate muîst, to
become law, pass the two flouses in the following Session. For instance, in the case of
the Pension Bill, we passed a few clauses and
adjourned the balance.
I will mako an effort te ebtain froma each
of my colleagues a statement as te what can

and I may be in a position before the end of
this week, or possibly on Tuîesday next, te

journ or give a three months' hoist to a Bill
in this House on the ground that we have not
time to consider it, the situation is not helped
at ail, for if they brought that Bill up from
the Lower House again at the end of the Session, we would be where we were the previous Session, without time to consider it. In
the case of the Bill that we postponed practicaliy, for want of time, why is that Bill not
here now?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I can give an
answer to my honourable friend, because this
very morning I asked the Minister of Soldiers
Civil Re-establishment if he would not press
his Bill on this week. It being a money Bill,
it cannot be initiated in this Chamber. He
shrugged his shoulders and said that the
Veterans were pressing him for a hearing, and,
though his Bill was ready, he had delayed
presenting it because he was expecting a conference with those gentlemen.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Which all goes to show
that we did the right thing when we did not
pass that Bill last year, because they have
not made up their minds yet what the Bill
ought to be.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Of course, the
Minister bas his Bill of lest year, which was
the result of the work of a House of Commons
conimittee. He simply embodied the conclusions of that Committee in the Bill, which
reached us two or three days before the end
of last Session. That is the present Bill, I suppose. He did not tell me exactly that it was
on all fours with the Bill of last year, but I
understood that it was last year's Bill. As the
various Veterans' Associations wanted to make
same representations to him, and very likely
to amend that Bill, he has been adjourning
from day to day the presentation of it.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: But these Veterans, if
they get caught out again this year, will have
no cause to blame this House. They should
have been here in the early days of the
Session, or before, so that the Government
might be in a position to bring in a Bill and
give us plenty of time to consider it. The
blame is being put on the wrong people in this
matter: this House is being blamed for what
they are not at all to blame for.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have a vague
recollection that some fifteen years ago some
very important insurance legislation reached
us almost at the end of the Session, and we
adjourned the Bill until the following Session. At the third Session, as it was not a
money Bill, it was introduced in the Senate

when we had plenty of time to deal with it,
and I think that we made quite a good Act of
it.
Hon. Mr. POPE: When the Prime Minister is going through this country threatening the existence of this Chamber, threatening to curb the Senate's powers, I think it
is time that we had recognition in the other
place, and that legislation should come here
in time for our consideration. I know this
is a very old story, but when a political party,
headed by the Prime Minister, is threatening
the position of this House, I say it is time that
we notified them that if they want us to pass
legislation here they should certainly send
down their Bills in time for our consideration.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at

THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS PROTOCOL
MOTION FOR RETURN

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE
moved:

E. FOSTER

That an humble address be presented to His
Excellency the Governor Geaneral; praying that His
Excellency will cause to be laid before the Senate
a copy of the Geneva Protocol, of the report thereon
submitted by the committees of the fifth Assembly
of the League of Nations, and of the proceedings
of the said Assembly detailing the discussion and
action taken in regard thereto, and copies of all correspondence between the Government of Canada and the
Government of Great Britain or any members thereof,
in relation thereto.

Honourable gentlemen, to-day
He said:
in the city of Geneva there is a notable
gathering in continuation of the sessions of
the Couneil of the League of Nations, at
which gathering it is supposed that the Chancellor of the Government of Great~ Britain
will make a statement with reference to the
protocol and the attitude thereon of his Government and of the British Dominions. If
at Geneva there is concentrated interest these
days, and particularly this day, as to what may
be the nature of that statement and what
the future effect will be upon the Protocol,
firstly, and of the work of the League, secondly, that interest is not much less in all the
numerous chancelleries of the nations, 55 in

number, which belong to the League, and
which, to the number of 48, gave their unanimous adhesion to the perfected work of
last year's Assembly in the protocol itself.
Whether very much interest is shown in
Ottawa, or in Canada, I shall leave each one
to determine for himself; but the magnitude
of the issue and of the consequences that may
be entailed, no one who gives the merest
quantum of thought to the subject can fail to
understand and to appreciate. I am not giving
it as a matter of acrid criticism, but as an

observation, that under all these circumstances
whether the existence of a measure so hardly
come to and so thoroughly wrought out over
a series now of nearly five years, a measure in
which Canada herself is one of the nations
concerned, did not deserve at the hands of the
Government of Canada consultation and the
communication of information and possibly an
opportunity for suggestions. The Leader of the

Government has very properly declared over
and over again that he is not favourable to

committing Canada to quarrels or combinations or agreements which may entail military

action, without previous consultation of Parliament.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
That is a proper decision to take. But the
question cornes to my mind whether there
nay be a more important thing than Canada being involved in a war, and in regard
to which Parliament should be consulted.
There may be this importanti thing-that
Canada may be involved this very day in
weakening, maybe in striking down, that which
so many peoples of the world after long strivings have come to consider as high record-mark
along the line of assured peace and of freedom from war, and whether or not it would
not have been in accordance with parliamentary and constitutional procedure and democratic government that Parliament having
been in session for more than a month, there
should have been some information given and
some consultation had as to what stand Canada should take.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Waiting for England.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: I
am asking honourable gentlemen to-day if
they will kindly let me make my address. I
do hope as I go on that questions will arise
in the minds of honourable Senators, and I
would be very much obliged if they would
note them and raise them afterwards in the
course of this debate to-day or otherwise.
This is a rather important matter and someHon. Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

what invdlved, and it breaks up the line of
one's thought if interruptions are made and
questions asked, all of which questions I shall
be delighted to answer in so far as I may.
That much then, by the way.
The first point that I wish to urge upon the
attention of honourable gentlemen is this:
that we keep the Protocol distinct from the
Covenant and do not fail to give to each its
due place; that is, that we should not hold
the Protocol responsible for what is in the
Covenant. If I gather aright many of the
criticisms that are made, are not well based,
because in making a criticism of the Protocol
some actually criticize what the Protocol
in no way new or unu ual embodies,
but which bas already been embodied in
the Covenant, and to which for five years
Canada and all the other nations belonging
to the League have been pledged. We rnust
make that distinction and hold the Protocol
responsible only for the new matter it contains.
Well, then, in the first place, negatively,
the Protocol does not undertake to supersede the Covenant-not at all. It does not
propose to take the place of the Covenant.
It adds very little, if anything, to the obligations already taken under the Covenant; it
adds nothing to all the series of sanctions of
the Covenant. In fact, in one or two respects
it alleviates those sanctions by limiting conditions.
It is well, then, to keep in our minds this
firm fact, and we shall probably grasp the matter more clearly and consecutively if we go over
a little of the ground of the Covenant itself.
In the preamble of the Covenant all those
nations that became members of the League of
Nations pledged themselves not to resort to
war. That was in the very forefront of the
Covenant. All nations that belong to the
League of Nations have taken that pledge and
have undertaken to carry it out, and for five
years they have carried it out, almost, if not
altogether, in its entirety.
After the declaration not to resort to war,
the Covenant prepared the paths by which
war was to be avoided by providing for the
settlement of international disputes by other
methods than war. Let us see what those
were. The nations pledged themselves to have
recourse to arbitration, to the judgments of
the court, and to the mediation and good
offices of the Council of the League of Nations.
Those were the three media through which it
was proposed to lessen if not entirely to avoid
occasion for war in the settlement of disputes.
In the matter of arbitration, that was vo'luntary under the Covenant; in the matter of

MARCHI 12, 1925
submission to the Court, that was vé1untary
as .weil. Arbitration was provided, but it wus
for those subjects which seemed to the parties
themselves to be suseptibile of arbitration.
Resort te law was provided or was to 'be provîded by the Court of International Justice; but it was open ta the parties themseives
w.hether they would submit 1their disputes -to
that International Court. To m-ake it easier
for them, and .to 'lead the way, the Covenant
iteelf specified four different lines of subj ecte
as being particularly susceptible to reference to
the Permanent Court of Justice when it should
be formed. Firat, -there was the interpretation
of a Treaty; secondly, any question of international law; Vhirdly, any fact which, upon its
being established, snight lead to a breach of
international obligation; and fourthly, any
penalty whidh was necessary as a reparation
for such a breach of international obligation
But ini ail those cases it was for the pafties
themselves to eubmait -their case to the Court
or not as they thought, right.
Ail questions except those were to corne
before the Council of the League, and it
was arranged what course they should follow.
The two disputants were to make their statenients, their pleaders were to appear for theni,
and their case was te be thoroughly presented
to the Council. The firet duty cf the Council
when it had called them together and heard
their case, was to say to them in effeet: "Now,
gentlemen, cannot you settle this between
yourselves? Here are our good offices. We
counsel you to settle. We point out ways
by which we think you can reasonably settle
this. Will you not settle it and have the
finish of it here and now?" If the Couneil was
successful in that, it ended the case, and its
report was given accordingly. If not successfuI, the Counicil made its report and recommendations which if unanimous settled the
dispute. If, however, the Council failed to reach
a unanimous report, the case felI to the ground
and the parties were left to figh't it out. At
that point peace methods ceased and war was
perinissihie. If, however, one party to the
dispute raised the question that it was a
matter which belonged hy international law
to the domestic jurisd-ictîon of the state, then
the question had to be determined by the
Permanent Court, and if the Permanent Court
held that it was a matter which. by inter.national law feUl under the domestie juriedietion of the nation, that ended it: it gave
that decision and the case droi>ped then ani
there. There was an absolute veto upon. the
Council taking up and deciding cases which
under international law fell within the jurisdiction of the nation or of the state itself.

Now, the Protocol takes the matter up at
the point where it was left undecided because the report of Council failed of unanimity, and the parties were left perfectly free
to go to war. The Protocol cornes ini there
with its added declarations-and I may as
well give you the two primary declarations
of the Protocol. Ini the Covenant the nations
pledged thernselves not to resort to war, but
in the Protocol they declared: (1) that a war of
aggression constitutes an international crime;
(2) that arbitration should be comipulsory for
ail disputes between nations.
These were the two points where the Protocol overtopped and outdistanced and supplemented the Covenant itself, and we muet
bear those two dedlarations in mind. I say
that it struck high-water mark in the history
of the world, and that no more forward and
no more courageous statement was ever made
by the community of nations in the history
of the wide world than was made there; and
it was made, nlot ini a moment of excitement,
but as the evolution and outcome of five
years of work under the Covenant, of observation of the loopholes that still exist and
of the measures that were still necewary to
strengthen it in order that it might achieve
the great purpose for whieh At was formed.
No wars of aggression-Arbitration for ail Disputes,--these wp.re the high notes struok.
Following these deolarations the nations
say, in the Protocol: "The dispute shail not
be allowed to grow into war; it muet b.
arbitrated." So they direct the Council ta
take the matter up again and persuade the
parties to submit their case to judicial settlement or arbitroition. If that cannot be don.
and if one of the parties asks for arbitration,
then the Council has to see that arbitrators
are appointed, if possible, by consent between
the two, or without that consent, and the
process of settilement would go on to award.
But if neither of the parties asks for arbitration, the Councîl again takes the dispute into
coneideration, and if it reaches a unanimous decision of its members, excluding the representatives of the disputants, its decision is final
and must be complied with. If, however, the
decision of the Coundil fails of unanimity the.
case i. not allowed ta drop. The Couneil
then, of its own motion and by its own power,
names and organises an Arbitration Board,
submits the dispute thereto, and the. signatoiy
nations pledge themeselves te abide by thst
award and carry it out. Sa that under the.
Protocol no case goes ta war; every mae muet
he settled in the way I mention, being dWs
posed of either by arbitration or by the.
Permanent Court, or by the. Council itaelf by
unanimous vote.

EVISED M2ITION

SENATE

114

Just at this moment one other thing comes
in, and I wish to state it clearly. There is
an addition made under the Protocol which
deals with the cost of any war, or of measures
which the League of Nations take in order
to restrain the recalcitrant member if it goes
to war, by assessing the cost upon the aggressor who goes to war against the spirit
and obligation of the League of Nations.
That settles beforehand, and advertises beforehand, to any would-be aggressor nation
which breaks its obligations and goes against
the spirit of the world, as represented in the
League of Nations, that it must pay the cost,
and the community of nations outside of
itself which is in the League of Nations will
see to it that the recalcitrant member does
not impose bis will upon the other member
state which has accepted the award in good
faith and fulfilled its obligations.
I think that very fairly shows the difference
between the Protocol and the covenant on
the matter of obligations. When we come
to the matter of sanctions, I find, in talking
to an opponent of the Protocol, that often
bis objections would have been just as apt
if there had been no Protocol, being based
upon the obligations and sanctions already
in the Covenant. It is true that a great
many people have not waked up yet to the
fact that there are sanctions in the Covenant
of the League of Nations, or what those
sanctions are, and how far they lead, and
hiow they are to be carried out. But it may
be truly said that the Protocol has not added
one single sanction to those which already
existed in the Covenant, and does not call
for any sanction on malfeasance by any member of the League of Nations other than
those that are laid down in the Covenant,
and which have been accepted as obligations
by every present member of the League.
I find also that there is an inadequate understanding of the real status of the Council.
For instance, it is quite natural, when one
hears that the Council is composed of ten
men, to say: "Well, I have very strong
having my country put
objections
to
under the direction of ten men in any Council, no matter where it is, to tell it as a
nation what it has to do, and put into force
these different sanctions." It does seem extreme, looked at from that angle; but do not
let us rob the Council of its real importance
and weight. That Council is not simply ten
individuals, no matter how highly gifted,
how experienced, or how wise they may be:
that Council is ten of the foremo.st nations
belonging to the League of Nations. The
Council is not simply made up of individuals

brought together ad hoc on this occasion or
that occasion, in order to decide something
as to sanctions: it is a permanent session of
ten of the foremost nations belonging to the
League, and representing every nation that
belongs to the League, with delegated authority to carry out their wishes, which have been
expressed in the form of pledges and sanctions and obligations by those nations themselves.
Then, this also should be taken into account
-that those ten nations are not simply represented on one occasion. They are consecutive
and quasi permanent: they meet every two

of every country in the world. Between those
55 nations that belong to the League there
is constant communication and confident and
intimate knowledge and relationship.
What I want to impress upon myself and
my fellow Senators is this: that it is an extraordinary body that will take its measures
and make its recommendations, not on the spur
of the moment, but as growing out of their constant and uniform knowledge of and versatility
in and adaptation to the work which they are
carrying on; therefore it is not likely that they
will recommend measures which are impossible
or unreasonable, because they know that when
they recommend them they are the nations
which are mainly responsible for carrying them
out, and they will be very careful indeed as to
the measures they recommend when sanctions
are to be put on.

But that
can be followed by the prohibition of ail financial, commercial or personal intercourse between the nationals of the offend-ing state and
the nationals of the other members of the

Suppose a nation, say Turkey, persists and

the Council will send eut an order and
say, for instance, to Canada: "We want you
to, send over one-quarter of your fleet and a
third of your army at once ;"ý-and similarly
te other menaber states. That is not the
thing that would be done. Anyway, the
Council lias ne further power than sinaply
te advise or recommend what ouglit te be
done, and then it lies with the state itself te
do or net tihat thing which the Councit advises or recommends. In the last anatysis the

place it is the Leag.ue of Nations Council

which proposes and adlvises the mea.sures that
are te be taken. Great Britain is a member of
that Councit. It is of the essence of the
comnpact that the nations teyally ce-operate
with each other, se that then and there th-ose
nations, when making up their minds as te
what shall be done, know that it can reasonably be done, and that ecd one takes its
proper shnre.
I said a littie while ago that the Protocol
softens the sanctions cf the Covenant. It
dees in this way that whereas the Covenant
says that these sanctions are te be put on,
that the Councit is te recommend them it does
not give any leeway at att. The Protocot dees.
It says that these arrangements will be recommended with a view te the "geegraphicat position and te the situation cf the armaments
of each nation in tic Leagiie." In that casc
Great Britain, being a member cf the Coundil,
and a prominent member, is at the centre cf
things, as te what it is recommended te do
in the first place, and therefore what is feasibte
and right te be done. Anyway I do net think
Canada sieuld take the bit in hier teeth snd

Imagine these ten nations at Geneva tooking

is net thinkabte that she weuld recommend
that an unreasonabte thing shoutd be asked
from New Zealand, or froin Canada, or from.
Australia. She is there, and that reasonable
guarantee is there that nothing unreasonable
wcutd be demanded.
But suppose you take that mitigating clause
cf the Protocol into consideration. What
demand could the Coundil cf the League cf
Nations make upon Canada? She bas ne fiset.
Sic lias a fraction cf a standing army and a
smati militia. But take into account aise the
geographical position. Where may this trouble
break out? It may be a war of Hungary
against, we will say, Rumania. A portion of
territory was taken frem Hungary and now
c onstitutes a portion cf the state cf Rumania.
Lt might be that Hungary woutd puai for the
possesion 'of tiat territory and, despite all
these sanctions, might go te, war withi Ru mania.

would naturally look toe for turning Hungary

vessels could keep open the ports cf Rumarna.

SENATE
Similar possibilities would apply to the vast
nlajority of the different nations amongst
whom wars might break out. Each one has
to be judged upon its own geographical
situation and environments These would
point to the measures that are to be taken,
and by whom.
I do nlot wish to labour that point further.
I cited merely one instance or two with
reference to it, in order to Tead our minds
along the practical lines of what might be
supposed to take place in the carrying out
and in the imposition of these different
sanctions.
Perhaps it might be well to state here one
other thing that thc Protocol bas done, in the
way of definition and clarification, because
this has been the chief purpose of the Protocol.
What constitutes an aggressor, and who is to
form the judgment as to who is the aggressor?
Under the Covenant that was a duty which
fcil upon the Council, and a decision could
be reached only by an unanimity of agreement amongst the members of the Couincil.
Anyway, it was a very invidious task to, throw
upon the Council, and it was also in some
maasure a dangerous power to put into its
hands. The Protocol overcoines that by
In the definitions,
defining an weressei
nearly cvery possible case is compassed, and
only in some mere fraction of cases, if any,
is the final duty thrown upon the Council of
the League of Nations.
An aggressor, for instance, is anyone who
resorts, against the covenant, to war against
another rnember of the League of Nations.
When, for the purposes of shielding and
restricting from war, delimitization zones are
laid out between nations which have not yet
become very friendly towards each other,
and placed undýer the care of the League of
Nations, as they may be, any nation who
violates those delimitization zones is an
aggressor. Then, any nation is an aggressor
who refuses to submit his dispute to arbitratien, or to the Court, or to the Council. Any
nation is an ag-gressor who, when an award
or decision bas been given, refuses to carry
it out or makes war upon the other party,
who submits to and accepts the award or
decision.
Thus the way is made plain for the League
of Nations and the Council. The aggressor
is defined, and it becomes an easy matter
then to direct the penalties and carry out the
sanctions. But if there be any case at al
which is not defined and cornes to the Council,
thpri the Council bas to dpcide that by a
unanimous vote. But, whilst it is deciding
that question, the Protocol hedges around
the two parties to the dispute by what are
Hon. Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

reaily armistice conditions, which. must take
effect between the two and must be kept
inviolate until the dispute is ended; and any
nation which, under those circumstances, and
hefore that decision ie given, or immediately
after, goes to war, is an aggressor nation.
Anyway, the Protocol bas lifted a difficulty
out of the way and has made clear what was
a very troublesome piece of business for the
Council under the Covenant.
The Protocol, as I said at the first, is not
meant to supersedýe the Covenant. It is really
meant to clarify and strengthen it in these
ways of organization and of definition, and it
is the bounden duty of every signatory to
support the incorporation of those amendments into the covenant itscîf, so that in
the end we may not have two documents
which are confusing, as they are now, but
may have one document, the Covenant, as it
would be amended by the Protocol.
I do nlot wish to take up too much tinae.
and I arn hopeful that my introductory remarks will lead to a thoroughly well-informed
and intelligent discussion of this great question; for it is a great question. But there are
two or three objections with whieh I wish to
deal briefly.
The first is the question of the status quo.
Men say to me, "I do nýot like this Protocol."
"Why?" "Because it says there must be
no such thing as aýggressive warfare, and consequently you are arranging a document, and
putting the League of Nations behind it,
which makes it necessary that for ail time
to come the exact boundaries of the present
states in Europe must be kept as they are."
That status quo is not made by the Protocol:
the status quo was made by the Peace Conference and was embodied in the Covenant. Article 10 puts it as plainly as can
be. So do not blame the Protocol for that.
We have been living five years under that
status quo as embodied in the Covenant,
and now 1 ask you, as reasonable men, what
else could have heen done but to guarantee the sacredness of boundaries and the
political existence of the new states which
were set up by the Peace Conference? Can
you tell me? What else could have been
done? Where would any one of those succession states be to-day if they had not been
guaranteed that when the Peace Conference
set themn up, with their metes and bounds,
they would be protected in those metes and
bounds? Otherwise there would have been no
security; there would have been almost îmmediate chaos.
",Bu.t," says someone, "they cannot always
exist." It is not necessary that they Èhould

MARCH 12, 1925
always exist. But there are only two ways
of changing them. One is to change themn
by the arbitrament of war; and the moment
you commence that you bhave a Europe, and
maybe a world, in chaos. Poland bas her
30,000,000 people. Away back in history she
was a free nation. Then came the division,
and then ail the multiplied suifferings of a
nationality ground under the heel of three
tyrannous powers. Now -the spirit of old Poland cornes back and is incarnated in 30,000,000
people, with theïr boundaries set. Are you
going to al]ow any one nation in Europe to
break up these boundaries? Do you expect
that it cao be done without an internecine
war? And who would divide the spoils?
Similar considerations apply to CzechoSiovakia-to ail the succession states. How
can you change them? Certainly flot by war.
But in the Covenant itscif there is a way
opened up, and in the advancing good feeling
and syrnpat'hetic sentiment and reasonable
comrnunity of ideals of the world of nations
there is hope that, in the future, whatever
there is that may tend to affect the ultimate peace of Europe and of the World
may be in one way or another softened and
reduced te conditions which %vill be more
equable and more in favour of rectifications
along the lines of peace. Article 19 cf the
Covenant opens up the way, and t'he Covenant
imposes obligations and duties te protect the
rights and soften the biardships cf minorities;
and the rnultiplied peaceful and soothing influences of the League of Nations will bring
the nations more closely together;, and if in
the years cf the future-net new-it cames
te bie feit aod known that there are inequalifies and differences which it would be better
for the nations te overcome cf their own
good-will and by the advice cf their sister
nations, we may look for an improvement.
'But yeu cannot look for it in the din and
barrer of warfare. Te atternpt that. or ta
leave it open te that. would, as I have said,
bring chaos inte Europe and probably anather
great world war.
Then, there is the Russian problem.
People say: "But Russia is net in the League
of Nations. What is going ta happen if
Russia refuses to cerne inta the League and
determines ta win back thase territaries whieh
she formerly possessed, however paarly she
ruled them?" You do flot get out of that
impasse whether you have a Covenant or
Protocol or do net. Russia is liable 'ta corne
back if you have ne Protocol, or il you had
ne Covenant. But if ever she atternpted
to corne back agaànst those countries which
have now obtained their liberties and have

117

had their metes and boundis set, it ceuld be
done oniy at the cost of a Eurepean war.
Russia may say: "I want Lithuania, I wa.nt
Esthonia, I want Latvia, and I want rny strip
cf PoIand." What dees that mean? It means
that Russia would then, if allowed, march
straight inte Poland and she woiild be neighboi-rs, clieek hy jowl, with 60,000,000 Germans who have net yet learned ta love ithe
French as brothers should love each other.
Now, whether you have a Protocol or not,
such an attempt as that on the part of Russia
would inevita'bly lead ta war. Does the
Protocol help te lessen the danger? I contend that it dees, because Russia sees the
situation in full. If the Protocol passes and
under it the 55 nations loyally co-operate
with each other, Russia knows tihat an atitempt
of that kind on her part would be daomed
te faêlure. Dees the fact of the Protocol
make it less likely that Russia would rush
inte that kind of warfare? 1 think it does,
with ail the sanctions and aIl the mighty
massing of power. Russia is, after aIl, but one
country in the world, and is not economically
or financally able te go very far in the
sustenance of war against sudh odds. Therefore I take it that the Russian prohlema
would be easier.
But let us consider the situation as it related te the British Empire. Russia may attack on the east, or may attack an the west.
Fer years past the British Empire has been,
and probably àt wi-Jl be for years ta oame,
within the shadow of a menace from Russia
in the Far East. Without the Protocol, if
Russia attaeked parts of the British Empire
in the East, the British Empire alone would
have te repel the attack; but with the Protecol and its goodwill and its loyal co-operatien, if Russia atitacked the Brtish Empire in
the East, ail the nations of the League would
array thernselves with Great Britain against
Russia. If seerns te me that the RusWan
perdl is restriioted and minimized, and flot enlarged.
TFen. there cornes the Empire side of this
matter. Here we are, outside Dominions and
a Mothor Country. Will this Protoco], if if is
established and becomes workaible, ýhel~p in
keeping ani rnaking firmer those relations
that exist betwecn us, or will it have the
effect of disturbing those relations and weakeoing themn and rnaybe of destroying them?
Let us -carefully look at that question. We
Overseas Dominions have been memibers of
the League of Nations fer five years; we have
had upon us ahl those obligations for five
years, just as Great Britain bas. At any tirne
within those five years, if sanctions had been
calird for. we should have had to have taken

li8

our responsibilities. And why sbauld we not?
Does Canada have great aspirations to wear
a national name and to pride herseif upon
her independence in ail ber affairs, and ber
status as a nation, and does she propose to
have it ail without any responsibilities? If she
is going to be a nation, she must grow to a
nation's stature and take ber obligations
as a nation. And 1 do not think sbe objeets
to doing that: I do not think sbe is in the
position of wanting- to eat ber cake and bave
it as well, and saying: "I1 want to take ail of
tbe adva.ntages, and none of t.he burdens."
Is it or is it not of advantag-e to Canada?
Is Canada in favour of aggressive warfare?
Whom does she propose to attack? In any
disputes wbicb may arise between ber and the
United States, is Canada looking forward to
baving full liberty to march over and settie
the matter by war? If she bas trouble with
Japan, is sbe anxious to keep berself free
to fight out the issue? Or does she fear trouble
witb the Eskimos in tbe far nortb, and desire
to keep berself free to marcb ber army tbîtberward? Surely, of ail nations in tbe world,
Canada is tbe last that wants to keep open
tbe possibility of aggressive warfare. Sbe
has everytbing to lose by aggressive warfare and everytbing to gain by its being
banned from the face of the eartb. Witbout the Protocol and witbout the Covenant,
in a dispute between berseîf and tbe United
States, she would have to depend on berself. In a dispute witb Japan she would
bave to depcnd on berself. If she still remained British, as I believe she always will,
she would bave the advantage of belp from
the Britisb power; but outsîde that sbe would
not bave the belp of the world of nations.
But under the Protocol in any aggressive
warfare made bv any otber country in the
world upon Canada, the migbt of tbe League
of Nations w'ould be loyally co-opora ting in
her defence and support.'
Surely C3anada~ would have notbing to fear,
in the first place, by a declaration against
aggrossive war, and, in the second place, a
declaration in favour of settling disputes by
arbitration and peaceful means. Wbat other

So, wben you corne to analyse it, take for

And so for the Britisb Empire: it is hiable

under the Protocol sometbing ta gain and
nought ta Jose-that wbenever it is attacked
by an aggressor, it bas at its side tbe accordant and loyal support of other nations belonging to tbe League.
And now one word witb reference to immigration. N-lo later than tbiýs marning I read
in one of tbe despatcbes wbat seemed ta be

was especially an-xiaus for, witb regard to ber

MARCHI 12, 1925
Overseas Do'minions and herself, was the rigit,
ta contrai their own immigration. Why, that
is the clearest af all tenets af international
law-that the contrai of immigration-wha
shall enter your front door and go out at
your back door-is within the will af the
master aI the house. Japan has neyer con,tested that; no nation that I know of has
ever contested that. Japan practices it taday in the case of China, and Japan does
not abject ta that as a proposition. It does
seem odd that s0 much space should be
given ta the enunciation af a fear on the
part af Great Britain and lier Overseas Dominions that the Protocol would deprîve tliem
of their contrai of immigration. Surely on
that score we have no trouble.
I arn gaing ta read ta you what was given
as the British legal statement on that amendment as it now stands with reference ta the
j urisdiction of a country aver its awn domestic
affairs. Sir Cecil Hurst, who was the legal
adviser of the Foreign Office at. the time this
was being discussed, was asked by the British
Delegation ta give themn an opinion upon it
This is what lie gave:It le the understanding of the British Delegation

the Covenant as it existe to-day, and we do not
add ta thema by this teat.

I could quote scores of opinions froin British juriscansults a'long the saie line, but this
is sufficient to show -the trend.
There is only one little thing in the whole
aI the Protocol that troubles me, and I do
not believe it is mucli of a trouble.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Before my honourable fricnd resurnes lis seat, would lie tell
us why it is that the British Governilient is
hiesitating apparently a great deal witlh regard
ta the nature and effect of the Protocol, and
apparently is not prepared ta accept it?
Riglit Hlon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I think my honourable friend probably knaws
'as mudli about that as I do. 1 could not
hazard an opinion. Neither in the British
Bouse of Parliament or elsewhere lias the
British Clovertm-ent as yet stated through
Mr. Chamberlain what is the nature of its objections. To-day may bring out something
of that-I do not know. But I will tell
you what is significant. One cannat take
up a United States newapaper whidh die-

cusses this question, or scarcely any other

paper from a f oreign country, in which it is
flot stated with apparent conviction that the
British Government is hesitating because of
the opposition of the Overseas Dominions
Now, 1 do flot knowv
to the Protocol.
whether that is sa or not. We will know by
and by. 1 think we ought to have known
bel ore.
There is just one point I was a littie
doubtful about and cannot clear up in my
awn mind: that is, as to what would lie the
position of a member after it had gone to
the Court, where the question of domestic
jurisdiction was raised by the opponent state
-say an immigration question-and had been
turned down an it, and then came again ta
the League of Nations under Article il and
put its plea in this way: "There is yet flot
a good feeling between us and aur sister state,
and we call your attention to the f act and
ask yau to notice it and consider it, and ta
do something if you can ta alleviate the situation." The Council has no authority at al
to reopen a question as ta juriadiction on
immigration, which was decided by the Permanent Court. What it can do is simply ta
use its gaod offices ta smoath over relations
between those countries, if possible, ta prevent recurring troubles between the two.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Could it not take
it up again hy unanimous consent?
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Once a decision is given they cannat traverse
that decision; and there we remain at the
present time. If the Council on that last
notice by the state says :" Na, we cannat have
anything ta do with the jurisdiction question: that lias been settled: ail we can du is
ta try ta make things as agreeable as passible between you," I do not know what is
the position of that state which has been
turned down by the Court and which dues
not get redress from the Cauncil. I would
like ta see that mnade mare plain. You see,
the opinions of Sir Cecil Hurst and others
are along the same line. Ot-her opinions are
that it then miglit possibly be justified in
going ta war.
My position with reference ta the Protocol
is flot an extreme one. I do not think that
humanity in its mast concentrated form ever
made a perfect piece of work. It makes a camparatively perfect and workable arrangement.
The Protocol is a resuit af five years' experience and travail towards a great objective, which is permanent peace and the elimination of war. It embadies conclusions alter
five years af experience. It may be that

SENATE
there are some things. maybe several things,
about it which could be made better by
another year's consideration, and by an examination of objections such as wil come,
and a trial to obviate them, or to find methods
somehow or other of bettering them in order
to make it as nearly perfect as possible.
My impression is that neither to-day nor
later will the British Government kick over
the Protocol. Neither do I think the Overseas Dominions have taken that position.
What I do hope and think and believe will
take place is that the matter will be postponed, and that suggestions, convelrsations
and amendments will take place, and that at
the next yearly meeting of the League of
Nations at Geneva tho matter will come un
for review.
I have faith to believe that
these two declarations against aggressive warfare and in favour of arbitration for the
settlement of all disputes. having once been
thrown aloft for a weary world to gaze upon
and gather hope from, will never be taken
down. It may take more time than we think
just now, but ultimately the great objective
will be achieved.
Now, I want to read to yon, in conclusion,
the closing words of Dr. Benes, the Minister
of Foreign Affairs of Czecho-Slovakia, wh>
was the rapporteur of the third cornmittee.
when he laid this report finally before the
Assemblv:
Our purpose was to niakze war impossible, te kil
it, to annihilate it.
To do this, we had to create

a system for the pacifie settlenent of all disputes
which might etver arise.
In other words, it meant

the creation of a systen of arbitration from which
no international dispute, whether juridical or political,
could escape.
The plan drawn up leaves no loophole; it prohibits wars of every description and lavs
down that all disputes shall be settled by pacific
means.

But this absolute character which applies to the
system of arbitration should also apply to the whole
of the schemîe, in regard to all questions of principl.
If there were one single gap in the systeme, if the
smsallest opening were left for any measure of force,
tise ihole s tn
would coilapse.
To this end arbitration is provided for every kind
of dispute, and aggression is defined in such a way
as to give no cause for hesitation when the Council
has to take a decision.
These reactions led us to fill in the gaps in the
Covenant, and te define the sanctions in such a way
that no possible means could be found of evading
then, and that there should be a sound and definite
basis for the feeling of security.
Finally, the Conference for the Reduction of Armaments is indissolubly bound up with this whole systemi;
there can be no arbitration or security without disarmsamssent, nor can there be disarmament without
arbitration and security.
The peace of the world is at stake.
The Fifth Assembly has undortaken a work of
world-wide political importance which, if it succeeds,
is destined profoundly to nodify present political conditions. This year great progress in this direction has
been made in our work.
If we succeed, the League

of Nations will have rendered an inestimable service
to the whole modern world. Suoh success depends
partly upon the Assembly it-self and partly upon individual Governments.
We submit to the Assembly
the fruit of our labours; a work charged with the
highest hopes. We beg the Assembly to examine our
proposals with care, and to recommend then to the
various Governnents for acceptance.

Those two reports, one by Benes and the
other by Politis, were accepted and embodied
unanimously by the 48 nations represented at
the League Assembly at Geneva.

The idea that Canada should go ahead of Great
Britain and endorse the Protocol is of course absurd.
It might place Great Britain in an awkward position,
and make Canada look ridiculous.

It seems to me that England is not very
much in favour of the Protocol, as far as we
can see, but is simply trying to pass the buck
to the Dominions, and saying: "We cannot
say anything about that now; we have to
consult the Dominions."
There were many other occasions when
England made propositions without consulting
us. Why should they consult us more to-day
than they did then? Only the other day,
at Lausanne, they made a Treaty and did
not consult us at all, and the Prime Minister
of this country said, "We wili have nothing
to do with it." Well, he can say that, but
to make sure on this matter I took the trouble
of writing to Mr. Lloyd George, who has
been Prime Minister of England and ought
to know something of that sort of thing.
I asked: "Do you think it vill make any
difference with the Lausanne Treaty whether
Canada signs or not?" He wrote back and
said: "No, I don't think it makes any difference; I think the Treaty was finished when
King George and his Government ratified it;
but of course it is open to Canada to make
an independent Treaty with Turkey." People
seem to forget that we are at war with
Turkev. I do not forget it, because I had
a son who was near the Turkish guns for
nine months. As we did not participate
in the Treaty at Lausanne, we are still at
war with Turkey. Some people say that
we are a nation-that we sign Treaties. Well,
the best thing we could do would be to send
somebody over to Turkey to sign that Treaty,
otherwise we will still remain at war. It does
not hurt us much, and I suppose members
of this House do not recognize that we are
still at war with Turkey.
Now, the Protocol is an amplification of
Artidle 10, or I take it to be such. If Article
10 is really what it says, I do not know but
that I might be in favour of the League of
Nations, because then there would be something in it worth while. That is to say, the
League of Nations would create a super-state,
a state that would have an army and a navy,
like a court with a sheriff, to execute its
judgments. In international matters an army
and navy are the sheriff.
Peace is based on good-will, and that is
all very well, but the League seems to be
made for angels, and not for men as we know
them. If this Protocol would amplify Article
10, and give it more strength, as the right
honourable gentleman says it would, where
would the Right Hon. Charles Doherty come
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

in? When he went to the League of Nations,
he was the one who proposed to strike out
Article 10 absolutely. But that did not carry,
though there was a great deal of discussion
on it.
Then our own Sir Lomer Gouin went there,
and at first he got along beautifully. He proposed an interpretation of Article 10 to be
embodied in the Covenant, an interpretation
according to his liking, to make the Article
say what it did not say; for there would be
no use for an interpretation which would
make the article say what it actually did say.
Whenever lawyers desire to insert an interpretation clause, the purpose is to make the
document say something other than what
people read in it. However, it went through
and was referred to a committee, and the
newspapers said that it had been carried. Then
it came back to the Assembly. But, lo and
behold, of the 55 nations in the Assembly-if
there were 55-all were in faveur of it except
one. And which one was that? The representative of Persia.
Well, evidently the
representative of Persia was put up by one of
the big Powers.
The right honourable gentleman (Riglit
Hon. Sir George E. Foster) has harped and
harped upon those 55 nations.
What are
those 55 nations? I claim, honourable gentlemen, that there are in this world only eight
nations that might be called
independent
sovereign states. There are Great Britain,
China, Japan, Russia, Germany, France, Italy,
and the United States of America. Those
are the eight nations. As for the others, well,
they exist by good-will, provided there is not
a squeal out of them. These little nations
are just the ones that we hear of as flocking
to Geneva, because there they can assemble
with important statesmen. Nay, even colonies
like ours go there; and, upon my word, our
statesmen, inhaling the balmy breezes of Lake
Leman and sipping the sparkling wine of
France, think whilst thbey are there that they
are really representing a sovereign state.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
The honourable
gentleman is leaving out the Irish.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The Irish are there
too, and I trust to them to break up the
Covenant.
Everybody knows that in the world there are
just 1.600 million people. That is the number
Great
you find given in any geography.
Britain has 400,000,000. China has about the
same number. There is already half of the
world's population. Japan has 100,000,000.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
China has how many?

MARCH 12, 192M
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It is said ta have
between three and four bundred million. The
estimates vary. We are told it is very bard
ta ascertain the population. Some geographies
say tbere are more people than that, anid some
say there are less. Let us assume the population is between three and four bundred
million. I arn talking only in millions.
Russia has 175,000,000. Tbat is the population given by the geograpbies before tbe war;
but during the war, and under the magnificent
rule they bave in Russia, the Bolshevik rule,
they must have lost a very large number of
people. Tbey have massacred a great many
of their own people under that beautiful
system of Bolsbevism. On the other hand,
there is the natural increase ta offset that.
However, I have put down the number stated
in the geographies175,000,000. Tben, there
is Germany with 70,000,000, France with 40,000,000, Italy with 35,000,000, and finally the
great republie ta the soutb. the United States
of America, with 120,000,000; making a total
of 1,340,000,000 out of tbe 1,600,000,000 in tbe
world. So tbose eigbt are the nations tbat
have some real say, and have the money.
People talk about Poland. Well, wbere is
the currency of Poland to-day? It is a very
fertile country, as everyone knows, but it
bas a people wbo apparently could neyer
govern tbemselves very well. We remember
that Poland was once a great country, wben
King Louis XV of France, a great King, was
glad to marry the daugbter of tbe King of
Poland; but the Poles do not seemn ta bave
progressed, and there is a spirit of carelessness
amongst tbem.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
v~ery well just now.

Tbhey are doing

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Sa much tbe better.
I am glad of it.
If you take 1,340,000,000, the population of
those eigbt nations, from the 1,600,000,000 in
the world, ail you bave left is 260,000,000,
divided amongst 46 nations. The British
Empire may be considered as seven nations.
Taking them out of the 55, we bave 48 nations
left. If we divide 260,000,000 amongst those
48, we find an* average population of 5,500,000.
Yet we hear a great deal about 55 nations.
Persia is one of themn, and it bas not paid its
fees ta the League of Nations for I do nat
know how long. Then there is Liberia. I
would like ta know how many white men
there are in Liberia? That is in tbe League
of Nations and is counted as one.
People talk about arbitration and about
the nations minding tbe League. How can
they talk in that way in the face of what
happened at Corfu? There was Mussolini

12i

bombarding Corfu. If ever there was an
attack, a brutal attack, it was that. What did
the League of Nations do about it? They
tried to remonstrate, but Mussolini absolutely
refused arbitration, and told Sir Erie Drummond: "If you insist an arbitration, if you
attempt ta interfere with us, we will withdraw
altogether from the League of Nations." A
f ew weeks later Sir Erie Drummond- left
Geneva and went over there and explained
to Mussolini that he might do just as he
pleased, provided Italy would remain in. It
is a sort of go-as-you-please arrangement, you
can see.
Another thing we are tolid is that the League
of Nations is going ta decide who is the
aggressor. Who began the war? That is somnething that nobody seems ta be able to find
out. The Germans say now that it was the
French who started it. We are reminded of
La Fontaine's fable of the wolf and the sheep.
According ta the wolf, it was the sheep that
was the aggressor. At any rate, once the
League of Nations bas declared a certain
country ta be an aggressor, what is going
ta happen? Ail the expenses of the war are
going to be oharged to the aggressor. We
have won the late war, and there was no
doubt about Germany being the aggressor, and
the whole world was in league against Germany. Are we collecting much fromn Germany?
Have we collected much in the past fiye
years? And will they pay? No.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The Germans have
overpaid the first instalment that they agreed
ta pay.
Houn. Mr. CASGRAIN: If the honourable
gentleman is satisfied with the collection, very
well.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is the fact.
lion. Mr. CASGR AIN: Then, why are the
French kicking so much, complaining that
they cannot get any reparations? Take up
any French newspaper from the other side
and vou will see nothing else. According ta
the Frenchi newspapers, the whole trouble is
that France bas not received any reparations.
It might afford themn same comf art if the honourable gentleman would assure them that
they had been paid, though they neyer knew
it.
Would honaurable gentlemen be surprised
ta know that there are more white people
outside the League than there are in it? That
is a broad statement ta make, but it is true.
There are 55 nations in the League, but they
are mastly blacks. I bave the figures here

He said: Honourable gentlemen, this is a
short Bill, and the explanation of it 1s as

During last session John Henry
Kirkwood applied to Parliament for a Bill of
Divorce. The Bill was recommended by the
Senate Committee on Divorce, but through

been evidence.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: What is the effect

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: It all refers to the

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend will remember that this is introduced
as a public Bill. I do not see how he is going
to arrange for the proof. The Bill will go
before the Committee of the Whole.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Yes, that is
quite truc.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I think my honourable friend had better let it stand.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
After the
second reading I will move that it be referred

Houses of Parliament in that form. The purpose of the present Bill is to correct the
clerical error of last session by substituting the
name "John" for the name "James."
Clause 2 of the Bill makes it retroactive
to the 19th of July, 1924, the date of the Royal
Assent to the Bill of iast Session. This is
necessary owing to the fact that the petitioner

MARCH 12, 1925
make about the motion now before the House,
and have no desire at ail to offer any captious 'criticism. Yesterd4ay I was a littie
puzzled to know whether we were legislating
in the right of Canada or were simply passing
a resolution, which you might eall a friendly
one, which would operate as notice that we
were consenting and agreeing to what was done
under and hy virtue of Imperial legisiation.
I do nlot know where we get the legal authority to make a Treaty of a Convention in
our own right, nor can I quite see what is the
legal effeet of merely passing a vote of this
kind. The easiest way I have of getting at
the matter is to go back and see how this
was done ten or fifteen or twenty years ago.
As I understand it, under the Extradition
Act of 1870, which took the place of the old
Extradition Act of 1842, and which is still
operative, although it may have been amended
in somne small particulars, when a Convention
was made with a foreign country in reference
to the extradition of criminals, the Imperial
Governmnent would pass an Order in Council
setting out the terms of the Conventionthe crimes for which men could be taken out
of the country and for which we could dlaim
extradition fromn the foreign country. That
Order in Council had to be laid hefore the
Imperial Parliament within some ten or fifteen days of the opening of the next Session.
and also had to 'be published in the London
Gazette, a publication correspondîng to our
Canada Gazette. When that was donc it had
the force of law.
What I ýwould like to know about this is
whether the Convention that we are asked
to approve was brought about by proceedings
under the Act of 1870. In other words, who
authorized our Minister of Justice to go to
Washington? Was it the Canadian Government in its own right, or was it His Maiesty
King George on the advice of bis Imperial
Executivýe? If Mr. 'Lapointe went to Washington on appointment from His Majesty the
King, he would occupy exactly the same position as would Mr. Balfour or Lord Bryce, and
would have perfeotly good standing.
Now the Convention has been made. Hau
it been passed by Order in Council of the Imperial Governmeflt, and has it heen gazetted
in the London Gazette? If it has not, I do
not quite well see how it bas become effective. I can understand very well why the
British Government should say to us: "The
power is here in the Imperial Governent;
we will consult with you, and if you have any
suggestions to make we will appoint your
man and let himn arrange your Convention '
then we will pass the Order in Council and

1:61

puhlish it in the Gazette. You can then laY
it before your Parliament for approval or disapp-oval. If youx Parliament expresses its
disapproval we will not gazette it; if it expresses approval, the thing goes." What has
been done is perfectly legal up to the time
of rnaking the Convention; it is a sort of
modus vivendi; but 1 do nlot understand that
there is any Imperial Act changing the British
North America Act and enahling us to take
this Convention and put the stamp of law
upon it. I would like to know from, the
Leader of the Government how Mr. Lajpointe
came to go to Washington. Was there an
Order in Council of this Government? If
there wvas, was it the only order? Has there
been anything donc in England, and if so,
what?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I can only give
my honourable friend the officiai knowledge
that has been imparted to me. It is that an
Order in Council has been passed by the
Canadian Cabinet asking his Majesty the King
to give authority to somebody to sign a
His
Convention with the United States.
Majesty the King has been pleased to appoint
the present Minister of Justice to represent
him, and to sign this Convention. That being
so, I do nlot see that there is any difficultyexcept that we may examine into the constitutional phase of it-in accepting the docuIt is His Majesty, in

that is asked of the Canadian Parliament is
that it give its approval to the Convention
itself-to the art performed by the delegate
of His Majesty the King of Great Britain and
of the Dominions beyond the Seas. My honourable friend thinks that under the Act of
1870, which forms the basis of the extradition
rights between the UTnited States and Canada,

other things, the printing of the notice of this

of the Governinent to the faict that the British
Goverunient neyer made a Treaty under the
authority cd this Ac.t with any f oreign Governrnent regarding extradition of criminals.
Ail tbey did was to make an arrangement,
and that arrangement was crystallized in an
Order in Couneii, and was authorized by
statute of the Anierican Governinent or other
foreign Governnent. lt went through the
saine procedure: they passed -an Act of theif
Legisiature, or ellse had sorne Order in Council-if they make such things over thereauthorized by statute. The clause whieh lias
just been ýread begins witih the wordà, "Where
an arrangement has been made with any
foreign state," etc.
Now, there la nothing in this Act requiring
that agreement ta be submhitted to Parliament
S-9

for its approval-that is the point: we are
simply inventing a new practice here. It has
ta be laid on the Table in the Huse aif
Parliament ia England for approval. But that
is not required under this Act. Why, then,
shouldthere be any approval by us?
Hon. Mr. BEJIQUE: I wouïld like ta call
-attention ta a phase aof the Imperial Act ta
which reference bas been made, whieh should
be borne in mind. Lt is section 18 of chapter
5 of the Statutes of 33-34 Victoria, frorn which
extracta have already been read:
18. If by sny lsiw or ordinance, made before or
after the passing of this Act by the legisiature nf
any British possession, provision is made for carryin-g
in effeot within such possession the surrender of
fugitive criminals who are in or suspected of being
in such British possession, Her Majesty may, by tbe
Order in Counicil applying this Act, in thse case of
any foreign State, or by any subsequent ,yrder, either
susapend thse operation withtn aoy such British possession of bhis Act, or of any part therecf, sn fer as it
relates to such foreign State, and so long as such law
or ordinance continues in force there, and o longer.

There is another direction, but I need not
further quote.
Then, if we refer ta chapter 155 of the
Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, we find in
section 4:
Io thse case of any foreign State
which thse application to the United
Act of thse Parliament of thse United
in the year 1870 and intituled "An
the Law relating to thse Extradition

with respect to
Kingdnyn nf the
Kingdom, psssed
Act for amending
of Criminals."

-tha.t is the Act in question-and any Act or Acts amending the same, is made
subject to sny limitation, condition, qualification or
exception, etc.

Now, on referring ta the Orders in Council
passed in England under the Imperial Act,
chapter 52 of 33-34 Victoria, I find, for instance, in the Statutes of 1902, which contain
one of those Orders in Council, this:,
Whereas by the Extradition Acte, 1870 to 1895, it
wss aingst other thiogs enacted that,, where an
arrangement bas beau made-

Then it quot-es from, the Imperial Act, and
after citing the Convention it goes on:
And whereas the ratifications of the said Convention

Now, therefore, His Majesty, by and with thse advice
of His Privy Council, snd in virtue ni the authority
committed to Him by the said îrecited Acta, doth

adian Act? By the statute, or by Order in
Council, or publication in the Gazette?

-and entitled "An Act respectmng the Extradition of
Fugitive Criminals " shall continue in force there, and
no longer.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I think the Canadian
Act provides for the bringing into, force by
Order in Couýncil, and it could be a Canadian
Order in Council.

Therefore it seems to me that the position
is this. An Imperial Aet was passed in 1870
applying to the Britiýsh Empire at large, but
with the restriction that if any of the British
possessions chose to legisiate for themselves,
the Act would flot apply to those British possessions: it would be the Aet of the British
possessions that would apply; and that is what
hias taken place. We, having passed an Act
of our own, the matter is governed by the Act
which was passed by us, whi-ch is chapter 155
of the Revised Statutes of Canada. Then of
course the question arises, as a matter of
procedure. whether the Convention was entered into regularly. The question cornes up
as to the mode of pubishing the Convention
-whether it should be by Order in Council
puhlished here or by Order in Council published. in England.
lion. W. B. ROSS: Is the Act you have
just been reading from a Canadian Act or
an Imperial Act?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

It is an Order

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I read frorn the Imperial Act to which the honourable memnber
referred. Then 1 referred to our own Act
wvhich, by section 18 of the Imperial Act, is
to supercede the Imperial Act se, far as thiat
is concerned. Then I referred to one of the
Orders in Council which were passed in Eng]and under their Imperial Act, which I take
to be the form adopted for ail those Orders
in Council. It appears frorn that Order in
Council that the Imperial Act is suspended
so long as the Canadian Act is in force. So
it is quite clear that the matter is flot governed by the Imperial Act, but is governed
by the Canadian Act, that is, by Chapter 155.
whieh commences by saying this, in Part 1,
section 3:
3. In the case of any ýforeign state with which there
te an extradition arrangement, this Part shail apply
during the continuance of such arrangement.

Then, in section 4:
In the case of any foreign State with respect to

Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdomn-

That is, the Act passed in 1870--then, the
provisions of this Act shall not apply, but
the Canadian Act applies.

were working in a most harmonious way with
the British authorities on all these matters.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: May I say this,
which perhaps may be a more direct answer
to my honourable friend who leads on the
other side (Hon. Mr. Robertson)? The Order
in Council referred to in the British Act of
1870 is of general application.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
question.

That was the

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: In this sense that
under the law passed by Parliament in 1870,
Treaties or Conventions might be entered into
with different parts of the world. The publication of which my honourable friend from
Middleton (Hon. W. B. Ross) speaks is the
publication of an Order in Council ratifying
a Convention or Agreenent cof sone kind made
with some other power. That is the Order
in Council which is contemplated by the
Statute of 1870, and that is the Order in
Council which would ratify any particular
Treaty or Convention and which would be
published in the Royal Gazette. So that provision is of general application. A special
disposition having been made for Canada, as
explained by my honourable friend from De
Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Beique), that is an
entirely different thing from the general
operation of the Statute, under which some
special Order in Council would have to be
passed to ratify any special agreement entered
into with another power.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The reason I
asked the question of my honourable friend
from De Salaberry was that I understood him
to say that the Order in Council quoted was
dated 1901, and I thought it probably referred
to some, Convention that had been entered
into just as this one is proposed to be. I
thought that Order in Council referred to the
particular document, and that if such was the
case this document should be handled in a
similar manner. If the application of the
Order in Council was general, then I was quite
content.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: There can be no
question of our having to publish this Convention in the Royal Gazette. There may be
a question of having to publish it in the
Canada Gazette; as to that I am not sure.
But it seems to me that it was never contemplated by the British Act that there should
be any publication in the Royal Gazette of
anything but an Imperial Order.

problems which confront us.
We all, I am sure, sincerely regret Senator
Bennett's sudden departure. To Mrs. Bennett
we extend the assurance of our sorrow and
of ou: deep sympathy.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
gentlemen, in the passing of our friend the late
Senator Bennett we are again reminded, as we
have been so frequently of late, of the uncertainty of life and the certainty of death.
For many years it has not been the case that
so many members of this House have passed
to another life in so short a space of time as

during the past twelve months.
As has been well said, our friend Senator
Bennett was a prominent, vigorous member of

MARCH 17, 1925
this Chamber, and for more than a quarter of
a century-indeed, for 34 years-he has been
a conspicuous figure in the public life of Canada, either in the one House or the other. He
was noted for his sincerity and for the vigor
with which he expressed bis views; and I
think it is true to say that there are few men
in either House of Parliament who took the
same active part in debate as did Senator
Bennett, and who were more frequently correct
in their statements than he. He was careful
in the preparation of the matter that he submitted to the House, he was sure that bis facts
were right from the information that he
gathered, and he always had evidence which,
in bis own opinion at least, supported the
statements that he made.
As the leader of the Government has well
said, in the passing of our friend Senator
Bennett another of the old parliamentarians
has gone. I notice the other day an item which
stated that the late Minister of Militia, Sir
Sam Hughes, the late Clerk of the House, Mr.
Northrup, and our late friend Senator Bennett,
with Mr. Maclean. who is still in the House
of Commons, all entered public life at the same
time, in 1891, and were associated together
as long as they were in the Parliament of
Canada. The item I mention remarked that
they were of a school which appeared to be
passing. If that be true, it is an observation
that ought to be regarded, for I think that
Canada needs vigorous, earnest, honest,
aggressive men in public life to-day as much
as it has needed them at any tiffie since Confederation.
I an sure I can say truthfully that on this
side of the House, where we were intimately
associated with Senator Bennett ever since bis
entry here in 1917, bis passing is a matter of
very sincere and deep regret. Having been
associated socially with him, as well as with
Mrs. Bennett, we extend to her an expression
of our sympathy in her bereavement, and I
am sure that all the members of our families
who are so well acquainted with her would
wish to join us in such expression.

forth in the explanatory note printed on the
Bill itself, which I will read:
In many cases, false, defamatory and libellous statements are made in papers, pamphlets and books circulated and distributed, without anything thereon to
show by whom the paper is printed or who is responsible for its publication. The object of this legislation
is to meet the difficulty which arises in such cases of
proving printing and publication, and to provide the
means of discovering the names and addresses of the
person or persons responsible therefor.
This Bill is based upon and is largely a reproduction
of the British statutes enacted for the same purpose,
which have been in force for many years. By 2 and
3 Victoria (1839), c. 12, s. 2, every paper or book which
is meant to be published or dispersed must have on it
the name and address of the printer. And by 32 and
33 Vict. (1869), c. 24, s. 1, the printer must for six
calendar months carefully preserve at lesat one copy of
eaci paper printed by him, and write thereon the name
and address of the person who employed and paid
himn to print it, and show the same to any justice of
the peace, who, within such six calendar months, shall
require to sec the same.

I think that every honourable gentleman
present will be able to recall instances of
publication of libellous or defamatory matter,
the author of which has not been known, and
bas therefore escaped punishment which was
rightly deserved. The object of this Bill is
to prevent any such publication in future.
That is really all I know of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Does the Criminal
Code indicate the fine?
Hon. Mr. PLANTA: Yes, there is a penalty
clause in the Bill.
I may say,
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable gentlemen, that when I first glanced
at this Bill I was under the impression that
there was already something in the Criminal
Code to the same effect; but my recollection
was based on an Act dealing with the same
point, but covering an electoral period only.
I think there is a prohibition from printing
any tract or document during election time
without the name of the printer or the party
responsible. I do not know how long that
legislation bas been on our Statute Book, but
I do not see why, if it is good for that particular period, it should not be good for all
time.

find that it is the printer-the man who issues
the document from bis printing press.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: If you look at chapter
24, section 1(b) you will see that the printer
has to keep a copy for six months. Now,
things change more rapidly in colonies than
in the old country, from which this Act seems
to have come, and a man may go out of the
printer business in a month. Has ha to keep
an office open for six months in order to keep
copies, as required by the statute? It strikes
me that. that provision might be dispensed
with as being rather onerous. I do not
object to the other provision, which seems
to be reasonable enough. If a man publishes
any statement such as this Bill contemplates,
the one who prints it should put bis name to
it.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Would it not be
well to refer this Bill to a Special Committee?
Before this Session is over there will probably
be several amendments to the Criminal Code;
this Bill might stand over and be considered
with the others.
Hon. Mr. PLANTA: I am quite agreeable
to the suggestion that the Bill be referred to
a Special Committee for consideration.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Of course, this
can only take place after the second reading.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
Hon. Mr. PLANTA: I move that the Bill
be referred to a Special Committee consisting
of the following honourable members: Hon.
Messieurs Dandurand, Pardee, Ross (Middleton). Belcourt, Beaubien, McMcans, Willoughby and the mover.

MOTION FOR RETURN

The Senate resumed from March 12 the
adjourned debate on the motion by the Right
Hon. Sir George E. Foster:
That an humble address be presented to His Excellency tue Governor General; praying that His Excellency will cause to be laid before the Senate a copy
of the Geneva Protocol, of the report thereon submitted by the committees of the fifth Assembly of
the League of Nations, and of the proceedings of the
said Assembly detailing the discussion and action taken
in regard thereto, and copies of all correspondence
between the Government of Canada and the Government of Grat Britain or any mnembers thereof, in
relation thereto.

particularly to the winning of the war,
although the victory was the result of the
combination of practically the whole world.
France bas claimed that she won practically
alone the Battle of the Marne, and that for
a whole year she alone stood between Germany and the rest of the world. England,
with equal truth, said that the war could not
have been won but for her mighty fleet

her coming in at the eleventh hour with a
couple of millions or more of men, and as
m'any billions of dollars, crushed down a tired
foe. All this is truc, but no nation can claim
for itself the glory of having won the war.
But apparently to one nation particularly
will be attributed the killing of the Peace

reports that it was Canada, followed by
Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and
India. that determined the attitude taken
by the British Government on that question.
Mr. Austen Chamberlain himself bas acknowledged it.
Of course, there are other reasons. The
Secretary of Foreign Affairs for England had
to aliege some reasons of bis own, and ha
did; but in my estimation thoise reasons are

not overwhelming in weight. For instance,
one of the reasons ha gives why the British
Government is opposed to the Protocol is
that all the advantages will accrue to the
aggressive nation, having chosen its ground
for assault, if the Council of Nations calls
a halt.
Once a halt is called every nation
bas to remain in the position she occupies. I
do not sec in what better position the attacking nation would be after forty-eight hours,
or four or five days.
Another reason that ha gives seems to me
no more weighty. It is that the British fleet
would be at a disadvantage in having to wait
until the aggressor had been designated. I see
nothing in that. The British fleet could not
be expected to run blindly into war, right
and left, without knowing who the aggressor
was; and nobody in the world is better fitted
to determine who is the aggressor than is
the Council of Nations, which is on the
look-out and which possesses information that
no other body bas got.
Those arguments of Mr. Austen Chamberlain
seem to me to show that the British Cabinet
had no argument of any weight, or else was
concealing the real reason for taking the
position which it did. Ostensibly it is because
Canada and the other colonies pronounced

We know of the

speech of Mr. Chamberlai from the new&papers, and Vhe despatches, especially those in

as taking a stand against which England was
not prepared to go. 0f course, Mr. Chamberlain did noV say that the Baldwin Government was taking that stand because Ramsay
MacDonald took the opposite position. IV
may noV have been so; on that question there
is no public utterance; but there is the public utterance that England bas taken ber
present stand because of the attitude of the
colonies.
I do not believe that Chamberlain, the haro
of Birmingham, and Beaconsfield and Gladstone would feel very proud of their successor
at the Foreign Affairs. lI this instance the

Hon7Mr. POIRIER: I did accept the statement, and I repeat thbe acceptance of it; but
as against that 9tatezuent I say there is the
statement of Austen Chamberlailn.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I make it officially.

137

I may say that

Hon. Mr. POIRIER: Then, Vo put it mildly, someone is ini error. I said Canada; I
should have said the Government of Canada.
Ail this business was done without consulting
Canada or its Parliament now sssembled. I
claimi that this House and the other House
had a right Vo be consulted i this moet
monentous affair.
Honourable gentlemen, you are aware, as I
amn, that one of the Teasons why the Protocol
was oppoeed by both Governinents was the
fear that Canada might flot be consulted, and
moiglit be dragged, as it were, into a war without haviing given assent Vo it. Both Governments claimed the necessity of .consuIting
Parliament before going intio a new war. Now,
what bas this Government done? IV has bound
Canada in such a way that in the future
we may be dragged unwittingly into not one,
but ail wars. I say again that we should have
been co>nsulted-Vhat the Prime Minister is
flot as completely the officiai voice of Canada
as he would have been if both Houses had
been consulted.
The attitude of Canada i ail this business
stSikes me as inogt peculýiar. Canada wus
admitted as one of the fifty-four members o!
the League of Nations, as an indelpendent
sovereign nation, which it is noV. It was admitted through Volerance. England insisted
because Canada insisted, and the other nations
yielded, i order Vo, have universai harmony.
France claimed that ber colonies had as much
right Vo *be represented, in the AsseRnbly of
Nations as had the colonies of Engl'and, but
she yielded for tihe sake of peace. 0f ail the
nations of the world England is the only one
which, besides ber own vote, has the votes of
four colonies, which makes ber four times as
powerful as any other nation in the Assembly
o! Nations.
What was the attitude of Canada when
the Co-venant o! the League -of Nations was
discussed? There is a saying that young men
in an assembly of older men should be seen
and not heard. Just the reverse: Canada
was hardly seen, but was very often heard.
IV was heard when Mr. Fielding, the Minister of Finance, moved, seconded hy Mr.
Lapointe, that Article 10 be referred Vo a
Committee for the purpose -of having it explained. Article 10 is in clear English, and
in lucid French; but that proposition had the
effect of showing that the premier Colony of
Great Britain, and by implication the other
Colonies, and possibly England hersel!, were
unfavourable to Article 10.

138

SENATE

W'hat did the other party do? It went one
better. Judgo Doherty moved simply for the
cancollation of Article 10. The Covenant of
the League of Nations witho.ut Article 10
would be mucli the samo as a man
mimus his heart. Article 10 could stand by
itselýf: the building could be erected around it.
Pluck out from the Covenrant Article 10 and
the whole Covenant faits to naught. That
was a strange attitude for Can-ada to take.
Honourable gentlemen will remark that I arn
making no partisan affair of this. The wbole
of it culminated in the despatch of our
Premier. which h-ad the effect we ail know.
There is a misconceptien about the Covenant of the League of Nations. Somo people
have said-it has heen stated in -this Housethat the apparent purpose of the Protocol
was the stirring up of wars. An eminent
Britis.h statesmian, wbo aipparontlly bias run
amuck, lias so stated in the press cf the
world. Consequently public opinion is misled about this affair. It is m'onstrous, honourable ge ntilemen, to say that li4 nations %who
have shedl their blond in -the war, some of
whomn are left with millions of widows and
more millions of orphans, nnd aIl of whoým
s:îve one liave gone hankrupt. wo-uld unite
o foster future wars. 1 say, bonourable gentlemen. that sueh alleations are not only
inisrhievous, but, crimiinal.
The Leaguie
of Nations
is rot the
TreatY of Versailles.
It i: a thing ahsolutel v (ifferent. It xvas born of the v ietory,
but it hias nothing to ýdo, witlh the Treatyv. It
bais com-e into existence simpdy from the fact
that the whole world had just seen the horýrors
of war, biad realized that war is really bell,
and the nations felt that tbhey were perhaps
in a position to unite for the poace of the
world, as they bcd united for victory. That
is the reason for the formation and existence
of the League of Nations.
That League lias constituted the Assembly
of Nations. We bave a Council of Nations:
1ehv
we have a Council of Ambassadors;
a Secretariat. Ahl work barmoniously together
for the saine purpose, because the'Assembly
and the Councils emanate fromn the samne
nations, who are aIl desirous of maintaining
poace. They alI work harmoniously together
because, althougb grouped differentdy, they are
actually one. It is self-evident that peace
is the objeet of aIl tbese assemblies or councils.
0f what is the Assombly of Nations composed?

POIRIER.

part in the discuKsions. AIL the nations are
represented.
Thon there is the Council of Nations. It
bas nothing in opposition to the other institution.
The Council of Nations, as you are
aware, is composed of four permanent Members. Thore were originally five, but the seat
for tbe United States is vacant. To these four
permanent Membors are added four roprosontatives cf the minor nations. The four
permanent nations are England, France, Italy
and Japan-an imposing crray. I do net know
xccvwbo the other four arcHon. Mr.. DANDURAND:
The number
of electod members of the Council bais been
incrcased to six.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: But I am talking of
the original formation. There were five at
fir..t, but only fotir romained w'hen the United
States withdrew.
The flrst nominated onos
ivere ' I helieve, Beýlgium, Spain, Brazil, and
China. Different nominations hlave since been
made, and, as my bonourable friend says, the
number bis been inereascd.
Thoso eight
nations stand on an oqual footing, s0 equai
that they must ho unminimous in order to carry
anvtbing. Unanimity is found only when justice
is meted out. The smallest of thos nations,
if it Put on its veto, could paralyse the gre itest
nation in the world; but it doos ot do se,
hecause the higgor as well as the smnaller
nations have only one objoot, poaco, and what
they decide upon mus~t ho evidontly right,
true, useful, bumane.
Can anyn,
in the
face of this. say that these powerful organizatiens bave heen made for the purpose cf war?
No. The Peace Coenant was made possible only through the union of the Worlcl
W'ar, wbicb left ton millions nf dead, thirty
millions of wounded, and called te arois
sovonty million mon. Such an attompt at
peace had been made hofore in the Amphictyonic Leagiîe. The Groeks put the idea into
practico as far as Grecian colonies were concernod. The Crusades were the union of the
Christian nations against the infidels. Henry
IV made a similar attnîpt. The H-ague Convention was an attompt at c Loague of Nations, but such an attempt eniild ot ho succcs,ýfil hofore the bite war. That ivas the
oppertunitv. and advantage was taken of it.
The foreost nation that is found butting its
head against the League und, as it wore,
tbrowing a mnkey wrench into the macbinery, is Canada. That is nothing for uis
to ho proud of, henourable gentlemen. I arn
net proud of the delegates we sent overscam,

What is the situation now? Several solutiens are propounded. Everyone desires peace,

but it is apparent, as I have se.id, that some
have impeded the establishment of universal
peace. What igchemes have heen proposed
as equivaient te the League of Nations? In
England the proposals are: an alliance between
England, France and Belgium; e pact between
Engiand, France, Bel'gium, Italy and Germany; and Colonel Amery's isolation seheme.
None of these plans is in my opinion a real
solution. An alliance between Engiand, France
and Beigium would certainly he a very
powerful one. But it would he a reversion te
the old order of things, whicha existed from

carried everything before it, and we sent
soldiers to South Africa before consulting
Parliament, and the Government of Sir
Wilfrid Laurier, which was in the height of its
power et the time, would have been swept
out of existence if it had refused. Canada
wanted to fight because England was fighting.
The same thing would happen to-day,
honourable gentlemen. If England were at
war, and seriously threatened, there would be
no time for Parliament to intervene. Suppose
the Government then in power should stoop
down te consult Parliement, Canada would
not tarry: we would rush to the help of
England. There is no such thing as isolation, either of individuals or of nations.

When the firsat news of that treaty came
to us it was accompanied with the statement
that Russia was binding itself to loan to
Japan 200,0G0 men.
But Japan needs no
200,000 men, no men at al, for Japan is ailpowerful, and China, the only neighbouring
nation, is quite impotent.
Against whom
would those 200,000 men be sent by Japan?
To-day China stands under the influence of
Japan and Russia. and any day that those
two nations will it, China will fall in line
with them.
Two years ago, honourable gentlemen, we
were passing a series of agreements entered
into by the United States and England for
naval disarmament, for abstention fromn the
use of poisonous gas in war, and for the
security and stability of insular possessions in
the Paciflc Ocean. Japan bad fixed a limit
of 10 years as far as island possessions, colonial
possessions, were eoncerned. Why 10 years?
Now let us put these all together. Let me
read fromt a newspaper that just comes from
the Couneil of Nations:
At a private meeting Geneva delegates last night considered startling information to the effect that Asia is
loorning up as a mnarket for rifles, guns and munitions,
whichi are being turned out in such quantities as to
suggest that more than platonic compacts ars needed
to prevent certain nations from going into war.

Tbey have been considering startling information, They must have becn made aware
of news that we know not here.
As I said, I am no prophet or seer, but I
can look at the sky andl see the formation
of an ugly nucleus portending a storm tomorrow. To me that combination is against
America. It cannot, geographicallv or in any
other way, be against any other nation. But
wby against Canada? Many are the reasons,
and you ail know these reasons. You know
that the public conscience of Japan has been
hurt hy certain laws ýconeerning immigration
that have been passed by the United States.
We in ;Canada will not admit Japanese or
Chinamen to come in and settle freely. China
bas memories-that the trade in opium was
once forced upon her, that Pekin, the Holy
City, was once descerated and plundered by
a combination of nations, and that a goodly
number of the belligerents passed through
by our Intercolonial Railway.
That comnbination, whicb cannot ho ignored, is directed
against the Unitcd States and Canada.
It
is noticeable that Japan stood by Canada
in almost ail the objections that Canada
made, but with this difference, that with a
finer hand she made a reservation here and' a
reservation there. Canada also bad reservations, but our chief reservation was in reference
to Article 10. The reservations of Japan were
Hon.

-Mr. POIBIER.

more delicate. Even in the Protocol Japan
stood not absolutely against it, but she continued making reservations, thus rendering the
position of Canada stronger.
Honourable gentlemnen, aiothing prevents the
formation of a stupendous fleet on tbat side
of the Pacifie. By tbe Washington Treaty,
wbieh we ratified here, England limits ber
fleet: she is allowed to have a tonnage of
525,000 tons. The United States is allowed
the ame tonnage. As we are part of the
British nation, our interest stands with the
British, and tbe United States stands witb
Britain; therefore Britain is no longer paramount. But Japan is allowed 325,000 tonnage.
Noýthing is said of China, therefore China can
build any fleet she chooses. Russia is free,
and is a power bordering on the Pacifie Ocean.
What coulld prevent Russia ordering the building of a fleet from Japan. They have as
clever sbipbuilders in Japan as there are in
any part of thbe world. Unit for unit, as
was proved in the naval battie against Russia,
the Japanese are as well equipped as any
nation in the world. Let Russia order the
building of 25 of the most modern boat-Q,
and the two nations allied against America,
Then,
will have neariy 800,000~ tonnage.
what woulýd be the matter witb 'China? China
eau go on and build aIse. Witbin 10 years it
is possible that an array of battie sbips would
be looming on the otiser aide of the Pacifie
directed against the United States and Canada. The United States cannat buibd more
than its quota-balS a million or s0. We al]
kn.ow wbat Canada is doing in the wny of
building sbips.
What will be our position? When Englanil
is at war we are at war, because we are a
colony. But wben we are at war Englanil
is not neeessarily at war. The same moral
obligation binýds England to us that binds us
to England, but England, if there is any great
danger, may simply drop us. And wby not?
We are a free nation-wve pretend at least to
be.
Then, Canada and the United States will
stand against tbe array of those three powerfuI nations whose combined population is
nearly that oS balS of the world; wbose resources are unlimited; who need fear no
attack Srom the West. Then, bonourable
gentlemen, the United States will need ail the
billions of dollars that she bas stored. Mind,
I am not talking against the United States;
iny sentiment is Savourable to the United
States; 1 am a friend oS the United States;
but I Sear tîsat the United States is tbe
primary cause oS the failure of the League of
Nationýs, seconded by Canada.

lionourable gentlemen, if ail this should

4. Has lhe filled the poeition; and, if so, when and

5. What is the salary of such office?

Hon. Mr. D'ANDURAND: Stand.
lion. Mr. TANNER:
I should like to
cail the attention of my honourable friend
to the fact that my questions have been on
the Order Paper now £or over a month. They
are very simple questions and very easily
answeared. I find no fault with my honouraible
friend in this matter, because I know he

would bring down the answers if they were
supplied to him. Perhaps 'he will *be good
cn'ougha to remind the persons responsible for
them that a great deal of time bas passed
since the inquiries were placed on the Order
Piaper.
Hon. MT. DANDURAND:
I may informi
my honourable friend that some two or three
weeks ago, before the last adjournment, I
saw the Minister of Justice, because I thouglit
this matter came under hie supervision. I
asked him why I was not getting an answer,
stating that I wanted to clear the Order
Paper. lie Iooked at the question and said:
"Well, you should have had an anewer by
now." I have not 'been able to see him
since; but this morning I telephoned hie
Deputy and asked why I had flot received
the answer. lie looked at the Order Paper
and sa-id: "lias not the Civil Service Commission answered the question?"
lion. Mr. SCHAFFNER:
Paating the
buck.
lion.. Mr. DANDURAND:
I said: "No,
it has not. Will you kindly take a note of it
and see Vhat the Civil Service Commission
or some other departament answers the question?" lie said he would take up the matter.
lion. Mr. TANNER:
Perhaps we mnay
hope to catch u-p with it by the 2lst of April.
lion. Mr. DAN])URAND:
April.
The inquiry stands.

Subsequent to the periods covered in answers of the
Government, Senate Hansard, June 3rd, 1924, page 354
-to
the present date(a) What is the value and quantity of intoxicating
liquors entered or stored in bonded warehouses in the
City of Halifax, N.S.?
(b) What is the value and quantity of intoxicating
liquors sn such bonded warehouses at the time mentioned and stored therein since which has been exported ?
(c) To what countries were the liquor exported?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would suggest to my honourable friend that this inquiry be dealt with in the same way as the
previous one.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I do not think there
is really any reason for converting this inquiry into an Order for a Return. Last
year I asked similar questions covering the
whole period from 1921 to 1924, and the answer came down within ten days. This inquiry relates to only a few months, and it
has been on the Order Paper for ten days.
I should prefer that it stand as an inquiry,
and I can see no reason why it should not be
answered.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I can only act
according to the documents which I have.
The answer that came from the Department
-it is net from the Minister, because just
now he is away because of sickness-is:
This information has to be obtained fromi the port.
This inquiry should be miade in the form of a return.

I am reading, parrot-like, what is lut into
my hands. I will endeavour to get an answer by the 21st of April, although I suppose
a Return would reach this Chamber as soon
as an answer to the inquiry. However, I am
in the hands of my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I am pointing out
that last year they were able te give all the
details for four years. Now I am asking for
information covering a period of less than

one year.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Very well, we

will leave the inquiry on the Order Parer.
The inquiry stands.

DIVORCE BILL
THIRD

READING

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY moved the third
reading of Bill A, an Act to correct a clerical

errer in Chapter 166 of ithe Statutes of 1924,
intituled:
"An Act for the relief of James
Henry Kirkwood."

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

I suppose the

record will be sufficiently complete to satisfy
the House of Commons, because practically
this has an important bearing on the Statute
itself.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
I can assure
the honourable gentleman that the Clerk of
the Committee has extended the record in
full in such a way that it will be satisfactory
to anybody. He shows that it is clearly a
clerical errer, and details the steps he took te
correct it. As a matter of fact, the man
wanted 'to re-marry, and found that he could
net get a certificate from the Registrar General in Toronto, and the Clerk of the Committee went up there and satisfied the Registrar General as to the facts. That is all
spread u.pon the record.
The motion was agreed te, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.

RETURN OF FEES

Bills relating te religious and charitable institutions.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second

He said:

ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
will be seen that we have
gentlemen, it
exnausted our Order Paper, and that there
is nothing for to-morrow or the following
days on the Paper.
I have had to take notice of the official
information which was given to the House
of Commons, that after the present debate
on ocean freight rates the Budget would be
brought down, with the hope that it would
be disposed of before Easter. As it is quite
evident that no legislation will come here
between now and Easter, I beg leave to move
that when the Senate adjourns this day it
stand adjourned until Tuesday, the 21st of
April, at 8 p.m.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
gentlemen, with reference to the observation
and motion of my honourable friend the leader
of the Government, while we concur, with
some regret, in his motion, I think it is only
proper that we should ask him again to use
his good offices to sec that there is a substantial programme of business ready for the
attention of this House when we meet again.
It occurs to me that if this should not be the
case, the situation will have to be officially
recognized, and the attention of the other
Chamber called to the existing conditions, as
I think it is very undesirable that they should
continue.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, April
21, at 8 p.m.

Hon. Mr. DANDTJRAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, I desire to lay on the Table of
the House the Annual Report of the Canadian
National Rai-lway System for 1924, in English
and in French. I understand that the Report
has been distributed through the Post Office
to the memibers of this Chamber.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Do I understand
my honourable friend the leader of the Government to state that the Canadian National
Annual Report has been distri'buted?
Hon. Mr. DANIDURANII: So I was informed-that -it had been distributed, either
through the Distribution Office or the Commous Post Office, but to the two branches of
Parliament. I have not verified that statement.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have not yet
receivçd a copy, and I have inquired of a
number of members of this bouse and have
been una;ble so far to flnd anyone who has
received a copy. That is the reason why I
inquired yesterday for the Report and asked
that it be brought down. I hope >it will be
distributed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURjAND:
I will see to
it immediately, so that distribution may take
place.
TIIE LEAGUE 0F NATIONS PROTOCOL
MOTION FOR RETURN

On the Order:
Resuming the further adjourned Debate on the motion
by the Right Hon. Sir George Foster, G.C.M.G.: That
an humble address be presented to His Exeellency the
Governor General praying that Hlis Excellency wifl
cause to be laid before the Senate a copy of the
Geneva Protocol, of the report thereon submitted by
the committees of the fifth Assembly of the League
of Nations, and of the proceedings of the said Assembly detailing the discussion and action taken in regard
thereto, and copies of all correspondence between the
Goverment of Canada and the Governinent of Great
Britain or any members thereof, in relation thereto.

Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON:
Honourable
gentlemen, when this motion wus last under
consideration by this honourable House, I
moved the adjournment of the Debate on
behaîf of the mover, the right honourable
genteman from. Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir
George E. Foster), because he was absent
at the time. It is not rny intention to speak
to the motion, because I think the right
honourable gentleman covered very fully the
subject referred to in it; but it may well be
that other niezbers of this House do desire
to participate in the discussion of this subject

before it is finally disposed of. My honourable friend the leader of the Government may
desire to speak at length, seeing that he has
been intimately connected with the matter,
and I would therefore advise him that, if he
desires to proceed with the discussion of it,
I have nothing further to say at this time.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It has been
the practice for the representative of the
Government in this Chamber to close the
debate on a motion such as that which is now
before us. I was inclined to follow that
tradition, but was awaiting pronouncements
from honourable gentlemen who desired to
participate in this Debate. I recognize that
in this instance it might be well that I should
at the first opportunity explain the actions
of the delegates of Canada at 'Geneva and
discuss their work and the decision of the
Government upon it. I am not in a position
to do so just at present. If no one desires
to speak this afternoon or to-morrow on this
matter, I move that it be adjourried till
Wednesday next.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Debate was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at

DISABLEMENT FUND
INCOMPLETE RETURN

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Honourable gentlemen, before the Senate adjourned a few
weeks ago, I moved for a return of all the
documents in connection with the establishment of the Disablement Fund, including the
correspondence, etc. At the same time I put
on the Order Paper a question with reference
to a loan of the sum of $15,000 from that fund
to the Dominion Veterans' Alliance:
Did the Dominion Veterans' Alliance apply for such
a loan.

The answer is:
Application was made by Mr. C. G. MacNeil, an
officer of the Great War Veterans' Association and the
Dominion Veterans' Alliance, as the representative of
all ex-service mens' organizations.

In the file of correspondence brought down,
that particular application, whatever it may
be, is not disclosed. The correspondence
which arises about that time refers to previaus
correspondence. The particular application in
question is very germane to the value of the
whole return, and I would ask the honourable
leader of the Government to supplement the
return by laying on the table of the Iouse.
in addition to this file, the application made
by Mr. MacNeil, in whatever capacity he
made it, for the loan to which I have referred. The file will then be, I think, reasonably complete.
Hon. Mr. DANIDURAND: I will transmit
the remarks of the honourable gentleman to
the Minister of the Department of Soldiers'
Civil Re-establishment.

to it. It does not alter the amount of expenditure, nor the bonding powers.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I inquire
cf my honourable friend whether or not the
Canadian Pacifie Railway, which is the other
railway corporation interested, would under
this legislation be allowed the same latitude
in using a part of its appropriation outside
of the joint work, for its particular share of
work in the Toronto Terminals, just as is now
aeked for the National?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, I do not
believe that this Bill gives any power to -the
Canadian Pacifie Railway.
This proposed
legislation is solely for the Canadian National,
and, if the C.P.R. needs enabling powers
which it bas not already, it will have to corne

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill

RURAL CREDITS
DISCUSSION

AND

INQUIRY

Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY rose in accordance with the following notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate to the
matter of Rural Credits, and will inquire if it is the
intention of the Government to introduce any legislation during the present session in relation thereto?

He said: Honourable gentlemen, it will not
be necessary to make any remarks at all on
this ubject if the honourable leader of the
Covernment is in a position to assure the
House that it is the Government's intention
to introduce legislation on rural credits this
year. In that case, of course, I would not
make any remarks now, but would defer
them until the Bill is brought before the
House.

hoped last year that Dr. Tory would be in
a position to make his final report, and the
Government in a position to bring down a
Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

The subject of rural credits is of very grave
significance, in Western Canada in any event.
Notwithstanding the side of the House on
which I sit, I as a Westerner make this free
confession of faith, that we who live on the
prairies do not benefit, nor profess to benefit,
by a protective tariff to the same extent as
the other portions of Canada. Less than any
other portion of Canada do we benefit by a
protective tariff.
However, as a Canadian
believing in a national policy, not for party
reasons at all, but because it is one that makes
for the uplifting of all Canada, and the ideals
of Canada, and makes it a self-contained
nation, I am willing to waive any of the disadvantages that there are sometimes in a protective tariff, so far as the Prairie Provinces
are concerned, and to abate my views on them
for the purpose of having a general law
applicable to all Canada that will benefit
this country.
Many slurs have been thrown at our Progressive friends because they have, perhaps
rather unduly, found fault with conditions in
the West and with the Government. I think
that many of those conditions have been
beyond the control of the Govcrnment and are3
due to natural and economic causes.
To a
large extent they are due to the period of
deflation after the war, a deflation which unfortunately bit agriculture more severely than
it did any other industry in the country. As
we know, the agriculturist in Canada who is
not living near a large town or in a fairly
thickly populated province must find a market
for bis surplus products abroad, and he finds
that mar'ket at world prices. I do not intend
to argue for a moment on the question of protection and free trade in this respect.
I
mentioned it only for the purpose of prefacing the remark that we in the West,
situated, as we are, a long distance from the
main market for our staple, grain, have need
of certain special legislation in connection
with the problems of the West.
We in
Western Canada want compensation from the
rest of Canada, -from Central Canada in particular for some of the handicaps that are
imposed upon us by our geographical situation.
A man might suggest many things that could
be done-and some of them might seem rank
financial heresy te honourable members of
this House, who are not accustomed to hearing
the views of the West expressed as forcibly as
they are in another Chamber. With regard
to many of the things that are said in another
place. we who have lived in the West a long
time and are familiar with the condittions there
know that tlhere are substantial reasons for
certain forms of legislation. One of the things

loases were to sorme extett due to the deflation
of prices. At tlhe time the lands were acquired
there was a certain inflation of land values
among other things, and undoubtedly in rnany
cases the soldier who bouglit bis land at the
prices then current bas been met by the fact
that his land is very much depreciated in value.
I do flot think there have been very many
basses in the administration of the schemle in
New Zeaiand. I have made inquiries- -the
literature is obtainable by anybody-ard yet I
find that they had to pass a moratorium to
tcmporarily carry them over the money
stringcency. We also have had to pass moratcriurns in Canada. In New Zea.land to-day
11-e Governmnent is buying land. I was in the
City of Auckland, and found that the Government there had bought a very large parcel of
land for the purpose of re-selling to intending
settlers on easy terms of payment and at low
rates of interest.
I said I was not goîng to speak for long,
but there are one or two practical phaZes that
1 would like to refer to, and with which. we
can deal morc. specifically where the Government brings down a Bill dealing with this
pnatter, which I hope will be thia Session.
What scheme are we goinýg to adopt? Personally I do not think the system e.dopted in
the United States is going te be practicable
here. I wish it were, because in ail cases it
puts a buffer between the borrower and the
ultimate lender. Our schernes in Canadawe have one in Saskatchewan at the present
time, and a similar systemn is working in
Manitoba-are operated through an organized
Governrnent board dealing directly with the
farmer. That system undoubtedly is open

153

to the objection, whieh Dr. Tory refers to,
and which is obvious to ail of us, that there
is possibility of political consideration comning
into effect. The density of population in the
central Western States, which are the ones
more largely served by their scheme at the
present time, and the relatively greater
wealth made it possible to organize associations. There is an a.ssociation which seils the
bonds, and tho.se bonds are bought ail over
the United States. 1 do not think that without the guarantee of the Dominion Government, we can set up rnachînery that will make
such bonds marketable at fair rates of interest. I think that in the end-and I arn
only offering it by way of suggestion-I hope
there is some better solution-we will have
to follow to some extent along the lines indicated and apparently approved by Dr. Tory,
narnely, the co-operation of the Dominion
Government and the local Governments. The
Dominion Government would have to furnish
the money, which, to be of any use, would
have to be furnished in very considerable
quýantities. That means that the Dominion
Governmrent would have .to issue bonds or
debentures, and sell securities. The suggestion
is that money might be loaned to the Provinces that saw fit to establish a gyz.cm of
this kind-and I fancy they would be only
the Western provinces-and that the local
Governments should guarantee the monies
SOadvanced,

I have no authority to speak for the Government of any of the western provinces in
this connection, but I think it is quite possible that the Government of Saskatchewan
would be quite ready to accede to a proposition of that kind. At the present time that
Province selîs is own bonds, and raises money
in the open mnarket which. it re-lends to the
farmer. Loans to the extent of $9,000,O00 have
been made. ýOnly five per cent is paid to those
who purchase the bonds, and a large amouni:
of the rnoney cornes from sinking funds in
er;nnection with the municipalities and cities
out there. But that rate of interest does not
attract the ordinary investor, because he isý

to invest in the bonds. If those bonds harl
ilie backing of the Dominion Government,
they could oertainly be disposed of at a better
rate than can the securities of any of the
Western provinces.
I amn going to make another suggestion for
getting cheap money which. will scandalize

154

SENATE

my financial friends in this House. It is that
those bonds should be issued tax-free.
The
bonds used for the long-date credits in the
United States are tax-free; and if it was
found nccessary in that great and rich country
to issue bonds tax-free for the purpose of
getting the money at the lowest possible rate,
I have no apology to offer for urging that we
should adopt exactly the same principle. I
am quite familiar with the objections to taxfree bonds, but notwithstanding those objections, the municipalities in the United
States are issuing them by the millions everv
year, because they sell at a better rate than
a bond which is subject to income or other
taxes. Undoubtedly such bonds l fall freely
into the hands of the richer corporations and
individuals who are able to acquire them, but
I am perfectly ready to justify the action of
this or any other Government that issues taxfree bonds in connection with Western farming.
What rate are we paying for money now?
From the remarks that I have made you have
a right to presuppose that it is comparatively
high. It is too high for the farming industry.
It has been my honour and privilege to look
at this matter from both angles. I happen
to have been on the boards of two companies lending money, one of them yet in
very considerable quantities, and I know that
the companies dealing in Western Canada in
re-ent years iave had their own troubles,
particularly the Winnipeg companies. Some
of them have had to pass over their dividends,
others have had to write off depreciation in
conneation with their loans. But the companies that are loaning money to-day, when
conditions -are more flxed, are little liable to
suffer losses. I know of one big company in
Winnipeg which is now very rich, and whose
reserves have been built up to a very large
extent by loaning money at bigh rates of interest in the past. As I say, the loans were
comparatively small. But at the presen- time
conditions are more stable than they were:
we know now, approximately, in any event,
what portions of Western territory are suitable to agriculture. There was a time when
settlement was spreading rapid-, when homesteading was being done, nd it was samewhat difficult to decide whether certain districts could or could not be cultivated proSitably. It was a question whether those districts were suitable to ran-hng or whether
thev were suitable to the growing of cereals.
But now we have learned our lesson in the
only way that it can he learned, by experinse; we have discovce-d that parts of the
West-particuilarlv in Alberta, and to a lesser
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

dexree in Saskatchewan-that were supposed
to be suitible to the growing of cereals are
not suitable to that industry, and such districts are gradually reverting to the cattleraising industrv. It was in connection with
oans on sucb lands that some of our western
companies. and some of the eastern companies
too, suffered losses.
I remember when the rate of interest on
a first alass farm loan in Manitoba was seven
per cent, and the loan did not exceed fifty
per cent of the value of the farm. and more
usualv was for forty per cent at the outside.
When the farmers were paying seven p--r
cent in Manitoba, we further west paid ciglt
per cent. At tha present time I think the
bulk of rural loans in Manitoba are at eight
per cent, and we are paying at least eight per
cent. and in many instances eight and a half
or nine per cent.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
What is being
paid for loans from the Saskatchewan Government?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Six and a balf
per cent, I think, at the prasent tinie; but
the mioney has run out. The applications for
loans long ago swamped the possibility of
meeting thems.
Agriculture is not a highly gainful punut,
but it is fundamental to this countr-, and
is a great industry, and will be for a long
time our principle industrv. Therefore it is
extremely desirable in the interest-s of the
wiole nation that it should be a profitable
industry. Even with thrift and intelligence
the farmer does not make great gains; even
if h-e is prosperous, ha cannot hope to do
much more than make a good home for timself and his family. It is not possibIe to
make fortunes as we in the cities know thern.
He must economize on all hands and in al]
matters. and one of the most fruitful ways
in which ha can gain is by getting his loans
at a lower rate of inte'est. For what the
farmer of Ontario is nrow paying five and a
hilf or six per cent, in Saskatchan, and
perhaps in Manitoba, we have to pay etght
per cent or maybe a litle more. The traffic
will not st-and the tariiî; it is too igh. The
farrmers in the United States through tcir
system are getting loans now at six per cent
at the very higiest, and some as low ts five
and a lialf par cent. bcae
there i; a reulatien thsat the rate chargeable to thei borrower
-hall not exceed a certain rercentage of fbe
rate et wich the monen
is borrowed--I think
the spreaid is about one and one-sixth per
cent.
We want cheap money. I have harl it
said that ce:tp money onily ruis peopj' into

debt. I do flot think the fariner is .going to
run into debt because long-teTm money is
cheaper. H1e *must give proper security; he
maust pay the interest and must pay the money
baek. If there were ever any temptation to
run into deht. with cheap money it would be
in connection with store buil and f arm inaplements and Vhings of that kind, but I do
n.ot think that in a permanent loan on bis
farm there is any risk of the agriculturist
borrowing, or being -allowed to borrow if he
wanted it, an amount that is toc large.
Se we have special conditions cf cur own in
the West. We are in the centre cf a continent.
Our competiters are more davouraibly situated
geographically. We have to pay much higher
amounts in freight rates, apart from the comparisen of our rates with the level in other
countries, because cf our situation. Our
climate is severe. Living is fairly expensive,
because we have te protect ourselves in the
Northwest against the winter and it is te a
large extent, at the present time, a period of
non-production. But, while it is net a cheap
country te 'ive in, nature there, às really bountifuI in the end. We have wonderful recuperative powers. Granted this year again a fairly
good crop of wheat, with present prices, the
East will be astonished te see the recuperative
powers of the West. As an old Eastener I

CONSTI-

PROPOSED RESOLUTION

Hon. O. TURGEON
following Resolution:

rose to

move

the

That, in the opinion of the Senate, it is inexpedient that any change take place in the Constitution of Canada as established by the British
North America Act and amendments thereto, as set
forth in the Speech of the Throne at the opening of
the present session of Parliament, without unanimous
consent of the Provinces affected by such change to
be expressed by the Legislatures of the respectire
Provinces.

He said: In rising at this moment I feel
that I must crave the indulgence of this
House in making a few remarks on the
historv of our Confederation, in order better
to establish my motion.
The British colonies in North America in
the middle of the nineteeth century were providentially gifted with a plethora of statesmen
who had been brought up and educnted in the
school of justice and freedom. There were
many men of lofty British ideals from whom
representatives could be chosen when the idea
of Confederation of all these provinces had to
be established, by men from the legislatures of
the different provinces.
For the province of Nova Scotia the Legislature selected Hon. Messrs. Charles Tupper,
William A. Henry, Jonathan McCully, Robert B. Dickey and Adams G. Archibald.
For the province of New Brunswick, there
were selected Hon. Messrs. Samuel L. Tilýley,
Will H. Steeves, J. M. Johnson, T. Mitchell,
E. B. ChandIer, Hamilton Gray, Charles
Fisher.
For the provinces of Prince Edward Island
-Hon. J. H. Gray, E. Palmer, W. H. Pope,
A. D. MacDonald, G. Coles, J. H. Haviland,
E. Whelan.
From Newfoundland-Hon. F. B. T. Carter.
Ambro-e Shea.
AIl those men had already been inspired
by the deeds of men who stood high in the
esteem of the British Empire and of the
world. As far back as 1827 men like Uniacke
and Haliburton had already, by their constant
efforts and impressive eloquence, secured from
the home Government a change in the oath
of office of members of the Legislature so as
to permit a Roman Catholic elected in the

the establikhinig of a complete national
highway to the western country for the
dcvelopment of ail the transportation possible

the growth. might be. The representatives
of Canada, in their amýazement at these
great facilities, offered to the delegates of the
Maritime Provinces the markets of the West
through the construction of the Intercolonial
railway.
At iast ail the delegates whom I have named
met in the city of Quehec, at that time the
capital of Canada, and in a spirit of conciliation they put aside ail political or partizan
feeling, having in view solely the happiness
of the generations Vo corne. They sat down
at the conference table with one common soul,
and, as I used Vo say in younger years, with
the beneficent smile of Providence beaiming
upon them. The conference lasted many days,
and every particIe of agreement that could
be reached was made, one with the other, as
part of a sacred treaty which resulted in bringing the provinces of British 'North America
under a Federa;l Parliament.

restricted without the unanimous consent of
the contracting parties, each one of which
enjoys the same rights.
I could quote the different parts of sections
91 and 92 of the British North America Act,
which are plain enough, but I do not believe
it will be necessary for me to read them all.
I want only to draw the attention of this
bonourable body to the fact that every one
of the regulations cited in section 91, as to
the distribution of powers, can only be
amended with the sanction of each province
itself. All the rights mentioned in section 92
are those of each and every province, and
the Federal Government cannot modify or
restrict any one of them. Ail the rights
reserved in section 91 are such as each province consented to be deprived of in the
general interests of the country, providing
that no alteration could be effected without
ils consent. Each province signed the Treaty
and had it ratified by the British Parliament
as its special agent, so that it would not be
altered except at the request of each and
every contracting party.
Now, we must look immedi'ately at the
great principles upon which the Constitution
was established. First of all, it had to have
representation by population. The Province
of Ontario-Upper Canada as it was calledwas pledged to it, and there could be no
confederation of any kind unless that principle was first admitted'. But how could the
small provinces of the East accept representation by population with their limited territory surrounded by the sea, with a population bound to be restricted and subjected to
the ever-increasing population and representation of the West? The Province of Alberta,
for instance, as we have been recently told
in the House of Commons, will in the near
future have as large a representation in that
House as Ontario. It will be the same with
Saskatchewan and Manitoba, and probably
also British Columbia. It is to those regions,
particularly those on the prairies, that immigration will flock, and that part of Canada
will always have a population whose minds
have not yet been thoroughly imbued with
the fragrant aroma of the Canadian spirit.
Therefore we must always consider future
possibilities in this country.
As I have just said, the first measure was
to establish federal authority, or representation by population. That principle was imperative, because the province of Upper
Canada had been pledged to it. But this
would mean absorption or ruin for the smaller
provinces, and at last they accepted it on
condition of the establishment of a second
Hon. Mr. TURGEON.

chamber called the Legislative Council, but
now called the Senate, with power to revise
and amend any measure carried in the House
of Assembly. In order to protect their independence, the smaller provinces were given
a larger permanent representation in the
Senate, without which Confederation would
to-day be dismenbered in twenty-four hours.
Because of this mode of representation being
umposed on every province, the delegates of
the Province of Prince Edward Island and
those of Newfoundland retired, Prince Edward
Island coming in later. I might cite many of
the expressions of the different delegates at
the time, but I do not believe it is. necessary.
However, it is well established and must be
w-ell known to every Canadian in the country,
that without the Senate there would not have
been any Confederation.
The Senate was
g.ven extra power in order not only to protect
minorities in matters of race and religion, but
to protect the smaller provinces against the
larger ones. It was then agreed, owing to the
smali representation of the smaller provinces
in the House of Commons, or the Legislative
Assembly, as it was then known, that the
three Maritime Provinces together should have
a representation of twenty-four members in
the Senate, that there should be an equal
number for the Province of Quebec, and an
equal number for the Province of Ontario.
S:nce the opening up of the new provinces
another group of twenty-four has been added,
in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution.
Now I come to my main purpose in calling
the attention of honourable members of this
body to what I call my admiration of the
Constitution of Canada. I have always bowed
not only to the maiesty but to the sacredness
of the Constitution of Canada. It has been
my pleasure on more than one occasion to
hear my right honourable friend, now the
honourable member from Ottawa (Right HonSir George E. Foster) speak in the lower
House of the sacredness of the Constitution.
It is a Treaty which certainly merits the
admiration of every independent man in every
nation. It has been defined recently by Mr.
Bourassa as the most beautiful and most exemplary Treaty ever signed. I agree with
him in that respect. Of late, however, there
bas been a great deal of talk of changing the
Constitution. It has been with sorrow and
grief that during the last couple of years, I
have remarked the lightness with whieh some
of our Canadian citizens, and even some of
our best newspapers which control public
opinion, have spoken of the Constitution.

APRIL 28, 1925
What I say to-day is only a repetition of
what J have said ever since I entered active
public life. When I left college I turned for
a future to New Brunswick, and I was given
charge immediately of a superior school in
the Parish of Beresford, where I enjoyed the
full privileges of the old School Treaty. Twelve
months afterwards, by a change of the educational law, all those privileges were swept
away. We fought at the time for the maintenance ýof our rights, and we found through
the courts that those privileges were :not
statutory, but were merely regulations of the
school boards. We fought again to see what
rights we might have. We were not convinced at once that any change could be made
except by the unanimous consent of every
Province of Confederation, and we felt that
the Province of New Brunswick would not
consent to a change in status. I was one
of the first, in my region at least, to advise
my compatriots and coreligionists to stop the
fight, and to endeavour again to get concessions from the Government ta make lthe
schools accessible to our Catholic teachers
and children. We have proceeded slowly, but
to-day we have a system of education under
which both elements, French and Catholic,
English and Protestant, live like brothers,
each as happy as the other, and each conferring on the other every privilege the Province
can possibly offer. This is the respect of the
Constitution which I did not want to be
changed if it was at ail possible, knowing that
if changes were effected they would come in
the future, and that if we forced the hands
of our co-religionists in the other Provinces,
it would result in injury to ourselves. I have
suffered for the sake of the Constitution, and
I am only saying to-day what I have said for
the last fifty years.
And now there is talk of a change in the
Constitution. A -conference will take place in
a short time. Honourable gentlemen ihave
no doubt looked over the noble work of Sir
George W. Ross on the Constitution. He says
in one place that it was only in 1907, when
Sir Wilfrid Laurier called a conference of ail
the provinces of the Dominion, that it was
established that the Constitution could only
be changed by such means. I wish to be permitted, honourable gentlemen, to say that I
contributed somewhat to that decision of Sir
Wilfrid Laurier, and perhaps I may be permitted to read the correspondence I exchanged
with him at that time, when I thought that
a proper course was not being followed by the
provinces which were claiming further increases in subsidies. I wrote to him to that

159

effect on the 17th of September 1906-as you
see, it is nearly twenty years since I made to
Sir Wilfrid Laurier the appeal that I -am today making to his successor. These letters
are in French, but I will ask to be permitted
to read then in English, and then I will give
the originals to Hansard for the French edition.
Bathurst, N.B., 17th September, 1900.
Riglit Hon. Sir Wilfrid Laurier,
President of the Council,
Ottawa, Ontario.
My Dear Sir Wilfrid:
Kindly permit me to express my views upon the
question of the increase of subsidies to the provinces
before the conference on this question takes place.
I am not averse to giving certain appropriations
to the governments of the provinces to permit them
to assist more effectively and more patriotically in
popular education and in colonization. But I consider that any change in our Constitution is a great
danger which must be prevented above all things, or
be permitted only by strictly Constitutional means.
When we have broken our Constitution in one
article we shall be asked to break it in another.
I an astonished and chagrined to see the levity
with whioh the Premier and the honourable members Tepresenting the Province of Qudbe are asking
for this change. They ought to know that in our
Maritime Provinces there will be a demand that the
Constitution be amended so as to maintain our representation to the Commons se it was in the first
Parliament. As a consequence our representation to
the Senate later will be decreased.
It would at once take away from the Province of
Quebec the finest part of her autonomy, and consequently aR her special prerogatives. What would
not be asked later?
I am irresistibly opposed to this proposition of
my colleagues from the Maritime Provinces, and
shall resist it to the utmost of my ability in the
interests of the Province of Quebec as welN as in the
interest of the Catholic population, particularly in the
Maritime Provinces.
I regret not being able last session to resume the
debate on the motion of Mr. Hughes, which I had
adjourned.
My desire would rather be that we should give
better terme " by voting them an annuel amount
proportionate to their respective population for the
promotion of education and colonization, and leaving
them free, as they are to-day, to choose their methods
to attain that end.
I desired to inform you of my views, particularly
in order that the Premiers of the Maritime Provinces might not be able to claim the unanimous concurrence of the members from those Provinces in
their contentions, especially with regard to representation.
Kindly accept the assurance of my high esteain.
As ever,
Yours faithfuly,
Onésiphore Turgeon.

Here is the letter I received from the Right
Hon. Sir Wilfrid Laurier in reply:
Ottawa, 19th September, 1900.
My Dear Turgeon:
I have just received your letter of the 17th instant.
Pray accept my thanks. I am happy to ses that you
are deeply interested in the great political questions.

SENATE

simply resolves itself into this-and I believe you share
my views: la it opportune .te change the Constitution on the demand of only a few of the Provinces,
and is it net preferable to affirin the principle that
if the demand is te he granted it must be unanimous on the part of the Provinces? If this point
of view were adopted I believe it would meet absolutely the objections which you have pointed out. I
have carefully studied this question but have net yet
arrived at a definite decision.
I shall be happy if you will again give me your
views on the subject.
Believe me, as ever, my dear Turgeon,
Yours very truly,
Wilfrid Laurier.

I replied:
Bathurst, 24th September,

1900.

Right Hon. Sir Wilfrid Laurier,
President of the Council,
Ottawa.
My Dear Sir Wilfrid:
On my return from Halifax I find your kind letter
of the 19th instant in reply te mine regarding the
question of subsidies and other matters which might
he submitted te a conference of the provincial prime
ministers which will taike place in a very short time.
I appreciate very highly the attention yeu have
given te my remarks. The considerations which I
submitted te you have always been te me a subject
of meditation, and it is on these great political questions that most is expected of me by my compatriots
and co-religionists in New Brunswick. I appreciate
highly the weight which you give te my objections,
and I arm happy te see that you share them with
me. I hasten te answer your kind request te give
you my views upon the proposition which you have
put te me. le it opportune te change the Constitution
at the demnand of a few of the provinces only, and
is it not better te affirm the principle that the
demand if it is te be granted must he unanimous
on the part of the Provinces? In raply I venture
te say that notwithstanding my solicitude this principle would meet the objections I have pointed out
to you, and would secure tihe guarantees given te the

Province of Quebec in its representation in the Commons and te the Catholics of the Dominion by
section 93 on education and the rights and privileges
of minorities, whether Catholic or Protestant, with
regard te religious instruction.
The representation and the rights of minorities
with regard te religious instruction are the two great
national principles which must at all costs be preserved intact and invulnerable.
The Province cf Quebec can alone safeguard those
rights for its compatriots and co-religionists in other
provinces.
The principle of unanimity of the provinces being
admitted, it goes without saying that the Provincq
of Quebec will protect itself in its dearest and most
The other questions alil of a
sacred interests.
pecuniary interest might subject us te losses-comparative sacrifices-which would be more or less
adequately compensated in the course of time and
events.
However, in speaking of the unanimity of the provinces, I mean net only the unanimity of the prime
ministers of the day but the unanimity of the
provincial legislatures.
Even a Prime Minister of Quebec might well through
an inordinate desire for subsidies subrmit himself te a
risk with regard te representation; but it would net
be se with an entire legislative body.
Hon. Mr. TURGEON.

Moreover, the principle of the unanimity of the
provinces has already been considered as sacred.
Hon. Mr. Blake, in 1872, on the question of the
'The Iiperial
schools of New Brunswick said:
Parliament would never amend the British North
America Act in the particular in which the motion
asked without the assent of the province affected."
Now, all provinces are affected by these questions of
subsidy and representation.
Up te the present time only the legislatures of
New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island have
adopted addresses on the subject of representation
as wefl as on subsidies. Quebec has taken action on
the question of subsidies but net on that of representation. The other legislatures have net yet acted. Everything considered, I really believe the principle of
unanimity of the provincial legislatures will meet al]
the objections I pointed out in my letter of the
17th instant.
A further word, if you please. I do net believe
the protestations of a certain part of the press of
Quebec, that the fathers of Confederation have net
foreseen the development of the country, particularly
of the West. Was it net in anticipation of the future
growth of the West the Fathers of Confederation
gave te the smaller provinces of the East a larger
representation, and in the Senate a permanent one,
in order te compensate for the loss of their influence
in the Commons by the increased representation of
the West in that Chamber. The Senate was given
te us te protect the small provinces and the weaker
sections; it is there that they wiii have te look for
protection. Was it net in view of the development
of the West that Sir George Cartier besought FrenchCanadians te take possession of the West? After
Confederation the governîments of Quebec and the
Maritime Provinces allowed their children te go by
thousands te the United States, instead of trying te
keep themn or direct them towards the West.
Pleasse accept these remarks with your usual
benevolence, and believe me, my dear Premier, with
high consideration and best wishes of success.
Your devoted servant,
O. Turgeon.

Now. it is easiiy seen that when a change
in the Constitution was to be made, Sir
Wilfrid Laurier desired a decision of all the
Provinces of the day, and he called a conference of the representatives of the nine
legislatures. Alberta and Saskatchewan, which
only one year before had been made provinces, were represented there, as he mentioned in his address to the Parliament of
Great Britain and to the King in the following session. But, unfortunately, during late
years we have heard very little praise of the
Fathers of Confederation-very little praise
of their action and very little praise of the
Constitution which occupies our attention
After the World War, which has
to-day.
upset every nation of the world, we hear that
the constitution is merely a scrap of paper.
It is antiquated, w'e are told, as though the
life of a nation were counted by years and
fnot by centuries: as though it did not exist
for the future as well as for the present time.
Those noble statesmen whonm I mentioned a
moment ago banded together for the purpose
of laying a foundation that should endure,

APRIL 28, 1925
mot merely for their own generation, but for
the generations to corne; and I say that the
usefuiness of the Senate, after all, has flot yet
been realizeci to the degree intended by the
Fathers of Confederation. lIt was made more
particularly for the time when, as was hopedand the day cannot corne too soon-we shoulci
have here a population of 50 or 75 millions.
I have reaci the remark of my right honourable
frienci from Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George
E. Foster) that in the near future we ehould
have in this country a population of 75,000,000.
It will be then thiat this second Chamber wili
be most requireci, that we shall have greatest
need of the wisdomn off its delibcration, in
order to turn. aside the clamours which are
made hy the people on the spur of the moment
and which may threaten to throw' this country
into turmoil and bring about vissieitudes unbeargible. There is to-day a feeling that our
Constitution is practicaily the worst of any.
Every other constitution has some good in it
but ours.. The Senate of every other nation
has some merit, but the Senate of Canada,
we have been told, is the worst of ail. I do
not speak for mysef-the span of life is soon
over; decades soon pass away-but I see a
great Canada in the future, and, in order to
keep Canada great and happy and prosperous.
we must have a second Chamber that is able
to resist the waves of popular opinion which
might at times cause great disturbance.
But it is said that the Senate is very expensive. Somne of the newspapers of Canada,
somne ini the Province of On.tario which I admire most for their wisdom, their sagacity and
tbeir usuail temperate judgment, are tel-hing
the country that as a matter of drastic econiomy it miglit be a good thing to do away
with the Senate. Let me tell them that the
day the Senate is abolisheci Confederation
will be broken into fragments and each province
will begin again a separate existence. After
ail! the sacrifices that have been made,' and ail
our hopes and aspirations, haippiness ia wàthin
sight for the Canadian people if they wiL1 oniy
have the saine patience as the Fathers of Confederation ýhad in their day. 1 say, I arn surprised sometimes ut the papers wbich make
such a suggestion. 1 was, asto.unded to read
in the Ottawa Citizen of February 7 this
statement:
It is doubiul whother any othoe, line of advene
is feasible; but it is quite poseible that, with the
present tensper of the Canadien people, reistance to
any kind of roform miglit lead to the elimination. o!
the Senate entirely. Alter ail, at this time of drastie
economny, it might be a considerable saving ta, the contry to dispense with the Senate.

If I make particular mention of the Ottawa
Citizen it is just 'because, while I do not always agree with its statements to the people,
S-11
RIISSI

yet it is one of thosle papers that I respect
the most.
*We talk a great deal about economy. We
,wan't to economize by cutting: the Civil Service in two, by a'bolishing the Senate, and so
on. Oheap, governments are flot always the
Pest. It is not a few million dollars more or
Jess of expenditiire in the government of a
,coun!try that wiil bring it prosperi'ty: it is the
,wise exploitation of its resources and economnic possibilitie.3 by thos,- Who are responsible
for its government. Soviet governments are
cheap, but under t1heni the peasant is robbed
of his crop, and ail fie can do is to eat in
silence the crumbs that are left to him. We
4zo flot wish to go in tihat direction at the
present time because, forsooth, it is difficuit
to make 'both ends meet. Other countries
are in a position as difficult as Canada's, or
worse.
SI know that, after all, the Senate ks not
,always perfect. Ilt s mo't peiifected by my
~presence Ihere, 1 know. nhe Hlouse of Conimons is ncdt always perfect eithcir. lIt bas
made inany mistakes, I believe, just as tihe
Penate may 'have done. I have, no doubt,
made inany mistakes in my if e. There is
no perfection in Canada, nor in this world,
and if we are more or less 'hable ta error
ai various kincis we 'are to be forgiven. MeanwLhile we know that on different occasions
the Senate of Canada bas rendered this
country valuabie service. I will mention particularly two, oScaions.
In 1898 the Senate rejected a measure introduced by the Liberai Government, to
,wbichi I belonged anid to which I stili he«Arily
,belong, by obstructing the proposed construc,tion of a railroad to the Yukon. Millions of
dollars would have' beea voted and wouild
,undoullteddly have been loat to tihe coutry;
but a nlining lever prevaileci at the time and
.it haci captivateci the mincis of the people.
lIt was thought necessary %o buiid a railway
.ta bring froni that far-distant portion of the
,country the resouirces which were there, awaitmng merely the construction of a raiiroad.
Again, in 1913, whcn a vote of $35,000,000
hiad been paased by thse Flouse of Conimons
for the construction of a few ships for Great
Britain, it was defeated in this Flouse. The
expenditure of tihat $35,000,000 was of no
benefit to Canada and of no value to Great
IBritain. Thirty-five million dollaris were
saveci at that tîmo . Talk of eeonomy!1 People
who speak of the Senate as -an expensive, body
say that it 'coAs $500,000. Well, here are
savings madle by thse Sonate of many millions
of dollars. The Senate, Iby its rejection of
,those Bills, saved thse cost of its -maintenance
EEITION

SENATE

from the time of its creation to this date and
for years to come.
Then. the reformers of the day declare:
"If you cannot abolish the Senate, you must
reform it." They will not tolerate the Senate
remaining as it is. They will not bave a
permanent Senate or an appointed Senate.
Some want an elective body; others urge that
the Senate should be appointed by the Provinces. Everyone has his own suggestions to
make.
If we sit down and consider seriously the
action of the Fathers of Confederation, we
shall praise their wisdom in deciding to have
the Senate appointed, because it meant greater
safety for the future.
I have said that no change could be made
without the consent of every Province, and
then it would be necesary to do as Sir Wilfrid
Laurier did in 1907-refer the unanimous decision of the !Provinces to the British Parliament for ratification. This is natural in view
of the establishment of the Provinces, for when
the Fathers of Confederation had decided upon
their Act, which was called the British North
America Act, it had to be submitted to the
British Parliament. The Bill was introduced
in the British House of Commons by Mr.
Adderley in these words:
The House may ask what occasion there can he
for our interfering in a question of this description.
It will, however, I think, be manifest, upon reflection, that, as the arrangement is a matter of mutual
concession on the part of the Provinces, there must
be some external authority te give a sanction te
the compact into which they have entered. It is very
truc we have often given to colonies, secondary in importance to these, the task of framing their own
constitution. A general Act was passed two years
ago which gives te all colonies with representative
institutions the power, at any time, of altering their
Constitution within certain limita; but it is clear the
process of federation is impracticable to the constituent Legislatures. If again, federation has in this
case specially been a matter of most delicate treaty
and compact b-etween the Provinces-if it bas been a
matter of inutual concession and compromise--it is
clearly necessary that there should be a third party
ab extra te give sanction te the treaty made between
them. Such seems to me the office we have to perform in regard te this Bill.

These are the words uttered by Mr. Adderin presenting to the House of Commons
in London the British North America Act.
It is necessary, therefore, that any change that
may be made by the unanimous consent of
the Provinces be sanctioned by that special
agent ab extra, the Imperial Parliament.
We hear a great deal in these days about
of the few
separation and the destruction
links that keep us connected with the British
Empire. I for one claim that it would be not
only a great folly, but the greatest danger for
Canada to attempt to do away with the few
material links that unite us to the Empire.

ley

Hon. Mr. TURGEON.

We can adîvance the interests of Canad& with
the other nations of the world 'much better
and wifih greater authority within the Empire
than if we were outside it. It is better for us
to leave the appointment of the Governor
Genemil to the Imperial
authority for bis
presence here serves to give every Canadian
citizen a higher appreciation of the fact that
he belongs to that Empire which bas been the
greatest in the Christian world. By remaining
within the Empire we shall advance our interests more easily and more effectively than
if we stood as a separaite nation alongside that
greait nation to the south, with which we hope
to continue for centuries in that harmony
which has prevailed between us up to the
present day. It will be ail the better preserved
by Canadia as la part of the British Empire.
There are some who would albolish reference
to the Privy Couneil. I am not a lawyer;
therefore I am not directly interested in appeals to the Privy Council; but I say that it
is, after alil, the best tribunal for the settlement of great questions of Canadian authority, and the reference of such matters to the
Privy Council makes for Canadian permanency. J hope thait these few links which unite
the seul of Caniada with that of the British
Empire will be preserved by all, and that there
is not one member of this honourable body
who would vote to destroy them.
Other people want an elective Senate. This
is possible. If in the coniference which the right
honourable the Prime Minister and his Government have called for the near future it is
unanimously agreed that Senators shal 1
be
elected instead of being appointed, it is most
likely that the Parliament of Great Britain
wili sanotion the change. But may I say that
in the consideration of this particular 'point,
whether the Senate should be appointed or
elective, it
was again the Fathers of
Confederation from the Maritime Provinces who ýinsisted most steadily--as I
am sure
my right
honourable
friend
opposite (Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster)
will agree-upon the appointments being made
by the Government of Canada, in order that,
so far as possible, men might be secured whose
probity and independence were well known,
and who in viewing those questions which came
from the Commons would give full consideration to the wishes of the people, so that if in
their wisdom they thought those measures
should net be allowed, they might be disallowed, as was done, to the great benefit of
Canada, on the two great occasions to which I
have referred. It is certainly by keeping the
Senate of Canada independent that we can
oest assure the future happiness of this
country.

APRIL 28, 1925
Members of the flouse of Commons have
constantly cited the example of other Parliaments and other Senates.
I amn interested
more particularly in the Senate of Canada, in
the Constitution of Canada, in the future prosperitv and happiness of this country, and
1 say that the Fathers of Conf ederat ion
framed our Constitution in accordance with
the relations of the different classes of our
population-f or the minority as well as the
majority, not only of that day, but of the
future.
Our position is different from that
which exists in other parts of the world.
Some of our young men, in their exuberance,
with their talents and intelligence, look for
amendiment to everything possible, and they
say: "I want an elective Senate: I arn a
democrat." Bo arn I a democrat, but I want
to have a saf e and temnperate demnocracy,
which will neyer submit itself to anything that
would look like communîsmn. Others, again,
say that Senatýors should be appointed by the
respective provinces, the idea being that the
funiction of the Senator is to protect, the province which he represents. I admit that the
duty of the Sena.te to-day is to protect the
minorities of the provinces, or the policies
which affect those provinces, but Senators are
not here for that purpose alone. Senators
should look after the policies of the country
at large, and- their secondary or more local
fuactions are not so insistent as those of
members of the flouse of Commons.
The Senate of Canada has always had, and
has to-day, at least one-third of its honourable
members who have been members of the
Legislatures of their respective provinces.
There is not one Province to-day that is flot
represented in the Senate by members who
have held seats in the Legislatures of their
provinces, while some of themn have helM
high¶y responsible positions in their provincial Governments. Men of that kind are
required in the ýSenate, more, perhaps, than
those who are comparative strangers to matters of Federal policy or Federal interest, to
which they have not given great attention.
One who has been through the flouse of Commons would no doubt give the same interest
to provincial matters in bis Province as to
Federal matters. Therefore I dlaim that the
best appointments can only be made by the
Federal Government of the day.
Many questions will be asked; but 1 am
pleased that the Prime Minister of the day
and bis Government have decided to cal
a conference to look into this matter. flad
any reform oT, curtailment of the powers of
the Senate been attempted without a conference of the Provinces, I would have been. the

s-1l11

,163

first to act against it. Nq Canadian ever
respected the laVe Sir Wilfrid Laurier as I
did in bis lifetime, nor revered bis memory
as I do. Still I took the liberty, as I have
shown, to express my views and my fears to
him in relation to adopting a policy which
was not according- to my judgment and my
conscience.
Having been able thus to deal with a man
whom I revered so mucb, no doubt I shaîll be
permitted to say that, though I may not
agree altogether with some things that the
present Government may suggcst, yet as long
as matters are left tVo the unanimous voice of
the provinces I am willing to leave the decision
there. Many will no doubt go to that conference on the assomption that they must
reform the Senate if they can; but I hope and
trust that their deliberations wil be as careful
and cautious as were those of the Fathers of
Confederation, and as were those of the nine
provinces in 1906, when they assembled in
Ottawa for the purpose I have mentioned.
A great many questions will corme before the
conf erence.
To-day we hear that there are
ladies of high Valent, who have rendered
services in their respective provinces, who wish
to be part of the Senate. Ail I can say is
that I arn sorry it is not in my power to open
to Vhem the door of our sanctuary. They will
have to appeal to the conference, and get the
sanction of the nine provinces; and if they do
so I dare say the British Parliament will grant
that request, with the others.
With all these problems in sight, with the
difficulties already existing ail over Canada,
I hope that when the Premiers of the different
Provinces assemble to look over ail these problems Vhey will be as careful aig the founders
of Confederation were 57 years ago.
They
must noV go there with the idea, that our
Constitution is antiquated and of no use. 1
believe they will yet see that there is something good in it, and I feel sure that such a
conference xviii receive ail the greater s ppreciaVion and respect of the thoughtful people of
Canada in proportion as by its decisions it
bows more noblv and magnanimoitsly to the
wisdomn of the Fathers of Confederation.
On motion of flon. Mr. Chapais, the Debate
was adj ourned until to-morrow.

DISABLEMENT FUND
YUR.THFER INQUIRY

II1on. Mr. GRIESBACH: Hlonourable gentlemen, some days ago I put on the Order
Paper a question dealin-g with a loan from the
Disablement Fund of $15,000, whicha was
covered by an Order in Council providing that
a loan should be mfadie from that fund to the
Dominion Veterans' Alliance. I then made a
motion for a return of ail documents in connection with the matter. The fle which las
been brought down is minus the original application from Mr. MacNeil, who holds a dual
office in the Dominion Vetexans' Alliance and
the Great War Veterane' Association. The file
as brought down lacks a written apiplication
for a boan to either of these bodies. I drew
th.e attention of the henourable deaderof the
Governiment to that omission, and asked in
the Huse for any written application for a
boan. The reply which 1 now receive is that
the application, was in the forma of conversations, as .they might be called.
Now, what I want is this. I want the Gevernment 'to enswer the question whether Mr.
MacNeil applied for a loan fromn the Disablement Fund in favour of the Dominion
Veterans' Aliiance, or for a loan from the Disablement Fund for the Great War Veterans'
Association. That is what I want the Governmenit to state now, as resuit of the conversatiýonqs, if there were conversations, and in the
absence of a written application for a loan.
THE LEAGUE 0F NATIONS PROTOCOL
MOTION FOR BrEMRN

h

The Senate resumed from Match 17 the adored debate on the motiion by the Right
on ir George E. Foster:

TÉhat an hiumble address be presented to Hie
Buoellency the Goyernot Geoeral, praying thst Hia
Exteeiiency will cause to be laid before the Senate
a oopy of the Geneve Protocoi, of the report thereon
eflbritted by the committees of the fifth .Assembly
of the League of Nationsa, and of the 1>toceedings of
the said Assembly detaiiing the discussaion and action

165

taken Inrieard thereto, and copies of ail correspondence between the Goveroment of Canada and
the Governrmeut of Great tritain or any memnbers
thereof, in relation théciato.

Ilonourable
Hon. R. DANIJURAND:
gentlemen, 1 desire et the outset te clear up
two points which contain a critîcisra, of the
procedure followed by the Govermment in this
matter.
It was stated that the decision of the Council
should have been first submaitted to Parliament.
My answer to this complaint is that the first
step to be taken by the 'Government was to
decide whether or flot àt should recominend
to Perliamenýt adhesion to, the Protocol.
The Goveraiment, having decided in the negative, communicated its decision te the Secretariat of the League of Nations. It was a
pressing matter since the Ceuncil of the League
was meeting on the l4th of March, and it
needed te be dnformed in order te take further
action. No Goverament, se f ar as I am aware,
acted differently. The varieus Parliamnents
remained free-and are still free et this dayte approve or reverse the decisions of their
respective Governments.
The second criticism, which. was formulated
by the honorable gentleman fromn Shediac
(bon. Mr. Poirier), is, perhaps, of greater imaport. It was that the Canadian Government's
action had influenced the decision of Great
Britain. I stated at the time that Canada had
net in the lea.st degree influeuced that decision,
Great
and 1 cen reeffirm. thet stetement.
Britain communicated te Canada its decision
on the 3rd of Merch lest, and on thet datle
Canada had expressed ne opinion whetever te
the; British Government on this matter. The
Governm&nlt had been studying the Protocol
with its technicel and legal advisers and it
sanctioned its despatch te the Secretaria~t of
the League of Nations efter it had received
the British communication. The termis of our
de@petch had been for some time under consideratien, and those whe have reed the British
and the Canadien despetches wiill reedily se
that they were made quite independently of
eaeh other.
The Secretary for Foreign Affairs, the Right
blon. Austen Chamberlain, could well state on
the l4th of March that thc Dominions were
all agreed in rejecting the Protecol, beceuse it
was e feot on the 14th of Match; but, as far
as Canada is concerned, the Foreign Secretary
could not have made thet stetement on the
3rd of March, as at thet date Canada hed expressed no opinion.
Moreover, the Protocol had te be endorsed
by a mejority of the permanent members of
the Council--Great Britain, France, Itely and
Japan. France eccepted it; Greet Britain anci

Jtaly rejected it. This settled the fate of
the Protocol. It needed aLso the endorsaition
of ten of the other members of the League.
Many more than that number signed it. Canada 's sig-nature wau fot needed, as the Great
Powers had disposed of it. Great Britain
acted on the advice of its teclinical officers
and for .politiical reasons, to which I will
revert later on, in its full independence.
I now corne to the merits of the question and
to the Governments decision.
I was a representative of Canada at Geneva
with the Minister of Defence, the Honourablo
Mr. Macdonald. Our situation was somewhat
delicate because, during the four preceding
Assemblies, the constant efforts of the Caoadian delegation had tended to gîve the Canadian Parliament greater discretionary powers
in the application of Article 10, while th-a
seheme of the amendments to the Covenant
seemcd to have for its objeet to stre-ngthen
and increase the obligations of the Members
of the League. In virtue of Article 10, the
Members of the League undertake to respect
and preserve, as against external aggression,
the territorial integ-rity and existing political
independence of ail Members of the League.
What, in short, was attempted by the
fil th Assembly, last Septemb2r?
The Leagwc
of Nations was createcl "to promnote international co-operation and to achieve international peace and secm-ity." What does it
sug gest as a means to that goal? The reduction of armaments. Article 8 of the
Covenant says:
The M\embers of the League recognize tieat the
mnaint nance of peace requires the reduction of national armarnents to the lowest point consistent wvîth
national safety and the enforcement by common
action of international obligations.

This article emphasizes the necessity of
reducing war establishments and of co-operating to enforce international obligations. The
Council was given the duty cf f ormulating
plans for such reductions.
For centuries the worid had lived under
the very contrary principle: "Si vis paoem para
bellum." After its repeated failure, the Allies
at Versailles decided to reverse the old
dictum by proclaiming the neeessity of disarming. For the last five years the Council
and the Assembly have wrestled unsuccessfully
with this problem.
Before the Versailles Treaty was signed, il
wvas recognized that disarmament. couid not be
accomplished if security was not first given.
Hence the drafting of the Tripartite Treaty
between great Britain, France and thr 'United
States which protecited France against an
trnwarranted aggression.
This Treaty failcd

of ratification; security was not given; aniJ
Europe bas remained in a state of nervousneas and turmoil.
The flrst and second Assemblies instructed
a temporary Commission to prepare proposaIs for the reduction of armaments, and the
third Assembly, flnally recognizing that no
headway could be made if security was not
given, passed the famous Resolution 14, which
instructed the Temporary Mixod Commiss:on
to prepare a draft treaty which woultl provide
immediate and effective assistance ýn the
event of a nation being attacked.
The Commission submitted a draft treaty
of mutual assistance to the Fourth Assembly,
in 1923, which was referred to the various
Governments for their observations.
It was
approved by some and rejerted by nrWst
nations. Great Britain and Canada heing
among the latter.
This was the result of five years of arduous
labotur up to the moment when the last Asscmbiy gathered at Geneva. last September.
The uppermost thought of the delegaticris
was still of a way to be found to reduce
armaments and thereby set the minds of
ilie people towards peace.
You can on:y
obtain peace of mind if you remove fear.
In this instance, as in most others t.hrouglout wvorld history, it is the fear of the
vanquisbed by the victors. I heard, while in
Geneva, Count von Bernstorff, the former
German Ambassador to Washington, when
addressing a Peace Society, make this statement: "We hear on ahl sides a clamor for
securîty.
Security against whom?
Against
Germany, the vanquished, and the only nation
which has thoroughly disarmed."
And yet
tbat fear is natural and justifit'd.
Germany
is a powerful country which can rapidly recuperate. It is proliflc, and it bas no colon;a"s
for its surplus population.
Will this proud
nation forever resign itself to the condition
dictated by the Treaty of Versailles?
its
neighbours do not believe it, and so long as
loop-iholes reinain in the Covenant, and the
convincing assurance of assistance is not forthcoming, no disarmament can be expected.
Mr. Ramsay MacDonald brougbt to Geineva
a new formu-Lla-to replace tihe law of anight
by t-hat of justice; compulsory arbitration of
ail differences betweýen nations to be the
ruie, anad the ýone which refuses to, arbitrate

to be the aggressor and an outlaw. For the
flrst time in the history of the worid, such
a bold proposition was foTmulated by the
Prime Minister of a great country and offered
to the officiai delegates of 54 nations. For
centuries, it could verily be said: "Homo
homini lupus." This new doctrine in international affairs is the principle which rules

APRIL 29, 1925
individuels in organized societies outside -of
the jungle. This is a forward step. Compulsory arbitration should be t'he gospel of
demoeracy, for it means equality before the
law-the stro)ng, the mighty, agreeing to be
on an equal footing with the weakest.
Lt is flot to be hoped that this bold departure wiil' be accepted without a struggle.
Lt bas ibeen rny privilege to rend the débate
in the British House of Cominons on this
question. One will find there many interesting adverse arguments, sucli as this, that
arbitration is a very geod solution, but flot
for the settiement of ail questions, and it
should flot be compulgory. If this objection
be valid, it means that the iaw of might is
stiil to prevail, and the stronger and the
bully will flot be thwarted. Then, again, we
are told that this is too boki a step, for
which the worId is not prepared; that progreas
is of slow growth; that it is a splendid ideal,
but umattainalble at present. Mr. Ramsay
MacDonald gave what, seems to me the
proper answer: "Proclaiým the principle, andi
the nations of Europe will get in-to the habit
of thinking of arbitration, and gradually we
shall have Europe with a new habit of mmnd."
I wonder if we should await a.notber cataelysm.
whi-ch may enguif our civilization?
It was indeed a solemon moment when the
two most powerful nations in, Europe agreed
to accept equal treatmen't with small nations
before the Permanent Court of International
Justice and, for non-j usticiable questions, before arbitrators. To the argument that there
was always a danger of a miscarriage of
justice, I answer, after a Britishi Comnmoner:
"Better take the riqk-a thousand tirnes less
disastrous than the most successful possible
war."
At Geneva Mr. Ramsay MacDonxald at first
expressed the opinion that eiconomic sanctions
against an outlaw nation would suffice if
general disarmarnent, or reduction of armamentis was agreed te. It was soon realized
that, in the present state of nervousness in
which European nations find themselves, there
could be no disarinament if eecurity were
not provided Vhrough military sanctions. Thus
the Protocol took shape with that trilogyarbitration, security, and disarinament-as its
underlying, essential basf.. These were not
new principles, for they were to be found in
the Covenant. There were loop-holes ini that
instrument, however. If the Council of the
League was flot unanimous in its findings,
under Article là the Members of the teague
had the right to itake such action se they
shouid consider necessary for the maintenance
of right. and justice. 'This plainly authorizes
war. Under the Protocol, a final and binding

167

decision is always made, if not by 'the unanimity of Council, then by appointed aiibitrators.
The aggres-sor is defined anti denounced. i~f
the Council does flot at once succeed in
determining the aggressor, it enjoins upon the
belligerents an armistice, and whoever vialates it is the aggressor.
The fissures or gaps in the Covenant are
closed, according to 'M. Bénès. The fifth
Assembly had the duty of exploring the ways
leading to a reduotion of armaments, under
mandate of the Covenant, anti in the spirit
of that instrument.
The query very likely runs in the mînds of
my colleagues: "If the. Protocol has some
virtue, why has the Canadian Government
rcjected it?" Speaking for the Canadian delegation at Geneva, I stated that Canada would
doubtless be ready to accept the principle of
compulsory arbitration; as to the question
of sanctions, that Canada would be prepared
to accept sanctions against herself, but I did
flot know in what measure Canada would
pledge herseif to impose them upon others. I
recognized that the Protocol formed a logical
and harmonious whole, corresponding to the
needs of Europe, and designed mainly for
application to, that Continent. Our Government and Parliament would have to consider
in what measure this document would meet
the conditions of our country, and would decide whether it could undertake to subseribe
to its obligations.
In order that our present position be clearly
understood, it is ncessary to recail the stand
taken by Canada during the last five years at
Geneva. What has been our policy since we
signed the Covenant at Versailles in June
1919? As is well known, the Covenant was
the main thought of President Woodrow
Wilson. He is the recognized founder of the
League of Nations. Ail the Allies gave their
adhesion to this great scheme on the 'assurance of the President of the United States
that, if we remained together, we could win
the peace as, together, we had won the war.
The withdra;wal of bis own country bas
demonstrated the truth of his statement:
divided, we have lost the peace. It was easy
to assure peace, and to create a feeling of
security in Europe, with the United States
playing in the League the role of a disinterested umpire. With the co-operation of the
United States, the riake assumed were small.
The aspect of things changeti radically when
Canada found berself alone in North America
to answer the eall for police duty in a rudderless Europe. I wonder if ber Parliament
would have assumed the obligations contained
in the Covenant if it had been told that the
United States were not to join it. Here i.

nited States imposed
The failure of the
upon our delegates at Geneva the obligation
of moving yearly for the withdrawal or modification of Article 10 of the Covenant. The
fourth Assembly, in 1923, seomed disposed to
agree to an interpretative clause being added
to Article 10. Only one vote was registered
against it, that of Persia. It reads as follows:
It is in conforinîty with the spirit of Article 10 that
in the evnat of the Council consider;ng it to be its
duty to recommend the application of nilitary messures in consequence of an aggression or danger of
threat of aggression, the Council shall be bound to
take account, more particularly, of the geographical
situation and of the snecial conditions of each Stat.
It
is for the constitutional authorities of eacu
Member to decide, in reference to the obligation if
preserving the independence
and the integrity of
the territory of Members, in what degree the Member
is bound to assure the execution of this obligation by
employmuent of its military forces.
The recommendation nade by the Council shall he
regarded as beig of the h iglet imîpo, lrance, and
shall be taken into consideration by all the Members
of the League with the desire to execute their

In the drafting of the Protocol it was our
duty to inform the Members of the drafting
Committee that the terms of this interpretative clause should be found in the amendThe Protocol contains

two clauses which may give to our Parliament as wide a discretionary power. I must
admit, however, that this is a debatable question. They are clauses Il and 13:
11. As soon as the Council has called upon the
signatory States to apply sanctions, as provided in
of Article 10 of the present
the last paragraph
Protocol, the obligations of the said States, in regard
to the sanctions of all kinds mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 16 of the Covenant, will
HIon. Mr. DANDURAND.

imimediately become operative in order that such
sanctions may forthwith be employed against the
aggressor.
Those obligations shall be interpreted as obliging
each of the signatory States to co-operate loyally
and effectively in support of the Covenant of the
League of Nations, and in resistance of any act of
agrs
o.in
the ilr ,e which its geographical position and its particular situation as regards armaments
allow.
13. In view of the contingent military, naval and
air sanctions provided for by Article 16 of the
Covenant and by Article 11 of the present Protocol,
the Council shall be entitled to receive undertakings
froni States determining in advance the military, naval
snd air forces which they would be able to bring
into action immediately to ensure the fulfilment of
the obligations in regaid to sanctions which result
from the Covenant and the present Protocol.

Nevertheless, it is argued that the Protocol
reaffirms Article 10, and makes more rigid
some of the provisions for the application of
econoiiciu

and military sanctions in practically

ev ery future war-sanctions which would be
diflicilt of enforcement, more especially for
Canala. if the United States were not a consentirng party It is not. I confess, an easy
matter to visualize the nany problems which
couild arie in such a contingency, and it is but
reasonable to pause and ponder, to survey the
ground, before inoxving forward.
This is the view taken by the Governrnent,
of the
and expressed in the telegranm
9th of Mareh last, addressed to the Secretariat of the League. The Government adheres
to the principle of arbitration, and declares
that it is prepared to consider the acceptance
of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Permanent Court of International Justice. It is
not ready to reconîmend adherence to the
provisions of the Protocol for application of
economic and military sanctions in practically
rvery future war.
Although the Canadian despatch does not
stre-s the-e points, I deem it important to
state what I believe to be uppermost in
the Canadian mind. It is clear that the
objections of many count ries, includine Great
Britain and Canada, 2o byond the Protocol.
AIl those delcguates who have journeyed to
that
have realized
since 1920
Geneva
the work in comnion creates an admirable atmosphere for co-operation towards
world peace, while the result of their efforts is
examinect by the experts at home from an
exelusively national aspect, where self-interest
is bound to assert itself.
The threat of war hovers over Europe.
There is to be found the storm-center.
Canada is of another continent. When the
Tripartite Treaty binding Great Britain and
the United States to join France in repelling
any future German aggression wvas agreed
upon in Paris, Canada refused to sign that

APRIL 29, 1925
Treaty. While Great Britain was directly
interested, Canada was not to the same degree.
The draft Treaty of Mutual Assistance, of
1923, recognized that it was unjust to impose
upon Canada the obligation to participate
in European wars, when it provided for the
sole intervention and co-operatici of nations
belonging to the continent affected. It went
further: it suspended its application to
Canada as long as the United States did not
adhere to the Treaty of Mutual Assistance.
What is the main reason which actuated
the British Government in rejecting the
Protocol and suggesting, instead, regional
agreements? It is found in what it deems to
be the measure of its interest. We have it
from the lips of the Secretary for Foreign
Affairs, the Right Hon. Austen Chamberlain,
who stated on the 24th of March last, from
his seat in the House of Commons, that the
Tripartite Treaty of Guarantee having been
dropped, France was entitled to a guarantee
of security. I now cite his words from page
316:
Her right to expect something from us in th-it
respect is recognized. Our interest and our duty to
provide that security is recognized, and is the common
policy of us all. That is something on which I
agree with the riglt hon. gentlenani.
There is
nothing I more earnestly desire than to find a basis
for a national policy in which we can al agree, and
in which we can all heartily co-cperate.
These
declarations give us a special interest in the western
froniers of Germany. Al history points the saine
way. All great wars, our grestest wars, have been
fought to prevent one great military power dominating Europe, and at the saine time dominating the
coasts of the Channel and the ports of the Low
Countries. Our ancestors fougbt Spain in ber heyday.
Our grandfathers fought Napoleon. We ourselves only
a few years ago fought Germany. The issue is one
which affects our security. It is an issue which we
have never shirked and never can afford to shirk.

And he adds (page 320):
It is equally obvions that, in the view of His
Majesty's Govenirnent, our obligations couId not he
extended in respect of every frontier. Thst is one
reason, the main reason, why we rejected the
Protocol. It was because it was a universal extension of our obligations of the most serions kind.
But we thought that what we could nut do lu
every sphera we might properly undertake, and advise
our people to undertake, in that sphere with which
we were nost closely connected.

The Right Hon. Herbert Fisher, who gave
the sober views of the Liberal party, after
Mr. Lloyd George had in a rash speech-so
qualified by Mr. Chamberlain-established the
truth of Lord Chesterfield's saying that it
takes a very small dose of wisdom to govern
mighty Empires-.Mr. Fisher practically repeated the statement of Mr. Austen Chamberlain. He said that the Protocol embodied
the French view "that the 3ritish Empire
should underwrite the whole peace settlement of Versailles," and he adds (page 395):

Let me tell the House what the French view really
is; there is a good deal of reasor n it. The French
say, in effect: " We have had a great and disastrons
war in which yen, the English nation, have been
quite as fully engaged as we. You heLped, with us,
you are equally
to bring about the victory;
responsible for the pesce settlement. We have got
these republis for Poland, Czecho-Slovakia and the
Kingdom of Yugo-Slavia; but Europe is insecuri.
It may be that iany of those frontiers are badly
drawn; it iay be that the peace contains many
injustices; but, after all, a bad trontier is not su
bad as a war, snd the msinor ,injustices of Europe
are far more tolerable than the renewal of a great
war, and is it not to your interest or the interests
of the people of Great Britain to say tu Europe:
"We will guarantee this settdenent, we will guarantee
every part of Poland, Besaarabia, Yugo-Slavia and
Czecho-Slovakia, and, if you join us in guaranteeing
the new Europe, depend upon it, it will not be
disturbed and Europe wll have a generation of
peace.",
That is the French argument, and I submit that
it is one which deserves tu be treated with respect.
I cannot myself think that the British people wMI
I
ever take the view expressed in this argument.
do nut 'believe that you would ever find the British
people willing to underwrite the settlement in the
East of Europe. They will say: " We are not
responsible for Eastern pdlicy,. and we cannot underwr.te a settlement which may, through faults ut
pohey and error, disturb peace, and, in any case, Our
interests ara too rerotely affected.

Was I not right in affrirming that the objections to the Protocol wenît beyond it and
covered as weill the Covenant? They addressed themselves directly to Article 10, against
which Canada has never ceased protestingArticle 10, which guarantees the territorial integrity and the existing political independence
of all Members of the League. And through
all that interesting debate in the British House
of Commons one can hear as the leit-motiv,
the recurring complaint, that the Covenant is
not what it was when it was signed at Versailles, as the United States was there and is
now absent. So states the official answer Of
Great Britain to the League of Nations.
If the British ýpeople are fearful of Article
10 and openly declare that they wi1l not reaffirm their obligations under it, as far as the
Eastern frontiers of Europe are concernedif Great Britain, which is of Europe, takes that
stand, is it surprising that Canada, which is
of America, should declare its inability to bind
itself to apply economic and military sanctions in practically every future war on the
continent of Europe, so long as its great
neighbour to the south, with folded arms,
looks impassively upon the outside world?
The Protocol is adrittedly a European
document made to cover European conditions.
Treaties of guarantee have been entered into
by France with Belgium, Poland, CzechoSlovakia, Rumania and the Kingdom of YugoSlavia. These treaties are defensive. They
assure security to a certain extent, but not
disarmament.

170O

SENATE

Germany has approached the British
Goveroment with the fo]lowing suggestions,
which are outlined, in general terms, by
Mr. Chamberlain (p. 318): Germany suggests a pact with the Powers inmterested, in the
Rhine, guaranteeiiig the status quo and acoepting for herseif, voluntarily, the western
frontier irnposed upon her by the Treaty of
Versailles. She expresses willingness to make
similar arbitration treaties with other States
which have contiguous frontiers, and she. is
preipared absolutely -to abandon any idea of
recourse to war for the purpose of changing
the Treaty boundaries of Eurape. She is not
prepared to say, in regard to the frontiers in
the East, thait ehe renounces the hope, some
day, to modifv some of -their provisions by
iriendly negotiation, by diplomatie iprocedure,
or, it may hc, by re'course to the good offiýces
of the League of Nations.
This statement of the German ýGovernment
hring-s to the world the flrst hope of the ree.t-tllimhrent of stability and peace i0 Europe. If Gerrnany is real'ly cincere, and if
that offer is generallv approved hy the German
people, it may hc the opening of a niew era.
Hindenburg's election, Sunday last, may be a
distuî-bing factor, xvhich will flot -teod to allay
suspicion or scepticism.
The Canadian Governmcnt bas sfated that
it xvili give its loyal support to the League of
Nations, hampýered though it 'ha by its gengraphic oi-tu-ation. It stands for the principie
of arbitration, and it believes that the close
contact of ail the nations in the world, yearly
ivssembied to co-oYperate in the solution of interna-tional problemns, is essenitial to the maintenance of universal peace.

or unfairly interested. Let a second body less
over burdened, less accessible to those influences, revise and correct the original work.
And when ail this shall have taken ,place, the
enacted law will not be perfect, but at least
it may be as good and beneficent as human
legislators can make it.
Allow me to quote here the opinion of a
great jurist. In his well known "Commentaries on the constitution of the United States"
Story writes the fo'llowing:
As legislation necessarily acts, or may act, upon
the whole community, and involves interests of vast
difficulty and conplexity, and requires nice adjustments and comprehensive enactments, it is of the
greatest consequence to secure an independent reviv
of it by different minds, acting under different and
sonetines opposite opinions and feelings; so that it
may be as perfect as human wisdom can devise. An
appellate jurisdiction, therefore, that sets, and is act'ed
upon alternatelv, in the exercise of an independnt
revising authority, must have the means, and can
scarcely fail to possess the will, to give it full and
tatisfactorv
rviw.
Exveryot
knows, notwithstanding all the giiids interposed to secure due deliberations, hroc iniperfect aIt human legislation is; how
much it eumbraces of doubtful principle, and of still
more doubtful utility; howi various, and yet how defective are its provisions to protect rights and redress
wrongs.
Whatever, therefore, naturally and necessarily awiakens doubt, solicits caution, attracts inquir, or s!tiulateis vigi'ace and industry, is of value
te aid us against pr cipitancv- in framing or alt-ring
laws, as vell as a'ainst vielding to the suggestions
of indolence, the silfishi projects of ambition, or the
cunning devices of corrupt and hollow demagogues.
For this purpose, no better expedient Las, as yet, been
foeund than the creation of an independent brandi of
censors to revise the legislative enactrments of others
and to alter, amend, or reject themî at its pI-asure,
while, in return, ifs own are to pass through a like
ordeal.

Beyond that happy influence of the dual
system, of the double parliamentary test in
cutrrent legislation, it should also be looked
upon as a most useful barrier against those
sudden commotions, those unwise moves, that
abusive exercise of political power and those
unexpected explosions of prejudice which are
wont to happen in every political society.
In connection therewith I would like my
colleagues to ponder over those words of
another great writer on constitutional questions, Chancellor Kent, in his "Commentaries
on American Law":
The division of the legislature into two separate
and indepindent branches is founded on such obvious
principles of good policy, snd is so strongly reconmxended by the unequivocal language of experience,
tiat it bas obtained the general approbation of the
people of this country. One great object of this
separation of the lagislature into two bouses, acting
separately and with co-ordinat powers, is te destroy

I hope, honourable gentlemen, I have made
clear enough the powerful motives which inspired the adoption and preservation of the
dual system in almost every nation under
constitutional rule.
Going a step further, I would now like to
show how those motives were supplemented
and strengthencd in the minds of our statesmen, the fathers of our constitution, when
they instituted this second Ohamber, the
Senate of Canada. They had to take into consideration the special conditions in which
stood the component parts of that Canadian
Confederation which they were striving to
build. This Dominion was to be composed
of provinces drawn together, it is true, Ny
common aspirations and purpose, but sep arated, on the other hand, by differences of
creed, nationality and concerns. The province
of Quebec especially was in a very peculiar
situation. She was a French and catholic
province, whose people, deeply rooted in the
Canadian soil for three centuries, had a history
and traditions of their own, and were jtustly
anxious to safeguard their tongue, their institutions and their laws. They were willing
to join hands with the other provinces of
British North America in the establishment of

a great commonwealth. And it is an admitted
fact that their illustrious leader at that time,
Sir George Etienne Cartier, was perhaps the
most powerful factor in the achievement of
1867. But in the meantime they were legitimately intent on the purpose of preserving
their historical and national rights.
The
Maritime provinces had likewise special interests to look after. And from those particular conditions arose the necessity and
opportuneness of providinig for safeguards in
the new constitution.
It was agrecd that in the chamber which
would be in some degrec a replica of the
British Hotuse of Commons the principle of
representation according to population would
prevail. That qiestion had been a bone of
cotention between Upper and Lower Canada
for a quarter of a century. In 1840, when the
two Canadas had bern united under the same
Legislatuîre, equality of representation for
each province had been enacted, notwithstanding the fact that Lower Canada had a population two hundred thousand greater than that
of Upper Canada. The people of the lower
province had to swallow that unequal equality.
A few years later the figures were reversed,
owing to British immigration, and an agitation

APRIL 29, 1925
began for the purpose of giving to Upper
Canada a representation based on lier superior
population. Lower Canada fought the change,
arguing that the Union Act had settled the
question and had laid down the principle
that each province was to be considered as
a separate unit and should have the same representation.
For years that battle was waged in parliament, in the press and on the hustings. But
w\ith the ever-increasing population of Upper
Canada, it became evident that some satisfactory solution should be found. That solution was the Confederation of the British
provinces. The new constitution was granting to the 'provinces local iegislatures with
exclusive jurisdiction over education, property
rights, civil law, etc. It could then be argued
that representation according to population should be conceded for the Federal
House
of Commons.
But
of
course
this meant that Lower Canida would be
represented by a minority of members in that
body. Nova Scotia and New Brunswick had
the same prospect. And none of them relished
that "capitis diminutio." That was a sore point
in the discussion of the constitutional problem.
At this juncture the institution of a second
chamber came as a happy means of conciliating those divergent views. In the Senate
the principle of representation according to
population would not obtain: Ontario and
Quebec would have equality of representation,
24 members each, and the Maritime provinces
together would have 24. The difficulty was
overcome, the obstacle was removed, the
problem was solved. And it is no bold
assertion to declare that without the creation
of the Senate, without its peculiar constitu.
tion, the Confederation attempt would have
been a miserable failure, and the Dominion
of Canada, at the present moment, would
appear nowhere on the Northern American
Map.
In order to prove that this is not mere
fanciful history, I shall bring in the testimony
of men whose authority can not be disputed.
Here is the declaration made by Sir John
Macdonald in the Confederation debates:
In order to protect local interests and to prevent
sectional jealousies, it was found requisite that the
th.ree great divisions into which British North
America is separated should be represexted in the
Upper House on the principle of equality.
There
are three great sections having diferent interesta m
this proposed Fedemtion. We have Western Canada,
an agricultural country, far away from the ses, and
having
the largest
population with agricultural
interests principally to guard.
We have Lower
Canada with other and separate interests, and
especisjly with institutions and laws, which she
jealously guarls against her absorption by any larger,
more numerous and stronger power. And we have
also the Maritime Provinces, having also each sec-

173

tional interests of their own, having, owing to their
position. classes and interesta which we do not know
in Western Canada. Aocordingly, in the Upper House,
the controlling and regulating, but not initiating branch,
we have the sober second thought in legislation, which
is provided in order that each of these great sections
shall be represnted equally by 24 members.

After the great Conservative leader, let
us hear George Brown, the staunch Liberal,
the founder of the "Grit" party. In his
speech on the Quebec resolution, he said:
Our Lower Canada friends have agreed to give us
representation by population in the Lower House on
the condition that they shall -have equality in the
Upper House, and on no other conditions could we
have advanced a stop, and for my part I am quite
willing that they shall have it. In maintaining the
existing sectional boundaries, and handing over the
control of local matters to local bodies, we recognize
to a certain extent diversity of interests, and it
was quite natural that a protection for these interests
by equality in the Upper House shou|d be demanded
by the les numerous provinces. I think the compromise is a fair one, and am persuaded that it will
work easily and satisfactorily.

I shall now quote the words of another member of the Quebec Conference, Sir Alexander
Campbell, uttered during the same debate,
but in the Upper House, the Legislative
Council of United Canada:
The main reason was to give each of the Prorinces adequate security for the protection of its local
interests, that protection which it was feared would
not be found in a Lower House, where the representation was based upon nurybers only, as would
It was
be the case in the General Assembly.
determined that in one branch there would be a
fixed number of members nominated by the Crown,
to enable it to act as a counterpoise to the branch
in which the principle of representation according to
population would be recognized.

I cannot refrain from adding to those utterances of ,the statesmen who framed the Canadian constitution the declaration made, forty
years later, by the great Liberal leader, Sir
Wilfrid Laurier. Speaking as Prime Minister
of Canada in 1906, he said:
One consideration whkeh to my mind is absoluteb'
conclusive and paramount is that under our system
of Goveament, a second Chamber is an absolutely
needed safoguard for the smaller Provinces against
a possible invasion of their rights by the larger
Provinces.

Bearing all those declarations, all those
facts in mind, one cannot 'but come .to the conclusion that the 'Senate is an inherent part of
the Canadian constitution; that tampering
with it would be te strike a blow at the
federal pact, and that the old provinces, especially Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick
and Prince Edward Island, would be justifiable
in considering such an attempt as a breach of
faith.
In other words, the Federal Pact should be
looked upon as a treaty. To use the expressions of Sir John Macdonald, .the Quebec
Resolutione "were in the nature of a treaty

SENATE
settled between the different colonies, and
which had been agreed to by a system of
mutual compromise." During the Confederation debates, Thomas D'Arcy McGee emphasized that point, when he said:
It is beyond your power or our power to alter it.
To alter a Treaty is, of course, to destroy it.

But it is not enough to demonstrate that
the dual parliamentary system is universal,
that it is based on reason and experienoe, and
moreover thast the institution of the Canadian
Senate in 1867 was prompted by motives peculiarly conclusive and urgent. It further 'behooves us to prove its usefulness and to repel
the aspersions made against it.
As I have tried to set it forth in the first
,part of my remarks, the existence of a second
chamber is in itself a guarantee of better
legislation. The Senate of Canada has not
failed in that respect. In the debate on the
Address our colleague the honourable Senator
for Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) has
quoted figures from a book written by a man
once prominent in this House, Sir George
Ross. Allow me to use some of those. Statistics, carefully prepared, enabled Sir George
to assert that from 1867 to 1913, out of 5,871
Bille sent to the Senate by the House of Commons this Chamber had amended 1,246, or
21.5 per cent. Those amendments were accepted, and undoubtedly 'constituted an improvement in the legisiation originally introduced.
From 1913 to 1925, I have not before me the
official figures, but I dare say they would
enable us to come to the same conclusion.
I would like to quote here from a speech
made many years ago by a former member of
this House, during a debate on the reform of
the Senate. The Honourable Mr. McMullen
said at that time:
I went carefully over the business of the Senate
last session and found that, notwithstanding the number of members in the Commons and the large committees appointed there for the purpose of sifting
the clauses of Bills introduced in that body, it was
necessary to amend these Bills when they came to
us last session.
We made no less than two hundred
and three amendments to Bills sent tO us, and fortyseven of those amendm nts were made tO government
Bills.
Su that after all this House has been doing
work, but the press and the Commons do not seem
to realize it. The Bills are amended here and go back
to the Bouse of Commons; the amendments are read
and concurred in and that is all the notice that is
ever taken of the work done in this Chamber.

Among numberless cases illustrative of the
usefulness of the revising and amending
activities of this Chamber, will you allow me
to recail one which made quite a mild
sensation at the time. A Bill came to tha
Senate, whose object was to provide for
improvements of some kind at Fort Frances.
The Bill had gone through all it.s regular
Hon.

'Mr. CHAPAIS.

phases in the House of Commons.
It was
referred to the proper committee of the
Senate. A contract had been passed between
the developing Company and the town of
Fort Frances.
Before proceeding with the
Bill the Committee asked for the contract.
After a while the document was brought in,
and then it was found that if the Bill had
passed without amendment it would have
deprived the town of every advantage secured
to them under the contract.
The Bill had
to be completely recast, only the preamble of
the original draft being left. If the Senate
had not been here the people of Fort Frances
would have feit horrified in finding cut that
their Bill deprived them of all the advantages
and rights that it was especially the purpose of
the contract and of the Bill to secure for
them.
I have singled out that case because it
strongly exemplifies the necessity of a revising
body in the elaboration of laws.
There are occasions when none are more
convinced of that necessity than our colegislators, the members of the House of
Commons. Sir Richard Cartwright, after an
experience of thirty-seven years in the popular
House, stated once that "such things have
been known as the House of Commons passing a Bill in the devout and fervent hope that
the Senate would kill it."
The legislative usefulness of the Senate,
elearly demonestrated by facts, has caused many
public men to change their minds on that
subject. Sir George Ross, once Prime Minister of Ontario, and surely one of the most
brilliant leaders of the Liberal party in times
gone by, has made this candid declaration
in his book, "Getting into Parliament and
After":
I brought to the Senate a few prejudices. Does the
Senate really perform any useful public service, or
is it a mere recording office for the other Chamber?
On this point my prejudices were quickly settled.
I
found, both by its committees as well as by its
frank and practical debates, that many amiencdmnts
were made to Bills sent up from the Communs by
which their usefulness was enhanced, and sometimes
The promoter of a Bill in the
public injury avoided.
House of Commons bas often a purpose to serve of a
local or political character, and this local view of a
measure often obscures its ultimate consequences.
The
Senate, I found, is less influenced, if influenced at all, by
local considerations, and so becomes the guardian of
all the interests concerned. In acting in this capacity
it sometimes incurs the odium of the specialists. But
the whole is greater than a part, and the broader the
basis of legisiation the more valuable to the country.

In the same book. Sir George Ross owns
that he was under another false impression
when he first came to sit in this House. He
says:
Another prejudice was that the Senate treated publie quet ions in a perfunctory way, and took no pains
to inform itself fully as to their merits. A few weeks'

APRIL 29, 1925
experience of its committees dispelled that prejudice
aloo. Ini a long experience on committees on almost
every conceivable publio question, I neyer found anywhere a greater desire te consider every aspect of any
proposition under consideration. No matter how influential its advocates, the other aide was heard patiently, and final action taken only after the fullest
deliberation. Its conclusions miight be wrong, but its
intentions seldom, or neyer.

The bills which I have just mentioned were
governmoent bills bearing on public policy.
But there were a great number of other Bills,
some of a very important nature, that were
rejected by the Senate. From the statistics
already quoted I find that since 1867 down
to 1924, 153 Bills had altogether been rejected.
As a rule those unlucky pieces of legislation
descrvdci their fate, being inspired by erroneous
principles, or aiming at undesirable ends. So
a can be safely avsserted that, n that respect
alu, the Scnate h:tas done cood work. On
the whole, to use the words of Sir George
Ross:

more than once that the opinion of the flouse of

behalf, par excellence, it clained to speak.

I dare sav that the usefulness of the Senate
in amending and improving egislation, and
also in delaying and preventing the adoption
of obnoxious measures, bas been sufficiently
demornstrated. Let us now turn to the aspersions made against this House. The most
grievous one is that the Senare is a partisan
body; and I firmly believe that it is also the
nmost unfounded one. Of course it is perfectly
sture that this Senate is net composed of men
fallen from some remote planet, and foreign
to our political divergencies. Thcre are in
this Chamber Liberals. Conservatives and
Progressives. But that the partisan spirit be
the ruling spirit, I deny most decidedly. I
am net one of the oldest members of the
Senate, by the date of my commission-this
is my sixth Session-but during those years
I have observed, I have listened, J have taken
notice of words and happenings, and I say
witlh absolute conviction that the ruling spirit
of this House is a spirit of moderation, of fair
play, of due independence, of political selfrestraint. Some times, not often, sharp words
may be uttered. Sometimes, not often, political bias may put in an appearance; but at
the bottom of all discussions and debates lies
a latent determination net to go beyond
such a limit, not to abuse the constitutional
power wbich resides in this Chamber, giving
way even when acquiescence is lacking, and
abstaining fron pushing the course of objection to the point of rejection.
In 1874, after the fall of the cabinet presided over by Sir John Macdonald, and the
accession to power of the Mackenzie Govcrament, S:r Alexander Campbell, the Conservative leader in this House, made the
following declarations:
Hon.

Mr. CHAPAIS.

The party to which I belong bas sustained a
complete overthrow, and that will be one of the
renarkable features in the history of the country.
I do not allude to the subject but for the purpose
of drawing attention to what would be the duty
of lioncrable gentlemen in the Senate Chamber. The
Vry reniarkaible expression of publice opinion at the
late elections puts all cavil on one side, and I think
the tusefulniess of the Senate will be to bring about
the wisles of the people as brought forward by the
other House. * * * For mi own part, and I might say
for other gentlemîen who belong to my party, we
will be anxious to receive with every consideration of
fairness all

mnight
bring forward. This government wili not mieet with
any factious opposition, or arising out of a spirit of
,warfare. We will be glad to assist the governnent in
perfecting those mîeasures that night be subnitted te
the consideration of the Senate.

As a rule, the wise principles enunciated
on that occasion have been followed in this
House by Liberal as well as by Conservative
majorities
I appeal to our constitutional
history to sustain that assertion. In 1874, the
Liberal Government of Mr. Mackenzie saw
almost all his main measures get through in a
Conservative Senate.
In 1896 the Liberal Government of Sir
Wilifrid Laurier saw almost alil his main measures get through in a Conservative Senate.
In 1911, the Conservative Government of Sir
Robert Borden saw almost all his main measures get through in a Liberal Senate; and
since 1922 the Liberai Government of Mr. Mackenzie King lias seen almost alil his main
mesures get through in
a
Conservative
Senate.
I know that ýthere have been exceptions,
but they are few. and not without justification. During the last two years the prime
minister could point out to the Railway Bills
and te the Pensions Bill. Let us examine
these two cases.
In 1923, 48 hours before the end of the
Session, a Bill entitled "an Act respecting the
Construction of Canadian National Railwav Lines" was introduced in this House.
It provided for the construction of 29 railway
branches at an estimated cost of $28,000,000,
a figure manifestly too low, and which should
have been doubled, at least. The country at
that moment had to face a yearly railway deficit of $60,000,000. And two days before prorogation, the Senate was asked te pass, quickly
and biindly, a Bill providing for the
construction of 29 new lines. and involving an additional expense of almost S50,000,000. The Bill was of such a nature, and was
presented under such extraordinary conditions,
that the honourable member for De Salaberry
(bon. Senator Béique) made the following
statement:
It is net on the eve of prorogation that a Bill
of this kind should be sent to this House. * * * The

And following the honourable member for
de Salaberry, the senior member for Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Belcourt) rose and said:

The report was adopted, and the Bihl was
read a third time, and sent to the bluse of
Commons. The House of Commons would
not agree with the Senate's amendrnents.
The Upper House was informed of the Lower
House's dissent at 11 o'chock on the 19th of
July, four haurs before the time appointed
by the government for prorogation.
Under
such eircumstances the Senate wouhd flot
stultify itself and maintained its stand, knowing welh that the question could came up again
next session, when ample time could be given
for discussion and study. In this case again
At can be asserted that the attitude of the

I want to jolin with my honourable friend in his
appeal for the witbdrawal of the Bill.

Moreover, in the course of the debate, the
leader of this House hîmself, representing the
Government in the Sexiste, said: "I realize
that this Bill cornes to us very late ini t1he
session." The motion that the Bill be read
oniy in six months was carried by -a vote of
47 against 10. Here was one of the crimes
cornmitted by this body. The Senate's action
was approved 'by every enlightened citizen of
this eountry. At the session of 1924, 26
Bis for the construction of so many
branch lines-a Bill for each line, and flot a
blanket Bill for the whole batch--were introduced, this time two mýonths before the end
of the Session. They were sent to the Committee on Railways, and studied there thoroughly, each one on its own menit. And finally
18 of themn were adopted and put through by
this Huse. No just man can dispute that
the Senate acted fainly on that occasion.
As ta the Pension Act, here are the facts,
A committee of the Houe osf Commons had
sat during the greater part cf hast Session to
study the Bill, and hear ail representations.
But in the 'Senate this Pension Act çwas introduced only 24 hours bef are the day on
which prorogation was supposed to take place.
Lt was a very important Bill, involving great
charges upon the Dominion and dealing with
complex cases. In moving the second reading on the 18th of July 1924, the leader
of the Sexiste clearly indicated that he was
in a dubious state of mmnd. Re said: "I
await with some trepidation the opinion of
the Senate as to how we shahl deal with the
Bill." What did happen then?
Notwithstanding the lateness of the moment,
the imminence of prorogation, and the hack
of time, the two leaders agreed on
the selection of a committee, to whom the Bull
was referred.
The committee sat, studied
each clause, made the amendments which were3
deemed advisabh e, and reiported the Bill. In
the course of the f ollowing- debate, the
leader of the Senate made this decharation:
I did not intend to press this Bil1 on the
attention of the Senate at this late bons, if the
Senate tbought that it shou.ld be deferred....
I agreed ta thse suggestion that it should go ta
a comnittee in order that we nsight examine it and
see what clauss were imperative for tise proper
workmg of tise Act. We went into committee and

Senate was unassailable.

H'onourable gentlemen, let ýthe records of
this House be scrutinized, since 1867, and it
will lie found that the Upper Chamber 'bas
hoyally acted the part.which had been ahlotted
to it by the fathers of our Constitution. Lt
bas improved dËfective Buis. It bas stopped
haxmiful legishation. It bas dehayed doubtful
measures. On the wlhole it has exercised
fairly its improving and staying powers. No
sensible man wouhd assert, t-hat it bas neyer
failed, that it lias neyer been wrong, that it,
bas neyer convmitted mistakes. But none o
its detractors couhd point ta any case where
it bas deliberately opposed policies whose
object was to promote the best interests of
the country. How and when lias the Senate
of Canada stood. in the way of wise Teform?
How and when lias the Senate of Canada
vetoed measures intended ta raise the nation's
standards? How and when býas the Senate of
Canada refused to co-operate in soundly progressive hegilation? How and when has the
Senate of Canada presumed ta make its 'will
prevail over the clearhy expressed will of
the people? Nothing of the kind can lie
detected in the pages of its annaIs.
At laet, let us corne ta the crucial point:
the mode of recruiting the me'mbership of
the Sexiste. On that, poinet .perhaps less liban
on any other can unanimity be expected.
DuTing the hast twenty years four or five
earnest debates have taken place in, this
bouse on that subject. And always the most
divergent views have been expressed.
This body is a nominated body. Would it
'lie a botter one if it were electeâ? And if so,
what would, be the best mode of election?
Would that ipower be entrusted ta the provinciail legisiatures? Wouhd; it, le more advisabl-e

the old Legislative Council of Canada, in preConfederation times? Would' it not rather be
desirable to combine the two modes, the
nominative and the elective, part of the Senate
being nominated and the other part elected?
Then should an age Jimit be provided for, or
should a term of office be fixed instead of
a life tenure? All those questions, and a few
others have been debated in this Chamber
from time to time. I have made it a point
to rea.d these debates, and I must say, I have
been struck with the strength of the arguments put forth against each of these different
possible changes in the constitution of the
Senate. Powerful objections were brought
against the election of Senators by the Legislatures, or by large aggregations of ridings;
against a combination of the two systems;
against the fixing of an age limit and of a
term of office. In face of all those divergent
opinions, one cannot but agree d-ecidedly with
the statement of a great constitutional writer,
Hearn, when he says:
There is, perhaps, no more difficult question in
practical politics or one towards the solution of
which the political thinker can give less help, than
that of forming in a new country an Upper House.

That was undoubtedly such a difficulty
that induced, in the course of one of these
debates, many years ago, a member of this
Senate, happily still sitting in our midst, to
move the following ainendment:
From the very serious objections whioh have been
raised to the several modes of reforma which hav'e
been submitted by individual members of this House,
and the great diversity of opposition expressed
thereon, the present constitution of the Senate seems
to be, on the whole, the best that can be devised
for this country; that however, in order that this
honourable House may give the full share of its
usefulness it is very desirable that means be adopted
to keep it more constantly occupied, thereby relieving the House of Commons of part of its work and
shortening the Session of Parliament.

I would not 'like to commit myseif abso-

lutely on the merit of such a resolution.
But I feel inclined to admit that the composition of the Upper Chamber, under the
present régime, since 1867, has gone a long
way towards sustaining the soundness of that
proposition. What has been one of the main
objects, if not the main object, of al] the
proposed schemes for the reform of the
Senate? Was it not to make this House
more representative, in the widest sense of
the word, more representative of the intellectual, professional, commercial, industrial activities of the nation, more representative of the different classes of our Canadian
people?
I think this cannot be disputed.
Now, let us peruse the membership rolIl of
the Senate during the fifty-eight years of
its existence. What shall we find? When it
Hon. Mr. CHAPAIS.

was first launched on its constitutional career,
almost every one of its members had sat in
the legislatures of the different provinces.
Twenty of them had been ministers in the
iocal governments. Thirteen were presidents
or directors of banks. Twenty were lawyers.
Six were connected with Canadian universities. Three were journalists. Three were
agriculturists. Twelve were heads or members
of -big companies. Four were directors of railways. Eleven were merchants or members of
trade firms. Two were notaries and one was
a surgeon. Surely that body could be considered as representative enough.
But, perhaps, since its inception, this House
may have somewhat lost that character. Let
us enquire about that. After a lapse of fortysix years, here is a summary of the Senate's
membership. I take it from the book already
quoted, published in 1913, "Getting into
Parliament and After":
Who

are those

occupying

these crimson

chairs?

asked Sir George Ross.
One bas been Premier of Canada, seven have been
members of His Majesty's Privy Council, thirtyseven have been members of the House of Commons,
two have been Premiers of Provincial Govemments,
seventeen have been members of a Provincial Legislature, and one a Judge of the Superior Court. The
others have been a dynarnic force in the commerce
and the industries of the land, or professional men of
good repute. In the face of such men, let purple
blood ho poured into the ses. The Senate cf Canada
requires no other pedigree.

If Sir George Ross was still living to-day,
he could add a similar page to his book.
Looking around, ho would see in this House
eight ex-ministers of the Crown or members
of His Majesty's Privy Council, thirty-nine
ex-members of the House of Commons, one
ex-Prime Minister of a province, seven
ex-members of provincial governments, twentyof provincial legislafour ex-members
turcs, one ex-speaker of the House of Conmons, four ex-speakers of provincial assemMoreover ho could verify that the
blies.
Senate is still kept in touch with all the

classes of our people. He would find on these
seats ten merchants or members of trade
firms, eight newspaper men, four manufacturers, twenty lawyers, eleven presidents or
directors of banks, thirty-five members of industrial companies, five professors or governors of Canadian universities, eleven farmers
or agriculturists, three members of the Royal
Society of Canada, one Major General, one
Brigadier Ceneral, ten Colonels or Lieutenant
Colonels of our Canadian Militia, five doctors, two notaries, one civil engineer.
Now, is it not a fact that the representation of our social elements could hardly be
more comprehensive and more adequate?

APRIL 29, 1925
We read very often in speeches or articles
&bout the reforrn of the Senate, that it would
be desira.ble to see the universities represented, the boards of trade represented, the
professions represented ini the Senate, and so
on. Well, ail these suggestions should flot be
put forward as desiderata: they are aceomplished facts.
The universities are represented, trade is represented, ind-ustry is represented, the press is represented, literature
and science are represented, agriculture is
represented, labour is represented; in a word,
ail the Canadian activities are represented
in the Senate. And ail this wouid seem to
show that the position taken in this House
seventeen years ago by the honourabie member for De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique)
was not altogether unjustifiable.
Frum the representatiun of the varjous
Canadian interests, if we pass to the personal worth of the public men who have
adorned this Huse, we can, stili be entitled
to feel some pride. The names of Sir Alexander Campbell, of Ferguson Blair, of Joseph
Cauchon, of P. J. 0. Chauveau, of George
Brown, of C. B. de Boucherville, of Louis
Rodrigue Masson, of Sir Alexandre Lacoste,
of Sir John Abbott, of Sir George Drummond,
of Sir Mackenzie Bowell, of Sir Auguste Real
Angers, of Sir Wiliam Hingston, of Sir Oliver
Mowat, of Sir Richard Cartwright, of Sir
George Ross--to speak only of the dead-are
ail historical names, and shine amongst the
most famous in the land. And the legisiative
body which has seen them sitting ini ite hall
cannot be said to have been shorn of talent.
of experience, of knowiedge, of eloquence and
patriotism.
Honourable gentlemen, I muet apologize
for having detained so long your attention.
A plea "pro domo" is always an ungrateful and
often an unwelcome task. However, I think
that our coileague, the honourable member
from Bathurst (Hon. Mr. Turgeon) is to he
congratulated for having introduced his resolution. We may hope that this debate will
enlighten public opinion, especially that
element which is not very favourable to the
Upper Chamber. There is surely in the minda
of a certain category of Canadian citizens, an
impression that this bouse is flot a friend of
democracy. Democracy I A great word and
a powerful thing I Autocracy has falien to
pieces. Aristocracy, as a political power, ia a
vanishing shadow.
This is the age of
democracy.
Democracy is the new goddess
of the world.
Her aitars are surrounded
by
a
swarming
crowd
of
fervent
devotees. And her statues are clouded with
the fragrant smoke of inoense. I have no inclination to shatter the pillais of the temple.
But I would like to remind those who
S-_12i

wish to understand thoroughly "what is in
a name," and who are always anxious to reach
at the thing behind, the name, that there may
be, that there are, two kinds of democracies:
there às a false democracy, and there is a
true democracy. The false dernocracy is the
democracy whose am*btion is to substitute
the tyranny of the mob for the tyranny of
the despot; which strives Vo make the rule
of numbers stifle the rule of betters; which
bates pre-eminence and extole mediocrrity;
which aims at puliing down that which is
exalted instead of raising up that which is
low. Under the impulse of these feel ings, that.
false democracy has a fatal inclination Vowards socialism, which by a natural trend leads
to com'munism. And thus from stage Vo stage,
a nation which fOllows to the bitter end the
dictates of that f aise democracy, becones,
a prey to that indescribable regirne, Sovietism,
which, after having destroyed the main
institutions, the wealth and, productive
power of Russia, has established over a heap,
of puins an autocracy worse than the autocracy of the Tsars. It was unhappily that
kind of demnocracy which was acclaimed with
such an astounding enthusiasm by aill the
rulers of the Allied nations during the great
war. They were soon to get a splendid reward
f or their blind acquiescence.
Fortunateiy there
is, on the
other
hand, a true democracy, which knows that
levelling is noV erecting; whose legitimate
wish is to open the gaVes Of social categories,
and to make easier and safer the intercourse
between the classes and the masses; which
rightfully elaims the equaiity of ail citizens
before the law, and the -free acicess of ail,
through work, courage, and noble effort, to the
highest gifts of public.life; which deprecates
internecine strif e, but preaches fraternal
emulation and mutual help. I pray to God
that this kind of democracy, this wise and
christian democraicy, be the democracy bonoured and praictised by our people for ail time
Vo corne. And may I be allowed to say that
such democracy baa n-othing Vo fear from the
Senate of Canada. While the false and hatefui dernocracy whose characteristica 1 have
tried to delineate rnay rest assured Va find
always in this House an unbreakable wall, the
true and enlightened democracy which we ahl
respect should ever corne confidently to the
Canadian Senate, where it shali always be met
with a listening ear, a helping hand, and a
friendly heart.
On motion of Hon. W. B. Ross, the debate
was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at

Honourable gentlemen, the

in order to explain m-y motive.
I need not repeat whsit everybody thinlcs
and says, that the financial condition of the

welfare of the country, and that something

the burden of taxation, already too heavy,
too encrons, and so detrimental to our
commercial and industrial world.
It
is
evident that we cannot reduce our taxation,
as is done in almost ail other countries, as
long as we are obliged to pay the doficits
of that railway and the enormous amount *of
interest which is a consequence of the increase
of our financial obligations.
The evil exists, it cannot be denied. but
how can it be remedied? That is a question
which i.s the subjeet of much discussion and
difference of opinion. It is generally adrnitted
that if our two great systerns of railway were
operated and administered by onlv one body,
this would remove the principal causes of the
evil complained of. But how can that be
done? To w'hicha body should be confided
the administration and operation of the united
railways? "The Government, through nationalization," say sorne people. 'By the Canadian Pacifie Railway," say others. "By cooperation," affirmn certain important mon and
newspapers. It is in order to elucidate that
question that 1 demr it opportune to make
the present motion. I arn convin.ced that

the Sonate ought to give evidence of its zeai
for the interests of the country and show
that it lias the ability required to discuas one

of the greatest problemns of our political and
financial

world.

Cornmittee,

I

arn convinced

that the

after having heard experts

in

financial and railway matters, would make a
report whic'h would be appreciated and do

honour týo the Sonate.
I regret that I did not make this motion
sooner; but, in vieOw of what is going on, in
another Chamber, I have reason to believe

that the Committýee will have ample time to
inquire and report.
I have often said and written in some of
our newspapers that the Sonate was composed
of mon able to, trea't ail the important questions whicha nay arise in our politiýcal world,

and I am convinced that the financial situation
of our railways is one of those questions whicha
will gîve it an opportunity to as9sert its

usefulness.
My name.

I move the motion standing in

Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Honourable gentlemen,
I do not wish to urge any objection to the

purpose for which this Committee is about
to be appointed, but I suggest to the honourable gentleman that the personnel of this

Committee is nlot very happily chosen.

I

notice that the proposed Committee of f ourteen members includes only four from Western Canada. only one heing fromn the Province
of Saskatchewan, whicha is the third largest

province in the Dominion, and the province

APRIL 30, 1925
in which probably the greatest amount of
railway construction is necessary. I think the
Comffmittee thus formed will ibe badly prejudiced from the start, andi I would suggest
te the honourable gentleman the advisability
of recasting it to somne extent, so that further
representation on this Committee may be
given to Western Canada.
Hon. Mr. DAVID:
In comýposing the
Committee consideration was given to the
population of each province; so the province
of Quebec is representeti by four members,
the province of Ontario by four, and the other
provinces eaeh by one. We did the best we
could. If it is thought necessary now to
mod-ify the motion, I have no objection. I
do not know how it is to ibe done. I will
flot atteinpt to do it, because I cannot do
better than I have done.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Ail I can, say is that
the report of the Committee, whaýteiver it
may be, will not command very much respect
in the country if the -composition of the
Committee is left in the présent state.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: It is important tc
oonsider the question fromn the point of viev
of the différent sections of the country.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
Honourable
gentlemen. I would suggest to the mover that
the wording of the motion beé changed. It
is désirable that the scope of the Committee's
inquiry shoulti be reasonably wide, but that
it should not go further than necessary. The*
words, "the best means to relieve the country
from its ruinous railway expenditure," indicate
a pretty large order. It may well be doubteti
whether it is possible to accomplish that. I
would suggest that those words be struck out,
and that the words, "the operations of the
Canadian National Railways," be substituted.
Then the Committee would have ail the scope
needeti, andi it would not raise the hopes of the
country too high.
Hon. Mr. BEAIJBIEN:
Hlow would it
read?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH (read-*ng):
That a Comninitteeaio the Senate be appointed to
inquire into and report upon the operations of the
Canadian National Railways, with power to send for
pemnos, papera and records.

It now reads:
That a Commnittee of the Senate be appointed to
inquire into and report upon the bust meaaa
to
relieve
the country
frorm its ruinous
railway
expenditure.

Thait is a very large order, and if at the
end of the whole inquiry the Cornmittee do
not bring in a solution, it wouli look as if
the Comiinittee's labours had been in vain.

Hon. Mr. BEJJCOURT: But my honourable frienti must see at once, fromn the
observations which were made by the lionourable gentleman who proposeti the Commitee, that that would be killing the very
object of the inquiry. The honouiable gentleman fromt Mille les (Hon. Mr David)
apparently does not intend that the inquiry
shoulti be confineti to the operations of the
Canadian National Railways: he wants the
Çommittee to investigate generally the
question of railway operation in Canada, and
Vo discover, if possible, means whereby the
two systems might be amalgainatcd, or might
Vo a certain extent have a remmon management, or questions of that kinti. I jutige from
what he has tolti us that that is the main
object he bas in view.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
My honourable
friend will at once see that the scope andi
purpose would be unduly limited if the motion
were changed as suggested.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Quite sa.
I
entirely xnisunderstood the purpose of the
motion.
If it is ta inquire into the wholc
railway situation in Canada, that is a rtili
larger order; but if the honourable gentleman
feels that a useful purpose would be served
thereby, I have no objection. I thought lie
was confining himself to the Canadian National
Railways.
Hon. Mr. DAV.ID: In order Io be agreeable to the House, I would have no objection
ta suspending the motion. But do not forget.
honourable gentlemen, that ft is already late
in the Session, and if you want Vo have an
inquiry and a report, and improved conditions,
we must proceed as quickly as possible.
I
would have no objection to doing what the
honourable member from Saskatchewan (Hon.
Mr. Laird) bas suggested, but I do not know
how. If he has something ta propose ta mie,
let him do it.
But I cannot do better
myself.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable gentlemen, I would like ta make
one criticism. It is a milti one.
It struelr
me when the motion was being reati that the
word "ruinous" was a pretty .trong word. I
am going to suggest ta my honourable frieud
from Mille Iles that the word "excessive"
sbould he substituteti.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: I have no objection.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable gentl emen, I would sii.gest that this, motion he
allowed ta stand until Tuesday next, until
we have had an opportunity to consider it.

SENATE
So far as the motion in its present form is
concerned, I would not like to have it proceeded with, because it is practically an admission on the part of the Senate that we
have a ruinous state of affairs existing.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But I would
draw my honourable friend's attention to the
suggestion which has just been made.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I did not catch it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That the word
"ruinous" be replaced by the word "excessive."
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I am not just sure
of that, either. I think this is a very important matter. The question raised by the
honourable member from Regina (Hon. Mr.
Laird) is one worthy of consideration, and
there may be other sections of Canada that
would like to have representation on a Committee of this character.
We shal have
plenty of time to deal with this matter, and
I think the motion might very well stand
until we have a full opportunity to consider
its purport and the membership of the Committee which is to be constituted.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I also believe
that it would be opportune to postpone the
discussion of this motion; but in the meantime I would suggest to my honourable friend
from Regina that he consider the basis upon
which the Committee should be formed. If
he thinks that Saskatchewan is entitled to a
larger representation, he will have to meet
a similar demand from other provinces. Honourable members of the Senate who have objections to fernulate concerning either the form
or the substance of the motion, might get
into touch with the honourable the imover
before Tuesday evening, so that on Wednesday we may have the result of the joint
wisdom of those honourable members.
Hon. Mr. CHAPAIS: Honourable gentlemen, for the word "ruinous" perhaps we
might substitute the word "heavy."
No
doubt the expenditure is very heavy.
Hon.
derous.

Mr.

LYNCH-STAUNTON:

Pon-

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: You do not need
any adjective at all. Certainly it should not
be superlative.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Strike out the
adjective.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Why not Say
simply "expenditure"? If I understand the
honourable member from Mille Iles (Hon.
Hon.

Mr. DAVID.

Mr. David), his intention is to have a thorough
discussion on the whole subject. He does not
want to confine it in any one direction: he
has no particular hobby to press on the Committee. He wants to see the Committee
seized of the whole railway situation in Canada, and he invites members of this House
to apply their ingenuity and experience in
designing some way out of the difficulty,
either temporary or permanent, partial or general. He wants to see the House seized of the
whole problem, and, if I may say so, he is
taking the wise course in asking for a Committee to deal wiýth it, and not the House,
because the Committee would have the advantage of hearing experts and witnesses.
To-day there is a discussion going on in
the press and I think it is desirable that
the whole House should know what is in
the balck of the head of Sir Henry Thornton
-what is his scheme, what it is that he now
proposes. I think the idea of the investigation is a most timely one. I have not had
the advantage of conferring with my honourable friend, but I can at once see the great
public interest involved in the matter. and the
urgency of a solution and I think the House
ought to welcome the opportunity for such a
momentous investigation as my honourable
friend has set before the Senate. There does
not seem to be any difficulty in having the
motion put through to-day, and if it is desired to add any other honourable gentlemen to the Committee I have no objection,
and I am quite sure my honourable friend
has none. He adopted a certain basis of
selection which he has explained, but if there
is any better mode of constituting the Committee, surely it is up to the honourable
gentlemen who think so to suggest it, whatever it may be. My honourable friend from
Regina (Hon. Mr. Laird) does not like the
composition of the Committee. Perhaps he
could tell us what he would like, and then
we would be able to have the motion passed,
so that the Committee could organize and get
to work. There is no doubt that the motion
involves a tremendous task, which will take
all the time available for the Committee to
deal with it properly.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I understand that this
Committee was selected on the basis of population. I would like that it should be based
on the principle of representation. That, I
think, would come nearer to fair play.
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: It is on that
basis now.

APRIL 30, 1925
Hon, W. B. ROSS: No, it is on the basis
of population, as 1 understand it. In this
Hanse the West has 24 members, Ontario 24,
Quebec 24, and the Maritime Provinces 24.
Let the menibers of this commnittee be selected
in proportion ta these numbers. With regard
to the word "muinous," I would suggest sub..
stituting the word "heavy," so that the motion
would read, "ta relieve the country frorn its
heavy railway expenditure.Y We cannot relieve it from its railway expenditure altogether: nobody hapes for that.
Han. Mr. BELOOURT: Why not adopt
the suggestion of my right honourable friend,
ta use 'the word "excessive"? I do not thinc
thet hurts anybody.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOS'PER:
Instead of "excessive" you miglit use the word
"unnecessery." I do flot think we can ever
get rid of the railways, and the expenditure
for thern which is absolutely necessary, but we
ought ta try to relieve ourselves frorn any
expense that is unnecessary.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Those womds are simply
prejudging the whole questiion by saying that
the expenclitures are excessive, or that they
are ruinons. But if you ask the Cornmittee
ta investigate whether the country can be
relieved fmom any part of its heavy railway
expenditure, you leave the whole matter open
for discussion.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I amn surprised that
there are members, even in this Hanse, who
want to elirninate the word "«ruinous," because
I do not believe they are at ail in accord
with the present railway palicy. I do nat think
the word "excessive" meets the case et ail. For
my part 1 arn perfectly ready ta see the word
"muinous" left there. As ta the -Cammittee,
there rnay be some difference of opinion, but
I arn surprised ta find that there is a man
within these four walls who is prepared ta say
that the poliicy the railways are pursuing in
Canada is anything but muinous.,
Hon. Mm. MoME£ANIS: That does not epply
ta the 'Canadien Pacifie Railway.
Hon. Mr. -GORDON: It applies ta the
duplication.
Hon. Mr. RjOBERTSON: Speakîng franly
ta the motion of my honoumable f riend, I
think it cen be stated as a fact that the
liabilàties of Canada have been increased by
approximately S100AMO,oeO during the 'lest
twelve months, arising out of railwey complications. It is also true that the executive
head of the Canadian National Railway has
been rnaking sorne publie suggestions witb
refemence ta co-operation with the Canadien

183

Pacifie Railway, its great competitor, or mutuel
action with a view ta reducing operating casta.
On the other hand, we have had in another
place a rather spinited speech by a prarninent
member advocating sibsalute amalgamation
and consolidation of the two lines under
National menagement.
1 arn heartily in accord with what is
behind my honourable friend's motion,
namely, the fear that the public mind will
be entirely et sea, on the subjeet unles
there is sorne comprehensive and definite
investigation muade. It seezns ta me also that
this House can properly and effectively make
snch an inquimy, pemheps ta the greater
satisfaction of the country et large then could
enother House, where political oonsiderations
miglit be more prominent.
As ta the personnel of the Coxnmittee, any
memober may an mefiection, and consideretion
of the matter et a leter date move an addition ta or a change in the Cornmittee, but
I would not like ta see the investigation
delayed, as it would lie were we not ta deal
with the motion to-day. I would lil<e ta see
the motion passed, probebly chenging the
word "ruinous " ta "nunnecessary." Later on,
if any memiber desires e change made in
the mernbership of the Committee, that cen
be doue.
I think I cen
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
make a suggestion which will perliaps meet
the variaus idees which have been expressed.
I would suggest ta my honourable friend that
lie change the word "minous" ta the word
"heavy," and thet lie add the words "with
the riglit toaedd ta their number."
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I wauld suggeet that the railway mileage cf the different
provinces might well be considered.
Hon. MT. LAIR.D: Befare this discussion
closes I. wish ta dissociate myseli froin any
parochial attitude ini this miatter. In this
country we prctably go too fer, when discnssing public questions, in reising local issues,
provincial houndaries, etc. But ta my mind,
this is e matter not sa mucli of provincial
as of national importance. We propose ta
investiýgate the situation which exists throughout Caneda, end the Cornmittee thet is
proposed for that'purpose comiprises fourteen
memibers, of whorn ten corne from Eastern
Canada and anly four from Western Canada.
As I said, I do not wish ta be narrow or
provincial in this metter; but the relpresentation on the Conumittee seem to me a little
unf air. If the Honse desires ta, pea the
motion to-day, I think mny objection would
be met if the mover would edd the ansme.

SENATE

of the Hon. Mr. Turriff, the Hon. Mr.
Bradbury, and the Hon. Mr. Mitchell. That
would give three more members on the Committee to Western Canada. I would so move.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I have no
objection to an enlargement of the Committee; but simply rise to say that the
statement my honourable friend makes is
somewhat unfair when he says there are four
from the West and ten from the East. He
shculd not forget that the word "East" on
his lips represents a very- wide area. I
have always thought that in these matters
the country could be divided into at least
three sections. When we speak of the East
there are the Maritime Provinces, which, as
we all know, have views on railway matters
quite distinct from those of Ontario and
Quebee.
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
Honourable
gentlemen, I understand that it is the pleasure
of the House that the motion be amended by
striking out the word "ruinous" in the second
line, and substituting the word "heavy," and
that at the end of the motion there be added
the words, "with power to add to their number." That being agreed to, I will put the
motion in that form.
The motion, as amended, was agreed to.

SECOND

READINGS

Hon. Mr. HAYDON moved the second
reading of Bill 21, an Act respecting the
Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of Canada, Limited.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Will the honourable gentleman explain the Bill?
Hon. Mr. HAYDON: The Bill, as honourable gentlemen know. has passed the
House of Commons. In the Railway Committee of that House some amendments were
made placing the control of rates in the hands
of the Railway Board.
The Company was first incorporated in
1903.
This Bill asks that the name be
changed from "The Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of Canada, Limited," to
"The Canadian Marconi Company."
Another clause of the Bill is intended to
reduce the par value of the shares of the

Company from $2.50 to $1.00. This is a
matter of internal economy, and one for the
shareholders, and the validation of Parliament is asked for.
Section 3 of the Bill provides for a change
in wording, if the validation is granted, the
new wording following that of the Loan Companies Act. Then there is a section giving
the Company power to carry on the business
of wireless telephony. its rates to be subject

to the control of the Railway Board, rather
than, as before, to the control of the Governor in Council.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

CANADA EVIDENCE BIL
SECOND READING

-

Han. Mr. McMEANS moved tbe second
reading of Bill W, an Act ta amend the Canada. Evidence Act ais regards the Pvidence of
persans cbarged witb offences.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Explain.
Han. Mr. McMEANS: Honourable gentle.
mnen, this is a very important Bill1, baving
ta do with the question of evidence given by
accused persans. Tbe law of Canada as it is
to-day allows an accused parson ta give
evidence an bis own bebaîf, and if he does not
do so tbat fact may nat be commented upon
by eitber the judge or the prosecuting counsel.
If be gives evidence he may bc bubjected ta
a cross-examination as ta any prPviaus convictions against him. In Englatnd tbe practice
If an accused persan
is entirely different.
gives evidence on bis own bebaîf in England,
be cannot be a.sked whether be bas beon
previously convicted or flot except in particular cases; but if he does not take the
witn-ess stand the judge may comment upon
that fart. The purpýose of tiis Bill is ta
bring aour practice into confonity witb the
English practice.
I have nat introduced this Bill ëolely of my
own motion; I bave discussed it Nwitb a very
eminent judge wbo has bad a great deal of
experience in criminal matters, ind wbo is
very strangly of the opinion th.7t aur Ik.w
Thert;
sbauld be the same as the Englishi La.
was a case at Red Deer which cau-ed a great
deal of comment, the press of -ihe country

185

devoting an entire page ta it. A Dane,
passing ttbrough a smail village late at night
on his way ta a lumfber mill, saw a light, in a
house-it appears that the woman of the house
was out at some littie entertainanent, and that
her husband was in bed-and he walked into
the house, as far as we know now, evidently
intending to sleep there. The woman came
back, and when he saw 'her he rushed. out
of the bouse; .she calIed her huEhand, who
juniped out of bed; there was a tussie between the tw.o men, and the foreigner used
a knife and killed the other man, who had
a large family of children depending upon
him. The Dane was pursued and overtaken
a few miles out of town; he w:ls surprised
and arrested, and was tried for murder. The
jury faund him guilty. Then they a.ppealed,
and the question came up, "Why was he
flot called or why did he flot give evidence
on bis own behalf?" His counsel had refused
ta allow hua, ta go into the box ta explain
anything, and the reason given ta the Court
of Appeal was that there had been some
convictions against hMm in the country fr&rm
which he came. He was the only persan
who could give any evidence of what had
really oacurred, but in doing so he would
be subject ta cross-exainatiofl. The case
was heard by the Court of Appeal in
Alberta, and I may say, with the greatest
deference ta the gentlemen wbo composed
that Court, that tbey made a mistake.
Counsel for the prisoner asked that bis evidence be taken. The Court of Appeal followed
the English decision that, wbere such evidence
is flot callýed in tbe first instance, the Court
of Appeal cannot be expected ta listen ta it,
and the Court said they cauld not take the
evidence. Hawever, they did allow counsel
for the defence ta state what the evidence
would have been if the prisoner had been put
into the box, and they remîtted the sentence.
Instead of finding the prisoner guilty of murder tliey sentenced him ta five years in penitentiary. That judgment did flot meet with
the approval of the community, because it
was feit that the Court should have ordered
a new trial.
The rcason why a prisoner, if alloiwed ta go
into the box, will not take advantage of that
privilege. as it may be called, ia that if there
is a prior conviction against bim he is afraid
of two t1iings: first, that the jury will flot
believe bim; and, secondly, and probably the
more imiportant, that a very severe sentence
wvi1l be imposed tipon him in the event of bis
being found guilty.
There is really no protection ta the prisoner
if be does not go into the box. Although the

SENATE
law piovides that neither the judge nor the
prosecuting counsel may comment upon that
fact to the jury, yet the jury are there and
are aware of it. They know that a prisoner
rnay give evidence if he so desires, and the
provision that his refusa] to do so may not be
comrmented upon does not. in my opinion,
afford very much protection, becaulse the jury
drnw their own conclusions. If we follow
the English practice, in which the accused
cannot be cross-examined on previous convictions except in the particular cases I have
.iust read, there is no excuse whatever for
the accused not giving evidence and, if lie
does flot go into the box, the judge may
comment to the jury upon the fact that the
prisoner, having the privilege of giving evidence, has not donc so.
It is not my intention to press te have
the Bill pqissed this year. My desire is that,
it should ba referred to a ,Special Comýmittee
of this Huse, to take such means as may
be deemned advisable to collect facts. The
Bill can ha sent out to the judges throughout
the country and to the different Attorneys
General. When their answers and opinions
corne back-which wilil be, of course, next
vear-the Bill can be re-introduced and we
shall then have the advantage of their
expericoýce.
A similar procedure was followed in connection with a former Bui
presented in this House with regard to
c-riminal appealýs. The inquîry took two or
three years. Every Chief Justice and every
Attorney Ceocrai in Canada had a ýcopy of
the Bill, and the Committee had the
advantage of their c'xperience and opinions
in comîing to a conclusion.
lIon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I suggest that,
if it is the desire of the Senate to refer
this Bill to a Special Committea, when the
Bill itself is distributed to the various
Attorneys General and judges, it should be
arcompanied by the remnarks of my honourable friand.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
I do not think
that will be at ail necessary.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Before we proceed, will you allow me to say that I helieve 1 express the sentiment of ail the members of this -Chamber in welcoming Sir James
Lougbeed back amongst us. It is a very great
satisfaction indeed for us ail -to flnd hirm in
his old form. I may tell him that we ail
felt quite lonesome during his absence.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, it i2 more than difficultalmost impossible-to gîve voiýce to one's feelings on an occasion like the present, particularly after such very kind sentiments -have
heen expressed. I feel that I cannot repay the
indebtedness which I owe to my colleagues in
the Senate for the sympathy, kindness, and
conoideration which they extended to me during îOy illncss. I need not say that this was
done entirely without regard to the side of
the House on which we sit. It was especially
touching to me that no distinction was ohserx cd in the kindness of my fellow Senators
during that time. If there is anything that
woiild compensate a man for suffering a severe
illness, it is the sympathy andi the kindness
which are expreesed by his friands froma time
te timne uinder those trying circumstanees, and
I may say that I have realized that to the
fulil. I had the opportunity to form. a new and
enlarzed view of the humanity and the gondne-ss of my felhlow-men, and I assure you, honourable gentlemen, that as long as I live I
shall cherish the rnemory of the very sympathetic ýconsideration which was shown to me

Hon. Mr. DANDURANID: I have no answer for the honourable gentleman, hecause
his inquiry goes back to somne turne prior to
the organization of the Canadian National
Railways, and the data must be ohtained from
other sources. It may take some time for
the information to be procured for the preceding years. If the honourable gentleman
intends only to cover the adimistration of

precedent, or that it is right Vo publish a list
of all the applicants.
As to question No. 5, I would readily coinmunicate the answer to iny honourable friend
privately, but would not like to put it on
Hansard, because then it -would be open Vo
publie examination, and in thousands of cases
we would have someihody asking for the liste
of the various aspirants and their ratings,
which I do noV believe would be conducive
to the good and efficient service of the Civil
Service administration.
As to No. 6, I give to my honourable friend
the list of the candidates, from which he can
Only three

candidates qualified for oral examination as

the nature and prices of the co'mmodities
used in manufacturing and the manufactures

perceptive faculties.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I suppose my.honourable friend can Vell me if this man Jackson who was ýtemporarily filling the place was

CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS'
RADIO PLANTS
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. LYNOH-STAUNTON
of the Government:
1. What

3. What
4. What

inquired

is the cost to date of all radio plants in
with the Canadian National Railways?
is the monthly cost of operation of said
is the monthly revenue derived therefrom?
comnercial purpose do these plants serve?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
1. The capital cost of Radio broadcasting
stations owned by the Canadian National Railways at March 31, 1925, was $40,324.08. This
amount includes $18,259.59 for the Ottawa
station, $22,058.17 for the Moncton station and
$8.32 in connection with the Vancouver
station.
2. Monthly cost of operating these stations
is: Ottawa, $1,579.13; Moncton, $987.18.
3. No direct revenue, but the Management
have ample proof, based upon reports from
their Traffic Department, that the advertising
obtained by the aid of these stations has resulted in increased earnings for the railways.
During the month of January, 1925, there were
broadcasted ten programmes from the Ottawa
station; the Management received 3,122 telegrams, cards and letters acknowledging the
broadcasts, or an average of 312 per concert.
The acknowledgments were received from all
sections of Canada, practically the entire
United States, and Cuba.
The average number of communications received per broadcast from the station at Moncton is 350. These are received from the
Maritime Provinces, Newfoundland, New
England States, Quebec and Ontario, etc. In
a recent mail the officials received at Moncton
fourteen letters from the British Isles acknowledging receipt of the broadcast, and it is fair
to assume that the interest displayed by the
recipients will result in increased business to
the railway.
4. Advertising and publicity.
NOVA SCOTIA COAL MINES DISPUTE
DISCUSSION AND

INQUIRY

Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON rose in accordance with the following notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate to the
serions conditions in the coal mining districts of Nova
Scotia, and inquire what if any action the Government
intend to take in order to bring about a settlement
of the dispute between the Miners and The British
Empire Steel Corporation.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, in bringing this question to the attention of the

Senate, I do so without any intention of
making a critical analysis of the difficulty in
Nova Scotia, and without any intent or desire
to condemn or approve the actions of either
party to the dispute. I do respectfully suggest, however, that this is a situation that deserves the attention of Parliament, and perhaps
more serious consideration at the hands of the
people of Canada than it has received
up to the present time, because some
time since it reached a point when it
was no longer a local industrial dispute,
but had become a matter of public interest

Canada

far

re-

moved from the scene of the dispute itself.
That is the particular reason why I make bold
to bring this subject to the attention of the
Senate, remembering as I do how a similar
situation was created some years ago, and
how it gained momentum as it became the
subject of public knowledge and public interest
the country over, in 1919. It is not desirable
that the people of the country should be
excited or their minds unnecessarily inflamed
over an industrial dispute that may exist in
any locality, because very often misunderstandings and misconceptions arise which it takes
years to straighten out and to eradicate.
I would crave the indulgence of the House for
a few moments to review, in more or less
detail-mostly less, I hope-some of the conditions that I think have led up te the preI remember these partly besent situation.
cause of the fact that for a period of four
years, when a member of the Government,
I had rather intimate knowledge and close
association with this problem at that time.
There is in the province of Nova Scotia a
very well-developed industry in coal and steel,
with a capacity far in excess of the market
available for the finished product of the industry. I think it is true to state that since
wartime more miners and more mines have
been available for operation and employment,
That
than the market at present justifies.
is one of the reasons why it has been difficult,
and most of the time impossible, to give
reasonable continuity of employment to several
thousand men who ought to have been steadily
In this connection I desire to

connect up the Federal Government itself,
and to suggest to my honourable friend the
leader of the Government that the Federal
authorities might interest themselves in that
phase of the problem.
There has been established in Canada a
means whereby it was expected-and I think
that expectation has been realized to a large
degree-that returned soldiers would be placed
on land. Among the miners of Cape Breton
there are something like 4,000 returned soldiers,

MAY 5, 1925
very many of whom were bon and reared on
Nova Scotia farms, and who have had experience in and knowledge of f armi life, and
It occurs to me that it would be

rendering a good service, not only to thein but
to the whole community and to the country at
large, if special attention and effort were
directed towardls placing a number of those
men in other parts of Canada, where there is
more reasonable prospect of them being
successful, taking advantage of the Soldier
Settiement seheme, or something equivalent to
it.
In 1909 there was a long-drawn-out industrial dispute in this same territory. It lasted
something like six months-during a whole
winter. And I found in 1918, when investigat.mng the situation as it then existed, that
much of the difflculty and misunderstanding
wau the outeome of that long and bitter
struggle that had occurred in 1909, the memory
of which was still fresh in the minds of many
of those men.
1 found in 1918 that it was neeasary to
endeavour to have all concerned forget tihe
past, -and look at their mutual interests as
they existed at that time, and to look forward
to the future of the industry, rather than
to fight over what was then rnerely history.
The situation in the mining areas in Nova
Scotia in 1918 was that the production of
coal had so decreased in quantity that there
was not sufficient coal to meet the then existing deinand. The Goverument of Canada,
through its then Prime Minister, requested
the Dominion Iron and Steel Company, as
the produ-eing company was then known, to
increase the production in order te accommodate sliips that were then i Halifax and
Sydney Harbours waiting for bunker coal but
loaded for overseas. The president of the
Dominion Coal Company stated to the Prime
Minister in my hearing that the difficulty
was that the miners in Nova Scotia were wilfully and voluntarily restricting the production
of coal. That seemed to me an inconceivable
situation, and in discussing it with the president of the company in the presence of the
Prime Minister and one or two imembers of
the then Government, it developed, on investigation of figures produced, that instead
of there being a decrease ini the production
of each man per day there liad been an actual
increase of approximately eeven-tentha of a
ton per man per day. The Tiscalculation
had arisen because the calculation was orginally based on the total number of men arnployed in ail departments of the mine, and
not on the number of men actually engaged
in the production of coal.

191

That was in
Hon. Mr. DA.NDURAND:
1918?
That was in
Hon. Mr. RLOBERTSON:
1918. Investigation at that time further revealed the fact that the compensation paid
to coal employees in Nova Scotia had not
increased in anything like proper proportion
or in proper relation to the increase in the
cost, of living, or the increase i wages to
workmen generally since the outbreak of the
war up to that time. The Halifax shipyards
had been largely extended, and a number of
other important industries had been established in the Maritime Provinces; labour was
in demand, and men could get more money
working in the sunlight and in the free air
than by going under the ground to dig coal.
Being human like all the rest of us, they fait
inclined to work where they would get the
best wages under the most satisfactory conditions. Therefore it was necessary to increase the compensation of those men in proportion to the increase granted to labourera
genaraliy by reason of war conditions.
In discussing that, first with a committea
representing the men and the manager of the
Company at Sydney, and subsequently with
the Board of Directors of the whoie Company
at Montreai, a tentative agreement was
reached, subject to confirmation by the represantatives of the men and the men thamselves,
which was subsequently obtained, and an adjustment of what threatened to be an acute
situation was brought about in 1918.
It is true that the adjustment at that time
left the compensation of the Nova Scotia
miners approximately 30 per cent below the
prevailing rates for similar workers in other
miming areas of Canada and the UJnited States.
However, I would submit that that was not
aitogether unreasonable, because of the fact
that prior to the war and up to that time the
cost of living in our Maritime Provinces had
not been as high as in other parts of Canada.
In addition to that, everyone who knows anything about the Nova Scotia mining area
knows that the cost of producing coal and
bringing it to the surface in that area is much
greater than in other areas where coral is mined.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: May I ask my
honourable friend if the minera; were flot provided with houses at that time in addition to
their wages?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTISON: In reply to my
honourable friand I would say that they were
in most cases supplied with wbat were called
bouses. In some cases they were perbaps
reasonably comfortable, but in the large majoi-

192

SENATE

ity of cases I am sure my honourable friend
would agree, if he saw them as I did, that
they were not what would be termed reasonably comfortable homes for workmen. But
that is aside from the question that is before
us now.
A further settlement was made in 1919 by
direct negotiation between the employers and
the miners, and gradually, but constantly,
an attempt was made, with some success, to
restore the lost confidence and to establish the
feeling of trust in each other which was necessary to the satdsfactory carrying on of the
industrv.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
What
cause of that want of confidence?

was the

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think i eiplained that a few minutes ago.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The difference in
wages?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No; the trouble
in 1909, when men had been shot down in
cold blood, and their families thrown out on
the street. I think I said that in 1918, when
this problem came before us again, the bitterness that existed from 1909 was still present.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I understood that,
but my honourable friend did not explain
what was the cause of the difficulty in 1909.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I beg the honourable gentleman's pardon. Now, in 1920 againbecause their contracts were renewed, with
some little variations, by agreement in 1918,
1919, and 1920, and the agreement of 1920
was made to run till December lst, 1921-over
a period of those four years, from 1918 to
1921, there was a constant advan-ce in the
direction of overcoming that distrust and creating confidence, and of making agreements
which both parties respected and carried to
their conclusion.
On December 31st, 1921, the agreement expired. They attempted to negotiate a new one
together in 1922 and failed. At least there
was an effort made to maintain the same relationship and encourage it, but a strike was
called. somewhat suddenly, and almost before the strike was called military forces were
thrown into Nova Scotia. I do not intend
to go into the details of the history of that.
It was contended strongly at the time that it
was wholly unnecessary.
Again, in 1923, as honourable gentlemen will
remember, all the standing army of Canada
fronm Winnipeg east was thrown into Nova
Scotia-cavalry,
infantry
and
artillerya period of several weeks. I want to say to
lion. Mr. ROBERTSON.

this House that it is my firm belief that that
policy was not calculated satisfactorily to
settle and adjust industrial disputes, or to
encourage co-operation and inspire confidence
as between employer and employee.
I am not going to enter into a debate or
argument as to whether or not it was necessary to take that action on the part of the
Government, except to point out this clear
fact, that last year Parliament changed the law
and made it necessary and compulsory that
the Attorney General of a Province should
requisition military aid before it would be
sent into a Province, for the party requisitioning the aid would have to bear the cost.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Who asked for the military aid before?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
The aid was
asked for by the County Judge in Cape
Breton.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The Department of. Defence had no option but to answer
the call.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am not complaining of what was done, but I want to
point out how unnecessary it was. This year
there has been a struggle going on down there
for two months.
Troops could not be sent
unless requisitioned by the Attorney General.
They have not been so requisitioned, but
notwithstanding
that approximatoly 28,000
people are on the verge of starvation, certainly
in dire want, there has not been one dollar's
worth of property destroyed, or one bit of
injury done to an individual. It seems to me
that that is the most eloquent proof that it was
unnecessary and a mistake to rush the military
forces of Canada into Cape Breton in two
successive years to make at least a display of
force against those apparently quitely disposed and peaceable men.
I want to make one other observation. In
my opinion there are too few Federal laws that
have for their object the binding together of
the various parts of this widespread and farflung Dominion.
One of those laws was the
Industrial Disputes Investigation Act, in force
from 1907 until last year.
The people of
British Columbia and of Nova Scotia were
equally interested in the operation and administration of that law and its effects, and
it was one of the few pieces of legislation
outside of criminal law that affected people
equally in every part of the country.
By reason of the action of the Federal
Government in sending all the military forces
east of Winnipeg to Cape Breton in 1923, a
little industrial dispute arose in the hydroelectric field in Ontario, and the Minister of

MAY 5,1925
Labour stated, I think i 'n Parliament, that
the reason why lie insisted upon the establishnment of a Board of Conciliation ini that ca~se
-which subsequently led to, the 'litîgation
which destroyed the Act-waa because there
was no military force available in Ontario, and
lie anticipated and feared a riot in Toronto.
Therefore the loss of the Industrial «Disputes
Act of Canada lies directly at the door of those
responsible for taking that action which

brouglit about that resuit.
time Canada lias a riglit toi feel glad, and
indeed relieved, that the amendment to the
Militia Act made last year lias shown itself
Vo be so wise and satisfactory in its operation.
Now, advancing a step further, as to
whether either Provincial or Federal Government should have come to the aid cf these
distressed people in Nova Scotia, at first siglit
one would say no-that the Govermment ought
flot to dispense charity Vo people in a particular locality; that it is not 2, good practice.
With that view one iniglit be in accord if
there was no responsibility on the part of
the Government for bringing about the situation which required the assistance or relief.
During the whole period from 1918 to 1924
t.he Fedeiral Goveniment, through its Department of Labour, feit an interest in, and apparently did everything it could to rnaintain
and establish, industrial peace in that locality,
until 1921, when the activities of the Militia
Department were added, and the Governimnent
of Canada apparently became more deeply
interested in the steel and coal industry than
,ever before. But suddenly, in 1925 they turn
around and say: "IV is none of our 'business;
you can starve, you -can do anything you like,
but it is none of our concern, and we a-re noV
going teo help." 1 must leave it Vo the Goviernment to give its9 own explanation, if it
sees fit Vo give any, for that change of attitude; but I think, to say the least, it is
very uxnsual, and indeed a matter that ouglit
to lie explained, wliy ne reasonable effort lias
been made Vo follow in the direction of conciliation and if possible arbîtration of the
dispute tliat is becorning a rnatter of public
importance far outside the locality wliere it
exists.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would the lionouraible gentleman kindly e*plain what has
been the change of attitude of tlie Federal
autliorities, outaide of the change whicli came
about from the alteration in tlie law which
my lionourable friend appiloves? Because
tlie sending of inilitia was noV the act cd the
Federal authorîties; it wa.s tlie law which
forced tlie Federal Government Vo answer the
S-13

193

cali when it was made by the local authoriies.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I must respectfully diffier with my honouraible friend the
leader of the Govermsent as Vo it. being necessary Vo comply witli the request of the judge
in Nova Scotia to send the roops that were
sent; and for two reasons: firat, I do not
think that it was within tlie power or jurisdiction of that gentleman Vo requisition troops
outside of the military district in. whicli lie
was located; second. I do noV think it was
within his jurisdiction Vo dictate Vo the
Federal Goverument. The Federal Govemnment liad the right Vo exercise its own judgment ove-r its own mulitary forces, as Vo
wliether or flot it was necessary Vo send the
forces that were sought. In Vhe light of
events that have now transpired, it is surely
dlear Vo ahl conceTned that it was never
necessary.
Hon. Mr. DANDUPLAND: But the Government would have Vo, change the law.
No,. Let me
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
point out Vo my honouraible friend wliat
occurred under other Governments and under
similar circumstances. Honourable gentlemen
will recaîl Vhe diffficulty at St. John, N.B.,
where troops were called for. They were not
sent. There were a few Mounted Police sent
Vo preserve order, and Vhey suvceeded in doing
so. I remeinher in the town of Thoro]d, in
rny own county of Welland, in 1920, wliere
the then Attorney General of the Provine
of Ontario hy telephone one day hurriedly
demanded that a substantial force of militia
le sent Vo protect property. We pointed out
Vo him tha thVe Province of Ontario would
be expected Vo bear the expense, and asked
if he thought they needed so many. Wliat
was the resuit? The then Attorney General
of Ontario imrmediately found that it was noV
necessary Vo send militia at all, but was satisfied with 125 .Mounted Police who went over
and preserved order, and in Vhe next twentyfour bours took some fifty-eigit revolvers
from foreigners in Vhe faotory wbo tlireatened
trouble. Therefore I say that there is precedent Vo indicate that Governments have in
Vhe past made soine investigation and exercised judgment before going Vo expense and
stirning up Vhe country by sending the militia
long distances on aceount of trivial industrial disputes.
C.oming more closeily ta 'the troubles that
exist. vo-day, let us see wliat liappened last
year. The British Empire Steel Corporation

pire, I think, on December 31st, 1924, in all
respeicts except one. That agreement provided
that the rates and conditions were to remain
in effect until ithe end of 1924, that a new
agreement should then be negotiat4ed, and that
untid' such new agreement was negotiated, or
while it was in process of negotialtion, in any
case, the maintenance men would be continued on the work. The end of 1924 came. I
see -by a statement issued by the President of
the British Empire Steel Corporation recenitly
that he claims that in the agreement of last
year they increased the wages of the men by
7 per cent. At the end of the year the company took the position that the wages must
be reduced by 10 per cent. The men said:
"No, we will not agree to thait. We have not
had anything like half-time employment during 1924. We are up to the eyes in d&bt at tihe
present time and we cannot meet our obligations. We cannot acoept any reduction in
wages." The employers said, probably with
perfect truth: "The .cost of production exceeds
the price at which we are able to sell the product." We all know that no industry can
carry on if that be true. So the employers
said: "Accept the 10 per cent reduction that
we urge you to take, and we will carry on the
industry, keep it going, and give you ail the
employment possible, and we wild have a
thorough investigation into this whole matter.
When thait is over, we will negotiate a contract." That may not be an accurate descripton of what occurred, but it is the effect of it.
The men said: "No, we will not agree to that,
but we will tell you what we will do: we will
agree to continue to work on the basis of our
1924 wïage scale, according to the agreement
thait we made together last year. Let your
investigation proceed; let it be thorough; let
if be wide; let it go into the financing of this
whole great industry; let us know how much
interest bas to be earned upon the money that
has actua.lly been invested in the property,
and aIl the rest of it. But let the 1924 wage
scale contiinue until that investigation is completed. Then we will discuss a new contract."
The employers said: "We will not accept
that." What then was the dispute up to that
time? It was a question of a 10 per cent reduction in the pay-roll.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: May I ask my
honourable friend if there was a strike on at
the time?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No. Negotiations were proceeding all this time. Then,
when they could not agree, the employing
company, as I recall the facts, made an application for a Board of Conciliation under the
Industrial Disputes Act. The Board was

Mr. ROBERTSON.

established, notwithstanding the fact that the
Act itself had been destroyed; but the men
said: 'It is useless for us to appear." They
sent a written statement, a sort of brief, submitted for the information of the Board, but
they did not appear before the Board. It is
not my business to censure them or to condone what they did. If it had been a case
that I was handling, under other conditions, I
certainly iwould have appeared before the
Board. Be that as it may, they did not.
Then. those negotiations falling through, an
arbitration process was proposed.
I have
already referred to the unhappy experiences
of the men in the past and the lamentable
lack of confidence in their minds towards the
employer. I have reason to believe that a
number of gentlemen connected with the Company were honest in their desire to reach a
satisfactory and fair solution through arbitration methods, but it was not possible to do
so. In my humble opinion, it was largely because of those unhappy past experiences of the
men. Then what happened?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Why was it impossible?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The two parties
could not agree. I say the men had not confidence dn the proposal to arbitrate, and this
lack of confidence was due largely to past experience.
Hon. Mr. BELGOURT: No agreement was
made?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Following that,
a dispute exists as to who is responsible for
what happened. The Company, I understand,
hold that the men went on strike. The men
say that the Company thereupon withdrew the
credit to them in the stores. In many of
these mining towns the mining companies own
the onily store in the place, I am told, and
the men have to do their trading at that store.
They trade on a credit basis and settle by
deductions from their pay. As we know from
authentic accounts that have come to us, they
had not been working enough and had not
been earning enough to pay their blls. Therefore credit was stopped at the company's store,
which the men regarded as equivalent to a
lock-out or an unfriendly act against them,
and they withdrew their services entirely.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Did the companies have all the trade, or were there any
other stores?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: In most mining
towns the companies own the only store in
the place. In Glace Bay there were other
stores.

MAY 5, 1925
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: I think there are
very few places if any, where there is oniy
the Company store.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
I accept the
statement of my bonouraible friend from Sydney, but I also make this observation, that only
Saturday last I understood that there was to
be a meeting held to-day of ail the merchants
in the town of Glace Bay, and that it was anticipated that they would ail go into voluntary
liquidation because they could flot carry on
their business: they had ail extended credit to
the -limit of their abilîty, and could not meet
their obligations.
That brings us up ta a very recent date, two
months ago, when this conflict occurred.
Whether it be a lock-out or a strike matters
not, so far as the solution of the trouble
at the present moment is concerned. The
Prime Minister of Nova Scotia subsequently
made a move, which, no doubt, was perfectly
honest in its intent, but unhappily did not
accomplish much in resuits. He invited the
President of the British Empire Steel Corporation and the President of the United Mine
Workers to meet together-in bis presence, I
assume, because he cailled the conference at
Halifax. Two days were spent in joint discussion of these matters. We have no knowledge of the details of that discussion; al
we know is that it resulted in failure.
I do flot want to weary the House, but desire
to reason this out carefuily and frankly. Let
us for a moment see what woulid be the objections of both parties ta any capnitulation.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Wouid my honourable friend permit me? I hope he does
not mind my interrupting him. What became
of the negotiations begun by -the Prime Minister? What did they result in?
Han. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am just trying
to explain that the Prime Minister invited
these twa gentlemen to sit down with bim and
try to reach a conclusion. None was reached.

Han. Mr. ROBERTSON: I thought I made
it clear ta the House a few minutes ago that
the employers proposed a 10 per cent reduetion in wages and offered to carry on an that
basis.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURrr: I am given to, understand that the Prime Minister of Nova
Scotia proposed a new arbitration. I do nat
know anything about it, but I desire to, obtain
the information. Will they not accept arbitration?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think I made
it clear that they had refused ta accept arbitration.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is, the men
refused?
Han. Mr. ROBERTSON: The Prime Minister of Nova Scotia has 'a Bill before the
Legisiature now, wherein he proposes ta make

Prime Minister to both employers and employees who were before him at the time?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That is probably
so. 1 did not say it was not.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I think it is a rather
important thing ta know.
Hon. Mr. RiOBERTSON: Honourable gentlemen, I stated in reply ta my honourable
friend that the Prime Minister invited these
two representatives ta sit down with him ta
diseuss the situation. They discussed it for
twa days and faiied ta reach any agreement.
Nothing came of the discussion.
Han. Mr. BELCOURT: But it is surely

Hon. Mr. R.OBERTSON: I said that we were
not in a position ta know and did nat know
what the details would be.
Hon Mr. MCOORMIÇX: I can furnish an
explanation with regard ta the statement my
Ihonourable friend is maki-ng, as ta, the differenoe between the employees and the company.
There are two features ta the dispute. The
company demanded a reduction of 10 per
cent, and the men demanded an advance of
10 per cent. During the negotiations, and at
the time =ny honourable friend is speaking
about, when the Premier called them together,
the men had conaented ta forego the 10 per
cent advance that they wee demanding, and

accepted and the men did not.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No.
lon. Mr. MeLENNAN: That was at an
earlier stage. Later it was the reverse.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If my honourable
friend is correct, I have no knowledge of that
fact. What I want to point out now is the
situation existing at the time of the conference which the Prime Minister of Nova
Scotia brought about. There was still between
the parties the difference of 10 per cent, and
10 per cent for only a temporary period, until
a thorough, sweeping investigation into the
whole matter could be made by, I assume,
impartial, disinterested parties.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The parties to abide
by the result.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I would respectfully advance the view that if at any time
in the future an investigation were entered
into, the Commission, or whatever body is
established to make that inquiry, should be
composed of men from outside the Province
of Nova Scotia, not connected in any way
with the interests of either the employer or
the workmen.
The men declined to make any concession
at the meeting with the Prime Ministerwhy? I have pointed out that there was an
agreement made between the men and the
Company in 1924, and the men were only
contending for the continuance of the same
rate. The cost of living, according to the
Labour Gazette, issued to-day, is a little
higher in 1925 than it was a year ago, when
that agreement was negotiated. Therefore,
from the employees' standpoint there was
absolutely no justification for a reduction.
While their living cost was just as high, their
employment had been very irregular indeed.
But they said: "We are willing to carry on at
the 1924 rate and let the status quo continue
until investigation is held. Then, if you can
show us, or if the investigation proves, that
Hon. Mr. McCORMICK.

your statement is true that the cost of production is greater than the receipts obtained,
we shall be prepared to negotiate a further
agreement with you."
It is also to be observed that, although
the Prime Minister, in another place, only
a few days ago, congratulated the people of
Canada, especially householders and workmen,
on the substantial relief that had been effected
by way of reduction in the cost of living
since the present Administration took office,
yet the Labour Gazette for the month of
April, which has come to my hand only today, shows that according to the authentic
statistics of the Department of Labour itself
the cost of living is higher in March 1925
than it was in March 1922, three years ago.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Will my honourable friend tell me what difference there is in
the cost of living?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It is very little.
Would the honHon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
ourable gentleman kindly mention that? It
seems important.
I am making
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
no boast as to the extent of it, as the honourable the Prime M-inister did. Therefore I
do not intend to make the sarne mistake as
he did.
Now, honourable gentlemen, this Nova
Scotia situation is peculiar and unique in one
respect, as compared with the ordinary industrial dispute. It is not simply a dispute hetween an employer operating a property which
he and shareholders own, and his employees,
but there is a third and important party
interested, namely, the people of the Province of Nova Scotia. That Province has for
many years, and very ýproperly so, obtained a
revenue from the production of coal within
its boundiaries. If I remember correctly, the
royalty is 12 cents a ton-I stand to be
corrected if that is not so. During the last
half-dozen years or so the average output of
the mines of Nova Scotia has been 6,600,000
tons a year: let us say in round numbers that
it is 6,000,000 tons a year. If the mines
operate 300 days a year-which they do not,
that would mean a revenue to the Province
of $2,500 a day. If they operated only half
that time, the production would have to be
twice as great in order to produce the same
revenue. But that has been the average production. Therefore the revenue to the Province is approximately half a million or more
dollars per year. The Province of Nova
Scotia is absolutely losing that revenue.
Furthermore, the people of Nova Scotia in
their sympathy are going into their pockets

MAY 5, 1925

u

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: May I ask mXy
honourable friend if fie bas offered bis suggestion to the Prime Minister of Nova Scotia?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I do flot assume
that 1 have the right to offer suggestions to
the Prime Minister of Nova Suotia, nlot being
a resident of that Province and neot being in
any way interested; but, as a public citizen
of Canada, I felt that 1 had the right to bring
tbis matter to the attention of the Government, because it has become of serious import,
not only to the people of the Province of
Nova Scotia, but te the wbole of Canada.
Tberefore I make bold to express the hope
that my bonourable friend the Leader of the
Government in this House will perhaps think
it worth while ta cali the attention of someone-the Premier of Nova Scotia or the Prime
Minister of Canada-to the fact that a suggestion of this sort bas been advaýnced. It
seemsj to me that if that solution were acceptable frein the standpoint of ail concerned,
everybody would win. Tbe men could be
employed .promptly, the mines couid operate,
and the losses that are beîng sustained could
be stopped, and the Province of Nova Scotia
would be getting a littie revenue instead of
taking a dead total loss.
Hon. Mr. PROWSE: I would like to ask
my honourable friend a question. There is
something I am a little puzzled about. Is it
the fault of the miners or the fault of the
British Empire Steel Company that American
coal can be landed in Nova Scotia at a -less
cost than the Nova Seotia coal? It is the
fault of eitber the miners or the Company.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: 1 have no idea
what the icost of coal is, laid down at Sydney,
but I presume that the necessity of getting
it there is in the fact that the steel plant -is
operating, and that the coal mines are not.
Hon. Mr. PROWSE: Is it the fauit of the
Company or the miners?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That is not for
m-e to say. 1 have not any information upon
which to base an opinion.
I would like to conclude with the observation that for two montbe now there has been
a situation wbich. bas been growing more and
more serious, distress which bas been growing
more and more acute, and the two parties te

people wbo are in distress during the continuation of this trouble.
I hold that no good purpose cari be served
by an indefinite continuation of this controversy and struggle, beeause the summer
season is the season when the coal is largely
produced in the Nova Scotia field. And if,
as Mr. Wolvin very properly said, the summer
season goes out with the mines tied up, with
our limited output and our limited market
during winter, distress is bound to be great, and
public cbarity cannot be extended indefinitely.
Mr. Wolvin did not say the latter, but I hold
it is true that public charity cannot be extended indefinitely to so large a number of
people-that the public mmnd will soon turn
in the direction of thinking that there must
be a solution found for this difficulty.
Now, if the Province of Nova Scotia is
interested, as it is, and is losing a revenue of
$2,500 a day se long as tbis struggle continues,
why in the namne of common sense is it not
possible for tbat Province, or someone representing it, or either of the parties te the
dispute to suggest that alI tbree comne into

asking a question publicly that he bas asked
me privately on a number of occasions, and
which I have had pleasure in discussing with
him at considerable length. I would say to
him publicly, as I think I have said privately,
that there is nlo possibility of what might be
termed an absolute guarantee of fulifiment
on the part of either party, except there be
compulsion, and compulsion, I say, is not
a remedy where buman beings are conoerned,
because men in every activity of life demand
at least a certain amount of personal liberty
and freedom of action.
In connection with the railroad, the organizations wit.h which I amn personally connected have for twenty-nine years neyer
broken an agreement, neyer had a dispute
with our employers that has flot been solved
by negotiation. Il we have had ýdîfficulties,
we have agreed t.o submit our disputes to a
tribun-al which. we ouýrselves created, and we
have neyer failed to obtain a satisfactory
,settiement, which Was acceptable to bô>th
parties. I say again to my honourable friend
from Inkerman that that i&-the only, and
in my humble opinion-the best, guarantee
that can, be given to an employer. If bis men
feel an interest in the industry in wbich they
are engaged and are on f riendly terms witb
their employer, as they ought to be, there is
no fear and no doubt of the industry being
able to continue to ýoperate without interruption.
I realize that in the coal mining industry
it is of the utmost importance that the cmployers should be able te accairately estimate
what their output is going to be, beoause they
have to make a selling contract for coal in
advance; and it is a fact, wbich I think ail
honourable gentlemen know, that the United
Mine Workers, witb which these men in Nova
Scotia are connected, have a repuitation extending over forty years of neyer having
voluntarily broken an agreement. Therefore
I hoki that the situation there is much the
saine as that with our railroads, and that if
the samne spirit of friendliness, co-operation,
an-c confidence could be estsblished between
the British Empire Steel Company and its
employees as exists on our railroadsË, for
example, there would be no need of worrying
about guarantees.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The honourable
gentleman. bas told us it is impossible.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I hold that it is
impossible until that confidence can be built
up over a period of years and restored to the
position which it should occupy.

199

Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: In the course of
your speech, d4d you not znean that the
settlement should be, not ten per cent of an
advance on the present wage scale, but the
1924 scale, because the men were ready to
accept the 1924 scale?
Hon. Mr. R'OBERTSON: My thought,
honourable gentlemen, is-I hope I bave made
myselif clear, perhaps I did not-that the
mines should operate and the Comipany pay
the 1924 scale less ten per cent, and that the
Province sbould pay the ten per.cent during
the interregnum, and, that when the investigation is completed, everybody being back at
work and the mines operating, and some
degi.ee of confidence obviouély re.stored, it
should be possible to work out au agreement
or contract on the bauis of the recommendation of tbe commission, and te continue the
industry without any further interruption.
Hon. Mr. PROWSE: I would like te ask
the bonourable gentleman if bie can offer any
solution of the trouble at the present time
existing down there. Why is it possible for
the United States to send coal there in competition with the British Empire Steel Company? I arn not exactly sure whether my
honourable friend is speaking in favour of the
labour or the corporation. Eitber there is
aometbing wrong with the labou-r or with
the Company when the Ulnited States can
send coal to any part of Nova Scotia, New
*Brunswick or Prince Edward Island at 81.20
a ton. less than the British Empire Steel Company can deliver it for. There is something
wrong somewhere, and what it is I would
like to find out, and the public would like
to know.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It is quite probable that if my suggestion were adopted and
proved acceptable, the Commission that would
operate, miglit find an answer to that question. I would not presume to answer it.
Hon, C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable gentlemen, the inatter that has been brought up
by the honourable gentleman wbo bas just
taken bis seat is one of considerable gravity.
Confronting one another you have two very
large groups--thousands of workmen on one
side, and on the other side the largest industrial corporation in tbis country. My honourable friend bas spoken, as usual, with the
mentality which is natural to him. I make
no reproach to him for having it. Hie bas
spoken for the men, and laid their case before
you.* He bas done so in a very moderate way,
and not without bis usual skill.
The country is too deeply interested in the
fight now going on to base its judgment on

SENATE

one side only of the question. If you will
allow me, I shall lay before you, as briefly
as I can, the other side of the matter. I
intend to do it with equal moderation,
imitating in that respect my honourable
friend's example.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I do not desire
to interrupt my honourable friend, but may
I correct him in the impression that I was
attempting to make a presentation of this case
from the standpoint of the workmen? Had I
been attempting to do that, I can assure my
honourable friend that the presentation would
have been quite different. I have been trying
to make a presentation of the facts as I understand them, with a view of a solution in the
public interest, inoluding both the employer
and the workmen. I have no knowledge, nor
have I any reason to believe, that the workmen in Nova Scotia will approve of the views
that I have expressed; and I do not want
the House to have the impression that I was
attempting to make a plea on behalf of those
men involved. I was attempting to place the
situation from the standpoint of what seemed
to me the public interest at this time, and I
hope my honourable friend will recognize that
that was my intention.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Evidently I have
been very obscure in what I intended to say. I
stated that my friend envisaged the question

justified in changing my mind; that still is
my imipression.
In dealing with this question before a body
like this House, the best way is to present the
facts. May I therefore ask you to view with
me what part has been played, on the one
side by the men, and on the other side by
the Company, within these last years of trials
through which both have been passing.
I want you to go back with me to 1921, for
hein the men had reached their goal, that is
to say, the highest wages ever known in the
country. They had a united front; the United
Mine Workers of America had penetrated this
country; they had fortified themselves on eccount of the war and by the war; they had
pushed back capit&l, and increased their wages
unti.l. in 1921 they rang the bell and got the
highest wages they had ever dreamed to get.
But. honourable gentlemen, as the bide rises,
so it recedes. Abnormal conditions must be
followed by normality. It may take more or
less time, but you cannot stop events. Certain conditions go on, and then the reaction
sets in. Since then what have we seen? We
have seen the United Mine Workers of

asked for a certain delay to think the matter
over. It was granted to them. In Dec.ember
a conference took place in Montreal to
discuss wages. The Company showed to the
men that material conditions rendered it
impossible to pay the actual wages; that is
to say, the Company was between the alternative of either lowering the wages or stopping
the sale of their coal. If they did not lower
the wages, who would raise the price of the
coal in the market for them? Therefore they
told the men they could not go on with
existing wages: they would have to reduce
t hem.
What did the men do? They refused to
discuss any reduction whatsoever. After
proper notice, as covered by the contract, the
reduction was made in January 1922. Immediately the men made application to the
for a Conciliation

Board, and Mr. Gillen was named as president
of the Board. both the men and the Company
having chosen ,their representatives. An award
was given by Mr. Gillen. The Company said:
"Very well: the tribunal has been chosen; it
lias judgad; we accept." The men said: "We
refuse."
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Will my honourable
friend permit a question right there? Would
he kindly tell us the wages per day of the
men at that time, and at each time that they
were changed?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: If my honourable
friend will do me the kindness to bear with
me for a few moments, I think he will find
that his question is not at all necessary. What
is important is the wages of today, whatever
were the wages of yesterday or of the day
before.
The United Mine Workers, after having
turned down this award, requested a conference in Montreal. It was granted to them.
Their ofticers went there and negotiated,
and made and signed an agreement. One oi
those men, as honourable gentlemen will remember, was McLachlan; he was at the time

they repudiated the agreement, and the radical

which states that whether a lockout or a
strike takes place those maintenance mon are
bound in honour to, stay and do their duty.
They were taken away.
In 1922 and 1923 there were two increases
in wages. The last one was equal to 7 per
cent cf the men's wages. Now I will answer
my honourable friend. A moment ago I spoke

"We cannot carry on; you wihl have to accept
a reduction of, broýadly speaking, 10 per cent."
The mon retaiated by saying: "We want an
increase of 10 per cent."

201

Now, to make a long matter short, the Company said to the men: "You will accept
nýothing from us; no evidence will convince
you; we are ready to accept judgment, and
the judge will be nained by one of three
courts that you may choose yourself, but by
that judgment this time you shall be bound
and we will bo bound-we agree in advance."
What £lid the men say? "We shall not ho

Minister of Nova Scotia went to the men and
said: "I arn going to institute an ioquiry,
an investigation, and that investigation will
pass judgment, and by that both parties will
be bound." What did the Company say?
The Company saýid: "Yes, we shail ho

good judgment come back to those workmen.
And now let us soe who is right or wrong?

is: How -much can the Company pay? Hlow

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I do not know,
but it is quite evident that a company is in
business to make profits, and for that purpose
it must do business. It is obvious that when
it is not doing business it must be prevented
by a very serious cause.

I am trying to show

my honourable friend what is the cause.
Knowing what the trouble is, perhaps he will
come to my conclusion, that there is no use
in applying a little liniment on a cancerous
ulcer, even if it is applied by a kindly hand.
It will not effect a cure.
Now let us consider what these miners get.
Let us take them by the hand and lead them
away from these dark pits where they are
so badly treated. Let us take the skilled
men in the mines of Nova Scotia, who earn
$7 a day, and see what they could earn elsewhere. I am consulting the official document.
"Wages and Hours of Labour in Canada,"
published in 1925. In Nova Scotia those men
might be carpenters. Carpenters earn $4.56
a day. Painters get $5.28 a day; plumbers,
$4.80 a day; stonecutters, $5.90 a day; electrical workers, $4.80 a day. There are only
two trades, the bricklayers and the plasterers,
that earn as high as $7.30 a day-only two
callings where these men could get their
average wage; for they earn from $6 up to
$12 and $15 a day.
As to the labourers, what do you think they
earn? Do not forget that the men in and
about the mines earn $3.50 and more a day.
What do labourers in Nova Scotia earn? A
wage of $2.80 a day.
Now let us see what they could earn in
other mining enterprises in Nova Scotia, in
the mining of metal-coal, silver and nickel.
I am hurrying through the statistics of wages,
as I see them; I am omitting none. This
is how the present wages read: $2.50, $3, $3,
$2, $3. 83, $3. $3, $3, $3, $3.50. $2, $2.25, $4,
$3, $3.50, $2.50, $3, $3.50, $2.50 $2.50, $2.50.
$2.50, 82.50. That is hardly half of what
these men are getting at the present time.
But I think I can give my honourable
friend a rather convincing argument. I have
always had the greatest respect for the Union
of which he is a member. Indeed no union
in the land has been able to obtain for itself
fatter wages. But I must say that, comparing the wages of the railway men with those
of the miners, I am rather surprised. Let us
see what the railway men earn-and my honourable friend may perhaps take a leaf out
of this book to defend his Union sorne day
on the floor of this House. Take the conductors. I have heard my honourable friend
tell of the responsibility involved in being a
conductor, and I quite understand it. The
lives of hundreds of people depend on the
Hon.

Mr. BEAUBIEN.

conductor. He is the trusted servant of the
Company. He is the man who receives the
fares. He is practically the captain of the
ship; therefore he must be a man of
excellent qualifications. What does he get?
The wage for a passenger conductor is $4.27
a day. The freight conductor receives $5.80
a day. The brakeman gets $2.93 a day, the
baggageman $3.04 a day, the engineer $6, the
fireman $4.48, and so on. I have some misgivings as to these figures, because I understand that they are applied at the rate of
time and a half for overtime, which makes a
difference.
But, honoura'ble gentlemen, is it not fair
to contend that the men at the mines receive
very substantial wages? All those who are
tender-hearted are interested in their present
misery. No doubt, in certain homes it must
be very real. But is it not, after all, a fact
that nowhere in the land, from ocean to ocean,
if you were to knock at every door, could
you obtain for these men the equivalent of
what they get in the way of wages, in view
of their occupation and their qualifications.
That is the situation.
Now, honourable gentlemen, what is the
rencdy? Before I pass on to that sulbject
will you bear with me while I deal with two
figures? Remember that these men are paid
a shade under the 1921 wages. How does the
cost of living to-day compare with that of
1921? In 1921 the index figure was 190. What
is it to-day? It is 152. Are the men suffering, or are they better off now than they were
in 1921? In 1921 they had practi.cally the
same wages, but the cost of living was 50 per
cent greater.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: But they had employment.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I will come to that
in a moment. At present the cost of living :is
down practically 50 per cent and they have
the same wages.
Now we corne to the real cause of the
trouble. "Give ,them work," says my honourable frientd. Well, I shall attempt to find a
way to give them work. Lt is admitted by
everybody that when the United Mine Workers of Amnerica invaded this country, trouble
entered with them; not only trouble, but, notwithstanding what my honourable friend has
said, repudiation of contracts. They have done
that at different times. I have cited two instances where vailuable properties were abandoned to ruin, in violation of olauses of contracts that could. not be clearer or more binding. What have they done in the Maritime
Provinces? This is, in my opinion, one of the
most dangerous symptoms of the whole disease

taken control of an honest, sober, intelligent

as you find to-day, that cannot see where its
ownbread and butter lie. Do you know how
they do it? I will. tell you. McLjachlan was
arrested in 1923 for seditiious language. There
was no limit to bis violent utterances. He was
sentenced to two years' imprisonment. A few
months afterwards be was set at liberty. Wht
was the mysterious, shady influence that
secured bis liberation, I Sanot tell, but I
suspect. McLachian lias continued bis work.
He is now the editor of the Maritime Labour
Herald. Do you want a sample of what this
paper sayýs? Just Jisten:

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My honourable
friend, I amn sure, does not desire to have the
House rnisunderstand the flacts. I arn sure
he is aware of the fact that the United Mine
Workers' organization, to which he has made
reference, bas noth-ing whatever to do with
such propaganda as fie has just read, and that
it emanates solely from the Communist Party
as it exists in this country. The stable labour
organizations in Canada, backed by the hundreds of thousands of sensible Canadian citizens who ax~e engaged in earning their livélihood by a monthly or daily wage, do not
subseribe to any such views as aTe expressed
in the words tihat my honourable friend bas
just read, and it would be entirely wrosig to
confuse those sentiments with the politicies
of organized labour in this country.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: My honourable
friend makes a distinction that I cannot very
well see. In Sydney, Nova Seotia, there la a
branch of the U.M.W., is there not?
Hon. Mr. MeCORMICK: Would the honourable gentleman permit me?

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: If the honourable
gentleman wishes.
Hon. ýMr. MoCORMICK: Without -entering into the discussion of the matter of
difference between the Company and the men,
I think it is proper to give an explanation. of
that, because otherwise a wrong impression
may be created in this House and in the
country.
Let it be understood firat, with regard to the
repudiation of contracte, that these repudiation were made under the regime of this man
MeLachlan. He bas since hecome ineligible
for office in the UM.W. Furthermore, the
United Mine Workers of America, as long as
they have been known in Nova Seotia-and
before that time I paid no attention to themhave always stood by the agreements that
their officers make with organizations operating in Canada, and they are standing by. such
agreements to-day.

SENATE
It is only fair to state also that this McLachlan and the paper that he edits down
there are in no way representative of the
workingnen of Nova Scotia. If you want
any further evidence of that, it is afforded in
this fact. It was while MüLachlan and his
friends were in the leadership of the workmen's union in Cape Breton, that the disorders took place in Sydney and at the mines,
when the stores were broken into and depredations were committed around the steel
works. These things were not at all in accord
with the feelings or disposition of the great
body of workmen there, and to-day they have
a new set of men. There are grounds for
different views with regard to unreasonable
opinions on the part of the men, or on the
part of the employers. With that question

I will not deal, but I would like to point out
this other aspect. It may be said that during the strike there, or during the conditions

that obtained as a result of it, the company
was justified in closing its stores. The case
was aggravated by the closing of the Company's

stores.

It

was

customary-I

think

even the Company itself made the statement
recently, and I think it is quite correct-for
about half the men employed by the British
Empire Steel Company to be supplied from
stores of the Company.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Order.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Will my honourable friend excuse me?

admit that.
But notwithstanding all that,

passes resolutions such

Of course, the men were

carried away by men who are really Bolshevists in their souls. It is not my contention
that every man in that union is possessed of
these ideas, but unhappily it is too true that

these men who are good honest men are
swayed and held by terror of these other
men. Everybody knows now that they are

holding meetings and that no man dares rise
and say: "I want work: I don't want doles
or charity." No man dares get up-and why?
Because these Reds have methods of keeping

them silent: if it is not by overpowering them
or entreating them, it is by calling them
scabs, and, because they are good men, attacking them through their sensitive souls.
Perhaps you think that what I say is an
my honourable friend may
exaggeration;
think that perhaps I am partial, that all that
trouble might exist without the United Mine
Workers and Mr. Lewis, of Indianapolis, who,
as a general. orders his men to resist the advance of ordinary times and normality.
May I cite another example just as bad?
What has happened in British Columbia where
the miners stood out for months and exacted
from the companies wages that the industry
could not pay because coal in the United
States is not produced altogether by union
men? In West Virginia 80 per cent of it is
produced by men who broke away from the
union because they preferred working every
day to working for only a month. Mr. Lewis
cannot hold his men, but he holds them as
long as he can. He knows that if the front
is pierced anywhere there will be a retreat
all over. And what would become of the
general if the troops retreated on all the
fronts? Therefore the watchword is "no reduction of wages whatever may happen."
After months and months the men in British
Columbia went to the proprietors of the mines
and said, "We must have work." The operators
opened up their books just as did the British
Empire Steel Company, and said, "Gentlemen, look here. See the cost of coal; look
at the cost at which it may be laid down from
the United States in competition with your
own product." The men said, "Well, you are
right; but we cannot reduce wages unless we
break away from the United Mine Workers."
That was the conclusion. The operators said:

"It is for you to decide.

We cannot do any-

thing." And what happened? The men broke
away from the United Mine Workers, and

now they are all working and all earning, and

MAY 5, 1925

Fernie is now as prosperous and happy as it
was before; but the United Mine Works have
been sent back home to the United States to
their chief, Mr. Lewis.
Do not think that I exaggerate. Let me
now read an article which was published by
the Montreal Star on the 18th of March. It
says:

There is suffering and distress in the Cape Breton
ceai fields and the women and children there are
carrying an unmerited load of heaviness and misery.
This is a natural corollary of industrial strike. It
is part of the price which the strikers must pay for
the use of tbis dearly bought weapon. It is an
element of cost which those responsible for the strike
always figure on when they rail the tune.
The Gentlemen from Indianapolis, who have had
many years of experience in bitter and intensive wartare, must have known that there would be hunger
and suffering in hundreds of homes when there was
no wage envelope te draw frm the Company at the
end of the week. They must have known that with
credit stopped at the stores and "'the man" idle in
the house assistance would have to be given te purchase the necessaries of life.
These Gentlemen from Indianapolis, with their long
experience and their supremely efficient organization,
cannot have embarked upon this struggle without
counting the cost and making provision for the relief
of the conditions which they knew must follow, as the
night the day. To believe that they rushed in heedlessly is te charge them with a callousness which
would be inhumanly brutal or to saddle them with
a deadening incapacity to which their past record
gives the lie.
Of course these Gentlemen fromn Indianapolis say
that there is no strike; that the British Empire Steel
Company bas locked out its employees. It is in poor
taste te introduce such a jest inte the climax of a
tragedy. Nobody who is net blinded by partisanship,
and least of all these able and industrious organizers
frem the South, really imagines that the Company
bas locked out the men.
The British Empire Steel Company would net boit
and bar the front gates and lock out their employees
at the very time when, after months of implorings
and appeal they bad received word from the Canadian
National Company of large orders for steel rails to
lie rolled at mills which will need hundreds of tons
of coal in the process.
The Company did not turn the key in the lock of the
front gate on the maintenance men at the risk of sndangering their properties to the extent of hundreds
of thousands of dollars.
Surely the Company would net order a lockout on
the same day they had agreed te keep the mines working until an impartial commission liad investigated the
wage problem-a scheme te which the United Mine
Workers of America would net give their consent.
This flimsy excuse of the lock-out is the cruel jest
of the men who called the strike-the Gentlemen from
Indianapolis.

z01

in Germany was generally conceded te be the principal
cause of the failure of Britain to meet these prices.
But what sort of an outcry would there have been in
Britain if the wage schedules had been fixed by an
Internationale dominated by Germany and if German
officials had ealled a strike because, as organizers, they
were not satisfied with the existing scale. Canada
cannot forever have the wages of one of her basic industries settled by the Gentlemen from Indianapolis.
Apart from the wage scale, is there net soma antipathy from secret and mysterious sources against this
company financed largely by British money. Dos the
British Empire Steel Company have an irritating sound
te certain foreign interests. Is it possible that those
who have failed te absorb it may in their annoyance
seek te destroy it?
*
*
*
Having called the tune, the Gentlemen from Indianapolis will now pay the piper. Telegraph despatches
say that there is actual want and suffering at Sydney.
The delay in having funds transmitted from the capacious bank accouIt of the United Mine Workers of
America te Sydney is inexplicable. If there is suffering
and want, why the inexcusable delay on the part of
the foreign organizers?
What say the Gentlemen from Indianapolis?

I have in my hand an article from the
Montreal Gazette of April 23, which is as
follows:

The war caused the expenditure of billions of
borrowed money, of which the workers got a large
share. Wages were advanced to unprecedented figures
and too often spent as they were received. The
prices of everything advanced, and in some cases
continued te advance after the war. The heavy taxes
levied on business enterprises made the situation
worse. If they did net hasten the depression they
tended to delay recovery. Many industries felt the
effects. Published reports of commercial and industrial
corporations show that, in Canada as in other countries, in case after case, operations have been carried

capital was at stake accepted the situation and kept
their establishments open in the knowledge gained
from past experience that a restoration of better
conditions was only a matter of time and that revived
trade would enable themn te recover their losses.
The workers as a class got the chief benefit of such
a policy. In some cases there were reductions of
wages which enabled operations te be carried on and
helped te lessen the effect of the depression. In
other cases strong trades unions were able, by strikes
or threats of strikes and the tying up of great
industries, te hold wages at the high war-time figures
and even te increase them. The case of the Nova

industry and business are again on a sound and
progressive basis. The situation is not peculiar to
Canada. The coal trade in Britain is depressed, and
the results are being felt by the transportation interests. The London and Northeastern Railway is
putting economies into force and reducing its staffs.
The Great Western Railway is doing the same thing,
and proposes to suspend the 48-hour week for its
employees, the establishment of which cost the unions
grest sums of money. The railways cannot maintain
their rates of outlay from the traffic they get to
carry, and some of them, like the local colliery owners,
are not earning dividends. Such an order cannot be
long maintained in any industry.

The matter is plain, honourable gentlemen.
Any man who understands the situation, is
not biased, and bas not what I would call a
professional mentality, sees clearly where the
trouble is. Do you think, honourable gentlemen, if the company had lied when it gave the
cost of producing coal, that it would have
offered four times te submit its books te any
judge, and submit te be bound in advance by
the judgment? No. The men who direct
that company would not be se stupid or se
reckless. On the other hand, honourable gentlemen, do you think the gentlemen from
Indianapolis, as they are called, and the
leaders of the men, who are clever and can
read the assets and liabilities and cost of
production of the Company-for if you look
at their bankbook you will find that they
handle millions every year-would not have
called the tune, and said: "Yes, we have
got you at last; we have you nailed now; we
are going to throw the lie in your teeth?"
But have they done that? Not at all; there is
no tribunal on earth that is lofty enough
for these men; they are a law unto themselves.
If there is a permane'nt cure, honourable gentlemen, it is in keeping away this contamination from across the line which is poisoning our
population. Why, a poor devil who comes here
from Central America is 'looked over te find
out whether he has an eye disease because
of possible contamination, or, forsooth, if he
is poor, as he may be a charge on our hands.
If there is anything wrong with him he is
returned promptly. But an organized army
with millions at its back cemes here and
destroys our industry and poisons the minds
of our workmen, keeps them idle for months
and spreads misery everywhere, and nothing
is done te keep it away from this country.
Perhaps it would be good advice to say te
the Government of Nova Scotia through my
honourable friend, (Hon. Mr. Robertson) that
it is time we protected ourselves. Forget this
company, if you like; forget, if you like, the
mines of British Columbia. forget yesterday
and to-day, if you like, but think of to-morrow.
What are you going te do te protect us? Do
Hon.

Mr. BEAUBIEN.

you only protect us against individuals who are
poor, who drift in one by one, and who are
practically harmless compared with these organizations? Is it not time that we had protection, real protection, against people of that
stamp, because if they are able, as they have
been in the past, te pervert a population as
sound and honest as that of the country of my
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. McCormick)
there is no hope for us anywhere else. My
advice to the Government is to give us that
protection. and when men like McLachlan have
been judged and condemned and sentenced
to two years, at least to abstain from liberating them after three months. It is a very
bad example, and the trouble that exists ail
over the Maritime Provinces is evidence of
that.
Hon. JOHN S. McLENNAN: I am net
connected with the mining company nor with
the men who are out of work. The question
whether there should or should not be a reduction of wages is a complex one. There
is much evidence on the one side and the
other. From what I am told by people net
connected with the British Empire Company,
but familiar with the coal trade, my impression is that it is extremely difficult for Cape
Breton te regain the markets in the St.
Lawrence which it has lost.
Twenty years ago Cape Breton companies
shipped into the St. Lawrence every ton they
lad any right. They were successful competitors with coal froi the United States and
Great Britain. Cape Breton occupied a proud
position, to which it had been brought after
20 years, until Cape Breton coal stood on a
full parity with old country or American coal.
That position gradually declined, and American coal, and to sone extent old country
coal, came in. The war dislocated tonnage,
and made it impossible for the coal company te get vessels te carry its coal, and
disturbed conditions of every kind, and we
had te yield the St. Lawrence very largely te
American coal. The consequence was that the
quantities of coal produced in Cape Breton
after a certain time decreased. The United
States has mines which could supply probably
two or three times the amount of coal for
which there ds any market. One has noticed
that mines are closing in Great Britain. There
one has seen colliery proprietors offering the
mine te their men in order te keep it going as
a business industry, the men te run it without
cost te the proprietor. A still more extraordinary thing took place in one of the smaller
Welsh mines, where the colliers got together
a certain amount of money and offered it te
the management te keep it for another six

MAY 5,19lm
months, as a guarantee against doss. Such is
the condition of the coal tradie, flot only in
Cape Breton but the world over.
-Negotiations have gone on ince Iast Decemnber for the adjustment of the Nova Scotia
dispute, but those negotiations have thua far
failed. I think it only fair to say, however,
that except a little time ago, when there
seerned to me and other people some delay
on the part of Mr. Armstrong, Premier Armstrong-with whom, as you possibly know,
I have no political affiliation&--has acted admirably and with great determînation and
patience.
I think mistakes have been made on both
aides. 1 think the men have been ill-advised.
But I wish to note a declining tide of ili-feeling and suspicion againat the Company, and I
would not attribute to the United Mine
Workers of America sinister effeots attributed
to District No. 26 under the influence of this
man ýMcLachIan. I cordiwlly agree with the
last speaker that it is a pity that McLachlan
was let out of prison, for since that time he
has seemed recaloitrant.
Yet within the last year advances have
been made. I feel convinced that there is a
better feeling, although it does flot always
appear on the surface. I have been in Cape
Breton within the Iast. three weeks, and I arn
înformed, and also gathered fromn observation,
that the unfortunate conditions are accompanied by leas bitterness than. bas been the
cae when similar conditions have prevailed
so often, and, which have been of so great
disadvantage both to the conpany and the
men. I arn also advised that the Maritime
Labour Herald is declining in circulation; in
fact, when I left Sydney -on SuÛday night I
heard that the issue of Saturday was the last
number of that paper. Much as I arn mterested in Sydney, one feels that what the
Labour Herald says is of no very great consequence, or whether it continues te exiat.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I woulL like ta say
that there is an explanation why the Labour
Herald is discontinuing publication. I have
no use for what it says, but there is a reason.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: 1 understood it
wus not. being read by the miners.
Hon. MT. ROBERTSON: The reason is
that the plant waa buxned laut week.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: My honourable
friend did flot know how hot it was.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN:
I assure my
henoui-able friend that the plant had net been
burned on the day .1 left. That was the latest
knowledge I had. Nobody is attributing that
te, the Besco?

207

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No, flot at, all.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: I understood it
was declining because it had ne circulation
among the people, and I arn sure that ail
who spoke, and ail who know the minera ef
Cape Breton, agree that they are right-thinking men on the whole; they are decen-t men,
and with their intelligence I helieve the coinpany will yet be able to make great progrea.,
and we' have been hoping for that result. I
noticed a heading on a paper which one of
my colleagues had before us here; the next
day after the news of the break-down of the
Halifax conference one of the papers spoke
of t.he desire and hope that it would be
at once reinstated, and that the work of
reconciliation would be kept on until it was
successful.
On motion of Hon. Mr. MeCormick, the
'debate was adjourned until to-rnorrow.

REPRESENTATION IN THE HOUSE 0F
COMMONS
MOTION

Hon.
moved:

GEORGE

LYNCH-STAUNTON

That in the opinion of the Sonate an humble addreas
should be presented to Ris Majesty, praying that the
British North America Act be amended so as to
reduce the representation in the House of Gommons, to
the endi that the whole representation in that House
1)0 siibstantially decreased.

He said: I intend, honourable gentlemen,
to consider this question froni two points of
view: first, the usefulness of the bouse of
Commons, and, secondly, its cost.
I hope, honourable gentlemen, you wiil not
be unduiy alarmed if 1 begin with William
In the early years of
the Conqueror.
English parhiamentary histary the King ahane
governed the country, and to this day our
Acts of Parliament open with the statement
that "His Ma.iesty, by and with the advice
of the Senate and buse of Gommons of
Canada. enacts as follows." William did not
allow the feudal barons to govern him. He
iiid flot allow principalities and dukedonis to
rise up and divide England, as they did over
the continent, but he subordinated ail the
barons and ail the people to goverfnent by
himself in his council.
This method continued in full force until
after the tume of the Tudor monarchs. True.
about the tume of Edward I the King sent
out his writ to those whom. he desired to
forni the House of Lords, to attend on bum;
and to the sheriffs of the different counties
he sent a writ to summon knights to appear
for the purpose of consenting to the legislation of the council of the renîni. Alter
some tume the King, knowing that these
knights were merely lis tools, consented to
allow them., some share in the imposition of
taxes on the people. The memibers of Pariament were not, until the Reforni Act of 1832,
in any sense the representatives of the people
of England. In the early days it was the
King's tenants who elected the knights or the
members of Parliament; and when that
systeni passed away, the representatives who
appeared in Parliament came from the rotten
boroughs, or froni cities like Plymouth, with
70.000 people, sent by less than 500 electors.
Therefore no person can say that old House
of Comnions as constituted. in Enghanid ever
was a representative body. The King was ailpowerful, even down ta the tume of the
Georges. The members of Parliament did
nothiýng but consent to the legisation. They
took no part in the law-making. That was
done, as iA is now, by the Government, and
consented to by members of Parliament.

When the Parliamentary Reformi Bill was
introduced the people were permaitted to vote
for members of Parliament. First the franchise was given to a large class, those who
were freehoiders to the extent of 40 shillings.
EventualIy every Tom, Dick, and Harry in
the Kingdom. was given the vote.
When we hecamne confederated into the
Dominion of Canada our parliamentary institutions were based on those which had
been in existence since the time of the Parlîamentary Reforni in England, and our Parliamentary system is exactly the sanie to-day
as it was 56 years ago, when it was created.
What is that Parliamentary system? It is
the fashion to talk about the people's representatives legislating for the country, and
about "the voice of the people, the voice of
God." being heard in the House of Commons.
.and it is said that the (people mIle this country
through their mepresentatîves. That is not, the
case. In the old days the King was the ruler
of the Empire. At this day the Prime Minister is the ruler of Canada.
Now let us see what that means. How are
memJbers of Parliament elected-in fact, not
in theory-or, if you like, in fact and in
theory? First, the electorate is divided into
two. three or four parties, and when a general
election cornes on the leaders of these parties
]av down a platform, which they submit to
the electors. The Government candidates go
before the people and promise that à~ they
are elected they wili support the poiicy of
the Government; the Opposition candidates
go before the people and promise that they
wiil support the Opposition leader; and the
people eleet theni to go to Parliament and
support the Opposition or the Government:
they do not elect theni to go there to legisiate
for the people. The majority of the people
have committed the government of the country
to the Government, and they send those representatives there to support that Government. Minorities of people send their Tepresentatives to support the Opposition, and
for no othier purpose.
The other day 1 heard the leader of the
Opposition in the House of Commons say,
when the Government proposed to send the
Shipping Bill to a Committee, Vhat the Government was departing entirely from parliamnentary practice--that the legisiation originated with the Groverniment, and it was the
Government's duty to submit it to the House
of Commons, and inforni the House that it
took the responsibility for the legisiation, and
would stand or falil by it. He said, in effect,
that there was no precedent or excuse for
sending any Government Bill to a committee,
because the members of the House of Coni-

REVISED EDITION

210

SENATE

mions were only there for the purpose of
approving or rejecting, .iust as His Majesty's
representatives appreves or rejects an Act
wbich is brought up to him after its final
passage through Parliament. And the bonýourable gentleman was quite rigt-if 1 may
say se, speaking of him-that it is the unbroken practice of ýGovernments flot to consuit the House of Commons, but to submit
their legýsation to, themn for approbation,
with the intimation that if they refuse to
approve it, the Government may treat that
refusa] us a vote of want of confidence and
resign or dissolve the bouse. That is the
position which the Government takes in al
ceuntries that have British institutions, and
that is the position wbich the people expect
it to take. So the members are sent there
simply te approve or disapprove of the action
of the Government.
The Prime Minister is the leader of one
party before bie is called on to form a Ministry.
When ealled upen by His Excellency hie
chooses his subordinates, and hie alone communicates with the head of the state, and hie
is entitled to have the resignations of thýose
gentlemen tendered to him wbhenever hie asks
for tbem. I haive heard it said that one distinguisbied Prime Minister held in blank the
resignation of every Minister on bis appointment. At the Council Board the Premier dictates to the 'Council wbat the legisiation shall
be, and the Council then presents that legislation to the bouse of Commons.
The other day we saw in the House of Comnnions that, wben the meinbers became
unruly,'
and undulv protract-ed the debate, the Prime
Minister said that the Government would nýot
tolerate such oonduet, that the people of thîs
country expected a strong Government with
strong support. and that if the members of
the Commons did not behave tbemselves bie
would dissolve the House. This brought them
to their senses very quickly. and things went
s;mocthly after that. That is only an example
cf the exact position of a memfber of the
House of Commons; hie is not independent;
hie bas nio auîthority; hie is simply a follower,
to do wbat hie is bid. The bouse of Gemfmons never pretends to reflect public opinion.
There neyer bas been, in the bistory of
Canada, a Parliament that voted want of
confidence in the Ministry. The House of
Commons came mighty near doing so once
when, for a consideration, some of Sic John
Macdonald*s supporters crossed the floor in
1873, and if Sir John bad not resigned there
might bave been a vote o.f want of confidence.
But we have seen Government after Government go down to defeat at the polls-bowing
that it bad not the confidence of the people;
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON.

that its legisiation and its actions did not
meet with the approval of the Canadian
public. But, excepting on one occasion. we
have neyer had a House of Commons te vote
against an unpopular Govemnment. The members have never, on coming into Parliament,
expressed the opinions of the people: they
bave always recognized their position te be
that of simply followers of their party chiefs.
AIl the benefit wbich we derive fromn the
House of Gommnons we could obtain if it were
in the position of the Electoiral Gollege of
the United States. Wben the Amecican people
choose a President, tbe two or three or four
candidates lay before the-m a platform, and
hie wbose platform is most pleasing te tbe
electorate becomes President. of the United
States, and thereafter governs that country,
s0 far as the exectitive office is concerned. If
we desiried to obtain a knowledge cf what tbe
people t.beught, why net have the members
of the House of Commrons constituted as the
Electoral Cellege, and come te Ottawa, or
send word te Ottawa. as is in fact done at
Washington. that tbey approve of Mr. Mackenzie King or of MT. Arthur Meighen,
and tbereafter Mr. Meigben or Mc. King
would do as is done ncw-gcvern this country
until the next election.
MÎy contention is
that the unweildy Hcu.e of Commons is net
required or indeed cf sny value under our
formn of government, which is based on gevernment by the Prime Minister and bis Cabinet. Parliament is net a Roman curia, a
legislativc body, or an rxecutive body: it is
simply an endorser cf the Govecemient.
Now, let us look at the question fromn tbe
point cf view of cost. I know that economy
leaves politicians cold; I kncw that public
men of Canada do net think that te
ý
economnical is popular or attractive. 1 know
that oee is laughed at wben bie talks cf
saving a million, five million, ten million
dellars; but I remember that Mr. Gladstene
once said that a public man who clespised
a shilling wvas not fit te be Chancelier cf
England.
Notwithstanding that one's voice
falîs on deaf ears, it is ene's duty, when iii
a position te do se, as we are, te draw attention frorm time te time te the unreasonable cost cf gevernment in this country.
Tbe nine million Canadians have a Dominion Parliament with 235 rnembers, and
growing ail the time. 1 believe that at the
next election we are gcing te, enjoy 250. We
bave 16 or 17 Ministers drawing salaries
which are princely te most cf them. A general election ccsts us over $2,000,000. O6ur

except in one case; but I arn told that in
British Columbia it costs the tidy surn of
816,000,000 to govern 500,000 people. Alberta

and in my own mind I foreteil what
will corne by what has came.
We know
that in a 'hundred years our populatioL has flot retained its natural increase.
We know that its debt is enormous, and that
it is increasing by a hundred million a year.
We knaw that we are committed to take part
in every war in which the Empire may liecorne involved. Even in the suppression of
a rebellion in South Africa we took part,
and lately we were asked whether we would
hel.p in a fight against the Turks. We have
had some taste of what war really costs. It
is not only the giant increase in the railway
delit which we have to face, but, in view of
the la-et that there have been in barbaric
Europe three, four, five wars every hundred
vears, we know that in ail proliability twenty
or thirty years will flot paas liy before we
shall be en.-aged «gain, at a cost flot only
of blood, but of many hundreds of millions
of dollars.
I do not think we should expeet
our Itax-bearers to jinicrease ýmore mpidtly in the
future than in the past, and arn therefore
uneasy about aur present and future delit.
How on earth are we going ta pay-how on
earth is this people going to survive, if we
continue ta despise the shilling? 1 say that it

we are in a difficult country, small as our
resources are, te walk circumspectly; but,
instead of that, with bannera flying and music

No man can show a way

Canada ever ta pay her debt.
I observe that Mr. Lapointe told us the

Austraha was in a worse piekIe than we were,
and that South Africa had more debts than
we.

shauld be represented by districts, and not,
as now, by local centres of population, because
it is most desirable that, the Government
should have men fromn every part of the country, if they have any, ta advise them. There is
no advantage in having 15 or 20 members

there is any advantage in having advisers at

RURAL CREDITS
DISCUSSION AND INQUIRY

The Senate rcsumned from April 23 the
adjourned debate on the :motion of Hon. Mr.
Willoughby:
That he will cail the attention of the Senate to tise
masser of Rural Credits, and wiIl inquire if it is tIse
intention of tihe Goveresment to introduce any legislation durissg the present Session in relation thereto.

Hon. EDWARD MICHENER:
Honourable gentlemen, the sub.ject of this inquiry
may not be of sucb treinendous imiportance
as constitutional qtuestions or national or
international questions svhicb we have discussed -in the last few days. It is, however,
of immediate urgenev to somýe parts of
Canada.
The honouraible momber from Moose Jaw
(Hon. Mr. Willoughby), 'who introduced the
sub.iect, spoke from the viewpoint and needs
of the Province of Saskatchewan. I wish to
express the view of the twin-sister Province
of Alberta.
Theso twvo Provinces have
possibly greater interest in this question 'than
other parts of Canada. However, bonourable
gentlemen, I believe the question has a wider
,application than sirnply 1hat of local needs.
It is a question of financing the foundational
industry of thjs country'.
Almost every progressive couîntry tbroughouît the 'world hýas devised and adopted some
system of financing a'gric-ulture
for the
develop.ment of production on t'he land, other
than tIse commercial systems in vogule..
Agriculture, like other industries, has been
undergosng many chaneges in the ýmeîthods of
operation during the jpast quarter of a ýcentury.
Farm lab~our is roplaced, largely by machinery.
The farmer to-dav is a mechanical operator
rather than a labouîrer. Farming is done by
different methods now from those formerly
empl.oyed, and these newer methods require
greater expen.dliture and more capital. So far
in Canada there bas heen, apparently, no
serins attempt on the part of the Governnment to devise a system of financing suited to
the neeris of far-mers. The prcsent commercial bancing system of short terra credits is mot
of very mucb tise to the man on the land.
While farming is a profitable industry, it is
rot profitable in 'the way of quick returns, as
are other industries. The fanmer needs to
wait a year, possibly two or three years. for
bic profits, and, these to a great extent are ne-

presented by ýincrease of land, stock and equipment. and not alwavs by very much ready
cash.
No new country can successfully develop
without capital. We have in Canada to-day
enormotîs areas of perhaps the most fertile
land iný the wopld. AIl it. needs is the touch of
capfital and labour to bring almoest unthinkaible
prodtuction, andi wealth to this great Dominion;
but. until the Govennment of the day undertsskes in earnest to sipply siome better system
of flnanéng and encouragement to our agricîs1îtîr91 areas, we cannot hiope to secure the
full fru:;tion of osîn possibilities along these
huecs. For t.his: reason I shaîl take yotîr time
for a few inutes to shiow the local needs of
somp sy-terrn of agnictîltral cned.it. as well as
the general n-eeds of a betten financial system
for the encouragement of agriculture.
The honourable member fnoma Moose, Jaw
(Hon. Mr. Willotughby) spoke of different
systemas in vogue in various parts of the world.
In Genmany they bave intensive cultivation
of the land. with a 'banking systeni that is
operated entirely in the interest of the borrowený,.
Consequently money can be secured
at the very lowesî possible rate o.f interest,
and upon veny lonýg terms. Thus a iman who
secures the capital to develop bis land by
the amortization plan of a boan on an annual
repaymnent of intenest and principal. which
is equated oven a tenm of yessns. pays no more
t'han the ordinary interest reqtîired by boan
companies.
In France I ttnderstand theno is a modified
systemn under the Credit Foncier Company.
1 arn not so familiar with the working of
that systeni, but I believe that it encourages
production.
The United States offers perbaps the most
outstanding example of a, new systeni of
financing and encouragin-g agricultuîre, difl'ering froni the systen formerly and now in
force for commercial enterprises. They -have
a Farn Loan Board, who operate tbrough
district Fedenal banks, and supply the needs
of people on the land, supplying the money
for a tern of vears on an amortization- plan
at the smallest rate of interest at Which money
can ha secured, :plus the cost of operation of
the system.
In seven different Provinces of Canada we
have legislation pnoviding for some system of
agricultural credits, but thene bas been actual
operation in only ýone or two of theni, principally 'because the provinces have not heen
able to secure a favounable rate of interest
on a suni sufficientlv large to puît the legislation in force. Consequently. in tbose Provinces where the need is gIreatest, Alberta
and Saskatchewan, the sYsteni is not operative

at all. In Alberta, of which I speak especially, there is no capital available for the
settler.
New Zealand, Australia, and the Union of
South Africa have agricultural eredits whereby the settier can get very favaurable loans
on good terms and low rates of interest;
and they have also other settiement sehemnes
by which a thrifty and honest man can take
up land and without very ýmuch capital can
hope for success for hirnself and family.
In Canada we 'have no such encouragement
ta offer ta settlers. In Alberta the loan companies have practically ail withdrawn, partly
because of lasses they suffered by reasan of
failure;ý of crops, and the depression which
followed the war, and possibly partly by the
legi.slation which Alberta bas upon ber Statute
Book, wbereby a number of prior claims con0f course, that
stitute a first martgage.
Province îs responsible for that condition, and
we ýhould not necessarily look for relief to the
Dominion Government beeause of that; yet
those things prevent the boan companies from
lending maney. Then the banks, which loaned
freely a few yearis aga, have necessarily become
collective agencies in that Province, with the
result that there is fia money available in

or partial failure of crops, what is he ta do?
During the war, partly 'for patriotic reasans,
the farmer increased his land and machinery in
order ta speed up production, with the resubt
that to-day many farmers who were pianeers
in that Province find themselves in a very
ernhbarrass-ing position. They may awe money
ta the machine company an which they are
paying possibly one per cent a month; they
may possibly owe store accounts, and perhaps
have a rnartgage an their farm on which they

farmer finds it impassible ta tide over,
especially if his crop fails. There is nowhere
he can look.
Until recently the merchants
tîded over very many settlers in that province; but the credit of the merchant has been
exhausteci; ýconsequent&y huie business is run
practically upon a cash basis. The result is
that, however much wealth the farmer may
have in land and implements and equipment,
he is utterby helpless, hie has nowhere ta look,
because the more he needs beoause of crop
failure in one year, the less likely hie is ta get
assistance from the banks, an advance ta him
fiat being a real banking propositiion. Thus
there is an urgent need, ini that Province for
some method- by which the settler on the band
can tide over ernergencies, and place hîmself
in a position where he and his famiby can
become a permanent asset ta the country. On
account of these conditions many hundreds and

215

thousandsg of settiers have had ta retire and
give up their lands, and I arn sorry ta say that
many have' gone south, where opportunities
seem ta be better.
A system of agricultural credits by which
those settiers could consolidate their debte and
put them upon a better basis, with reasonable
hope of meeting the charge against the land
by reduction of principal and interest, and
ultimately paying off the debt, would, enable
thousands of settiers ta remain upon the land
and become a permanent asset ta Canada.
I ar n ot in favour of making money too easy
for people on the land; but in a new country
it is absolutely necessary that money should
be available for legitimate farming purposes,
and unless it is Sa I do flot see any inimediate
chance for that Province ta progress very
much.
This problem is conneeted also with the
immigration policy of this country. The Government tells us that it wants people ta
settie on the land; that is the class of settlers
it is bidding f or. But what is the use of
impending money ta briing tihose p~eoplIe ta Canada if we have no way by which those with
limited means oan settle on the land and succeed? If the people naw on the land in the
Western Provinces cannot hold their land,
or succeed under present conditions, how can
wc expect new settiers ta corne ta a strange
land, with small capital, and succeed under
these conditions?
Then, we have ta campete with New
Zealand, where they have a land settiement
scheme; and with Australia, which has a
sirnilar scherne. In order that the Government palîcy of immigration should succeed
we need somne systern of financing the Settiers,
otherwise we cannot hope for much suocess
along immigration lines. We ail know that
what Canada needs to-day is population. We
have the maehinery of gavernment, and we
have railroads sufficient for at least twice
the present population; but. in order to get
people ta fill the far-flung areas of fertile land
we must devise some method by which new
settiers can reasonab¶y hope for success.
We hear people to-day say that in Canada
there is fia East and there is fia West, that
we are an united country. There is an East,
and there is a West, geographically and they
are a long way «part, and their problems -are
very different; but with every problem there
is a way of solution, and I believe it is passibyle ta solve the9e, prdiblems of East andl
West in the interest of the Dominion.
But we must be willing ta make mutual cancessions; the East must make concessions ta
the West, and the West must be willing to
meet the East. I have heard some eastern

unfortunate by reason of the exigencies of
nature is absolutely una)ble to go on and tide
bimself over until conditions improve. Itie of
Itbese special cases, I presume, the boaxid
would take first consideration, and the wise
anid buoi'neeslike usee of funds wouil, ýI befieve,
be a great boon and encouragement to settlers,
already in the West, and would also, make it
possible for new settlers to corne in, and
locate successfully and reside on tbe lands of
Western Canada.
It la difficult, no doubt, for honourable members in Eastern Canada te, reahize the conditions to wbicb we are subject in Western
Canada. For that reason it is difficiût,
for saine bonlourable gentlemen
perhai,
to see tbe necessity of pledging tbe credit of
the Dominion for the assistance of tbe fariner,
partiuad4y in Western Canada. Yet I believe, bonourable gentlemen, some sucb
metbod of agricultural credits as that recoinmended by the report of Dr. Tory would be
not only a great encouragement to development in Western Canada, but would redound
to the benefit of the East, and would bring
prosperity to tbe whole of Canada. I trust
that bonourable gentlemen of this House will
give tbis question their favourable consideration, and tbat tbe Leader of the Governinent
in this House will caîl the attention of bis
Govern ment and of the country to the necessity of some systemn of financing agriculture
to the end that agriculture, wbich. is the
foundation of industry of Canada, may be put
upon a 'better 'basis s0 tbat we may reasonably

population and a more rapid development than
we have had in the past few years.
Hon. N. A. BELCOURT: Honourable
gentlemen, this is a subject which a number of
years ago was brougbt to my attention, and to
which, at the time, I gave considerable thougbt.
I think the bonourable member from Moose
Jaw (Hon. Mr. Willougbby) is to be congratulated on bringing the matter to the attention of this House. I look upon it, as I
did in years past, as one of the most important and most prwetical things that this
country ought to do.
The subject is by no means new. It had its
origin immiediately after the, Seven Years War,
when Frederick the Great. found his barons
and seigneurs suffering under very great difficulties because of the tremendous agricultural
depression brought about by the ravages of
the war. The idea, which bas been carried
out since in many countries of Europe, and
which is being applied to-day in the United
States, was in existence under bis regime. He
obliged the large bolders of land in Silesia
to form a sort of combination by whicb
they mortgaged their lands for loans secured,
very mucb in the way which has been folThe success of the plan
lowed since.
was very marked, and immediately the
example was taken up in different coun-tries
in Europe. 'It spread to Norway, Sweden and
France, and tbrougbout -Germany, Italy, and
.so on. As was pointed out, it bad its manifestation in France in the establishment of
Credit Foncier, and in Italy in the Credito
Foxadario, both of which have met with grest
,sucess.
1Just about the time my attention was
brougbt to tbis subjeet, in 1913-perbaps I
shaîl be permitted to m.ake a personal reference-,I bad tbe great advantage of dîscussing the matter witb the late Duke of Argyle,
whose son, the present Duke, b-ad become
interested in a company wbich intended to
carry on tbis work in the Canadian Northwest. 1 had several discussions witb ftiim, and
with -the ipromoter of the company. Just about
that turne Pre.sident Taf t had appointed
a ýcommiÀssion, callile'd the United -States
Commission, for tbe purpose of doing
wbat bas been done recently by Dr. Torygoing tborougbly into tbâs matter on the
ground . Tbese commisaioners were sent to
Europe; tbey went ali over Germany and the
üther eountries wbere this systern of rural
credit in its various forms had. been adopted
and put, into practice. Ambassador Herrick,

was stated a moment ago that in Ontario
there are large farms wbere formerly grain
was grown and which to-day are used simply
for .pasturing purposes. If money can be got
hy the farmer -in the way I have described
for the purpose of intensifying his 1cultivation, surely these lands will flot be given
over to pasturing but will be turned over to
intensive culture, and flot only the West, but
the East is going to benefit.
In the United States, at the commencement
of these Feideraq far.m banks. the Feideral
Government advanced three-quarters of a
million dollars f0 each one of the district
banks. That has ail been paid back long
azo. To-day those banks are absolutely selfsu'pporting. That again iis nobhing new: that
bas been the history of ail this financial farming or rural credits in Europe.
Hon. Mr. GvORDO)N: The 'honourable gentleman rnentioned 30-year bonde and also
mortgages. Arn I to understand that money
is loaned on mortgages for that term?
Honý. Mr. BELCOIJRT: What is done is
this. A mortgage is given for say 30 years,
covering both principal and interest by way
of amortization. The 30 years will enable the
fannei' to pay off the whole of the money
borrowed. With these mortgages the company issues obligations or bonds which are
sold tbrougut the community, and which
find a very ready sale. This scheme bas the
great ad'vantage of getting over the difficulty
which the farmer in every country has had
to ineet. namely that of going to the private
money lender, either a person or a corporation. The monev lender does not want to
]end money for ten, fifteen, twenty or thirty
years. He rnay make a mortgage for five
years, or perhaps for ten, but that is the
utmost. By this pooling of mortgages you
are enabyled 'to issue bonds against the very
best security in the world, ibecause, after ail,
agricuifural security is the safest of security.
You are enabled to issue absolutely flegotiable
documents. These bonds may be made for
three months, or six months, or a year, or
a longer term, and if anybody who has lent
money and has these securities ia his possession gets into difficulties, or is suddenly
called upon to meet obligations, he simply
turns in bis bonds and gets bis money. In
that way you overcome the difflculty which
I mentioned before. of the farmer having no
other means of financing than tihe money lent
him in the ordinary way.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Before the honourable
gentleman drops that point I would like him
to inform us a little further. What is the
unit of a pool? As I understood it, one man

219

alone cannot borrow on a rnortgage, but a
number join together. Is that how it is
done?
Hon. Mr. BELOURT: No. What is done
is, as I said before, that the National Farmers'
Association is formedHon. Mr. R0O68: I understand that.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: And, so far as I
have been able to gather, it is flot necessary
that there should be any stipulated number
of farmers engaging to mortgage their lands,
It is a matter wbich bas a start to-day and
grows. A certain number of farmers may
mortgage their land to-day, but the same
process is going on ail the time and the
number is increasing. The system. they have
over in the United States enables them to
take care of a number of mortgages of that
kind, however few there may be in practice.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: If I were a farmer there
and mortgaged my farm in a pool, and some
of the other farmers failed to meet their
obligations, would there be any responsibility
on me, or any effect on the mortgage on my
f arm?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No. Each boan
stands by itself. It is altogether an individual
loan. There is no joint responsibilîty. Perhaps the word "pool" is not the proper term.
Hon. Mr. ROSiS: That was what was
puzzling me.
Hon. Mr. BELC.OURT: Perhaps I should
not have used that word. Whiat I meant
was that a number of farme-rs get together
for the purpose of forming this National
Farmers' Association. Whether there are ten,
twenty or fil ty, I do not know. They say:
'We sh-ill borrow money in this fashion. We
shall buy so much stock in this Association
which we are forming to-day, and we shall
mortgage our lands, and through the Federal
Board, which sits at Washington, we shal
obtain our money." The Board at Washington issues bonds, or obligations, or debentures
-whatever you like to caîl them-as against
these loans.
Hon. L. D. WEBSTER: Are there any
foreclosures on those loans?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: There would be,
I suppose. Some might not pay.
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: No.
Hon. Mr. BELCOIJRT: In an article which
I read not long ago the percentage was given.
I furget the exact figure, but it was very, very
small.
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: What is the result
in the case of a man who bas mortgaged bis

920

SENATE

farrn in that way and does flot ]ive to the
end of the thirty years and pay off the
mortgage?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is like every
other mortgage or obligation: the legal representatives look after it.
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: Will the legal
representatives or the heirs take over the
repayment of the Joan?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But the Joan is
against the farrn, and they rnust look after
it in sorne way or other; just as, wben my
honourable friend goes, bis legal representatives
wvill attend-perhaps flot so well as lie does,
though-to his obligations.
These loans are
deait witb in just the samne way.
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: Yes, but the heirs
may flot be willing to continue.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Then it is a case
of realizing upon the security.
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: What if the scrt
is flot worth the amount of the Joan?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The security must
be wor-th the amounit of the Joan, because
no Joan is made for more than 50 per cent
of the velue.
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: It may have depreciated beyond the 50 per cent.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: These are ordinary
risks. Honourable gentlemen mnust not think
that this is absolute insurance against everv
possibility that rnay arise. I ar n ft setting
forth my own opinion upon it; I arn citing to
the House what lias been accornplished through
this systern in the different countries of Europe
and wbat is being done to-day in the United
States, and I arn quite satisfied that anynne
who will look over the record will he perfectly
assured that the system is absolutely sound,
and perbaps the soundest method of financing
that exists anywhere in the world.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
gentleman bas flot stated the principal, aim
of the issue of the bonds. It is in order to
have constantly liquid money to releod.
Hon. Mr. BELCOIJRT: Yes. I thought I
made that plain by saving that this seheme
offers the solution of the difficulty which bas
confronted every farmer in the comrnunity
in securing financial assistance, in that it
provides for the issue, as agaiost mortgages,
of securities which are quite liquid and negofiable and rnay be handed frorn one person to
another.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

The treasury is
I think I stated that in the

Landschaften of Gerrnany they utilized their
credit over and over again, as rn.any as
,twenty turfnes. The bonids are issued as against
the mortgages; as ithe rooney -cornes in it is
lent out again, on securities; ais against these
securities new obligations are ilssued; and the
p)roes ýgoes on in tihat way airnost indeflnitely.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: That is, on land?
Hon. Mr. BFLCOURT: Yes, on land.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: A man in the Northwest,
whose faim is rnortgaged, but who lias substantial stock and implernents, rnay want to
borrow rnoney. In Gerrnany this used to be
the practice-and this is what I bcd in mind
with regard to the pool question. If. Say,
lire farmers wanted to borrow rnoney. flot on
land, but on personal property, the five of
tbern formed a pool, borrow'ed a certain
arnount and distributed it arnong tbernseives;
but they were ail hiable.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But there 'sa
channel through wbieb that money niay be
secured, and that is ýthrough thbe ordinary bank.
It wil] advancv money on tise products of the

of

question. My honourable frieod realizes that

MAY 6, 1925
this is a pretty wide silbject andti
hat
in the short time given one cannot possibly cover every point. 1 was trying to give,
as it were, a birdseye view of1the qperation,
in order that honourabie members of the
House might make àt their 'business to reati
the report ma-de last year by Dr. Tory and
the supplementary report, to which the honourable gentleman who has iast spoken has
reiferred. That was my principal objeet in
rising to epeak. Those reports are most iteresting andi wiii, 1 tbink, commenýd themselves to the -attention and ideep, consideration
of every honourable anember of the House.
Credit is to-day availabie for almost every
ýindustry but agriculture. It is easy for any-one engaged in trade, or«business of any kind
to procure money in order to carry on his
Qperatfions. The credit systemn is at the basis
of the whole world's business to-day. If you
do away with cretiit -anti deprive tradte, commerce an.d indu9try of the means of obtajining
linancial assistance, you tiestroy them. Yet
the farmner has niot such facilitieýs. He has
often the best sepunity in the country, but he
has no chance, or but a very limitei chance,
to, -et the moaey which he n.eeds; andi in
order to obtain money he has hati to ýpay as
much as 10 or 12 per cent, anti is doing so
to-day. Ifîilis correct to say that agriculture
is the basic intiustry, the rnost indispensable
of all, il is aîowhere truer than in Canada.
Then. surely, those'facilities which -are affordeti
to every other industry shoulti be provideti for
this basic industry of agriculture. Il we put
agriculture on a proper basis, if we give the
fariner the copportunity of doing the beat he
can with bis landi, we at once seZ the resuit
refle)cteti in aIl the other indùstnioe of the
country.
I was saying a moment ago that the idea
of credit is at the basis of ail tradiing anti
industrial operations nowadays. It bas been
develoypeti in certain parts of the Uniteti
States to such an extent that the wholesale
merchant to-day can secure absolute insurance for his trading aocounts. Credit associations in the Unitedi States to-day are issuing
to wholesaie merchants insurance by which
they guarantee that ail lis trading accounts
will be paiti in fuli, anti so weil is the systemn
organizeti, s0 thorough anti complete is the
supervision, that the actual ioss on insurance of that kinti to-day is less than one-tenth
of one per cent. I mention this fact for the
purpose of showing how dereliet we have been
in not extentiing to the best of our industries
such means of tioing business as are availabie
to every other industry in the country.

The preference of the person who lentis
money-I mean, not the man who wants usurious interest, but the ordinary money lenderis to lenti his money where he can get it 'back
when be neetis it. He tioes flot want to immobilize-4f I may use that word-bis icapital.
For that reason he is flot in a position to lend
to the fariner; or, rather, the fariner bas no
advantage whatever in seeking money from
that particular person.,
I bave given the matter some tbougbt, anti I
do think, anti urge, that the Government
would be perfectly justifieti in arranging anti
providing for 'Canada some system, similar
to that which bas proveti so eminently successfui in the Uniteti States. It woulti be
ampiy justifieti on the groundis wbieh have
been urged by my bonourable frientis who
have precedeti m1e, anti because of the neeti,
to whieh slight reference bas also been matie,
for filiing Up this country witb population.
If you peruse Dr. Tory's report you will see
that this systemn is in effect to-day practically
qll over Europe. It is practised in the countries whicb are seeking to obtain population
fromn the very quarters in which we are seeking
it. In New Zealanti anti in Australia the
systeým has been in force for years, anti by this
means, together witb their schemes of landi
settiement, they are enabieti to get the best
of immigration where we -cannot get any. So
successful bas been tbis manner of financing
the fariner in the Uniteti States that in the
last ten years a great many of our own farmers in the West have left their 'lads in Canadla to go anti purchase landis in tbe Uniteti
States, because ýthere they would have financial
facilities to a very large extent. Dr. Tory
mentions the fact in bis report.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: Canadian farmersh'ave
gone into New Engianti anti clone the same
tbing.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Tbey bave gone
to New Englanti anti to tbe Pakotas anti
Minnesota anti that region, for tbe purpose
of taking ativantage of those financial. arrangements. They 'borroweti money, 'anti with this
anti what they alreatiy hati they have purcbaseit lands. They can take thirty years
to pay off the Mans. Tbey are improving their ¶andim and- cai'rying on intensive
cultivation.
I may be carrieti away by my
own impressions, but I cannot see that there
is anything more beneficial or anytbing more
justifiable tbat tbe Government of Canada
couid do to-day than to provitie, very much
in the way it has been dlone in thes United
States anti in Europe, this financiai. credit
for the farmers.

SENATE

I have taken longer than I intended.
The
ground had been pretty well covered by my
honourable friends who preceded me, and I
rose merely for the purpose of emphasizing
the importance of the subject.
It is now ten
or twelve years since I studied the question
and gave it a good deal of attention.
I have
not had occasion to consider it much since
but the speeches to which we have listened
reminded me of what my impressions were
at the time.
Personally I feel quite free to
join our friends from the West who have
spoken, and I do so with very great pleasure.
I am speaking now not for the West alone, but
for the East as well, because I think the East
has just as much benefit to expect from this
system as the West.
I do hope that the
matter will be taken up very seriously by
Members of Parliament and by the Government. and that we may have, if not this year,
at a very early date- the sooner the bettersome Act which will help to overcome the
present agricultural depression,
meet the
needs of immigration and promote the
future
development
of the best
and
surest of our industries.
It does look,
after al], as if Canada would become the
granary of the world. I do not think that
is a vain boast. The country to the south
is filling up. The attention of our neighbours is directed more to industrial pursuits
than to agricblture.
If they continue to
increase ýtheir population as they are now
doing, they cannot ithemselves provide al!
they need in the way of food; they must
have recourse to Canada. Now is the time
for us to prepare and put our agricultural
industry on a basis which will insure the
benefits that are in store for us.
May I add this, honourable gentlemen? I
have thought more than once that we in
Canada have made and are constantly making a very serious mistake. If we consider
for a moment what it is thait God has given
us and what are the real natural resources
of Canada, we come immed-iately to the conclusion that they are our fertile fields, our
forests, our fisheries and our mines. These
are the resources which we have in plenty,
and it is to them that Canadians ought to
apply all their energies and activities. We
have made and are making a mistake in
trying to establish in this country what I
would call artificial industries; the textile industry, for example. We bring cotton a
distance of hundreds or thousands of miles to
textile mills in Canada. This is not the
place to manufacture coton. God never intended it so. No cotton is grown in this
country. Why cean we not devote our attenHon. Mr. BELCOURT.

tion, our brains, our energies and our time
te cultivat.ing and developing just what we
have here, without seeking to establish artificial industries which are constantly demanding protection, bonus, or assistance of some
kind or other?
It seems to me that if
Canada is to eseape from the bad hole in
which it is now, we must put on our thinking-caps and do some serious
thinking.
We cannot go on as we have been doing for
so long, depending on the fertility of our soil
and forests and fisheries and the abundance
of those supplies with which God has blessed
us; we cannot go on indefinitely bragging
about what we have got, while taking no steps
to coordinate things, and carry on with
business methods. We cannot go on wasting
as we have been wasting. This country will
not survive if we do not apply business
methods to our different resources, if we do
not try to conserve and preserve them.
Canada cannot stand the pace of that
tremendous country next to us; it cannot
stand the gigantie development that is going
on there, a development in every direction
and every branch of business, commerce and
industry.
We are under climatic and other difficulties
here. We are a great people, we are a good
people, we are a sane people, we are an intelligent and talented people; but these alone

trust to our talents alone: we must work; we
must think out things, -and work them out on
sound econoimile iprincilples, and sound and
proved business methods. Let us begin with
our agriculture.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gentlemen, I feel like congratulating myself
for having suggested to the honourable gentleman from Moose Jaw (Hon. Mr. Willoughby)
that he should proceed with the discussion of
the question which he had on the Order Paper.
He was first disposed to sec what the Government was ready to do this Session. I suggested that we would hear him, and that the
Government would hear him also.
Now we have had from the honourable
gentleman from Red Deer (Hon. Mr. Michener) and the senior member from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Belcou-rt) two splendid additions
to the statement made by the honourable
gentleman from Moose Jaw, and I am quite
convinced that the Government will be wiser
in continuing the study that it has undertaken towards a fair and happy solution of
rural credit.

te carry those dead limbs, those unproductive
enterprises such as the steel plant and ship

may be se, or they may be partly true or
partly untrue, or wholly untrue; but those
are the things that are causing discontent
among the men. These statements have net
been proven one way or the other.
I hope, and I have reason te believe, that
a better feeling is now prevailing down there.
I used te feel humiliated a few years ago
when we would see those wild communistic
resolutions passed down there, for I knew that
they were net the opinions or sentiments of
the great body of law-abiding working people
in the coal mines of Nova Scotia. Nowhere
on this continent is there a more orderly,
peace-ioving and intelligent body of men than
those who are working in the Nova Scetia
coal mines. The Union in 'District No. 26
has no greater enemy in the province of Nova
Seotia than MeLachlan and his crowd. He
se antagonized the Company by his conduct
in asking for and obtaining a repudiation of
contracts. and by his order for striking on the
job, that he lost the confidence of the United
Mine Workers, and be has been made ineligible for any representative position, or
any office in the Union of Coal Mines.

-tatement te some extent. I was down in
Halifax in the year 1923, just a week before
Christmas, when Cape Breton coal was selling
there for $11.50 a ton. A few weeks afterwards I was told that here it was as high
as $12.50. That is a matter of some concern,
a matter that ought te be inquired into. I
was down with a deputation from my own
town, and was discussing some matters of
interest te the northern side of the water with
the Premier, and I told him that something
should be done about that, that there should
be some inquiry by someone, and that I did
not know of anybody that was more directly
charged with responsibility for making that
inquiry than the Covernment itself.
But
nathing was done. I want te say that after
an inquiry the people will know and the
miners will know whether or net the statements that were made te them are correct.

wage, even a generous wage, for the hazardous
occupation in which they are engaged.
I believe that the Premier of Nova Scotia
has been endeavou-ring te arrive at a settlement, and I have confidence that ultimately
this matter will be adjusted. The people
generally are anxious for a settlement of the
difficulty, and this body, for instance, has
been endeavouring to find a solution. My
honourable friend from Welland (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) showed last night that he was
trying to find some means of settling the
difficulty.
I think a great mistake was made, and I
regret it. Previous to the last conference Mr.
Armstrong promised a board to consider this
whole question, the findings of the board,
whatever they might be, te be compulsory.
The company at that time offered to pay
during the course of inquiry the rate of wages
paid during 1924, but the offer was refused.
At the time of the last conference, when
Mr. Armstrong was making a final attempt
to get the men and the company together,
the men had receded from their first position
of asking an advance of 10 iper cent, and had
said that they were willing to take the wages
of 1924, but the company refused to make
any concessions whatever.
As to the suggestion made by the honourable gentleman from Welland (Hon. Mr.
Robertson), I think that perhaps he asks
more than the Province of Nova Scotia could
give, namely, that the province should remit
the entire royalty on coal. This year the
production of coal has been very smail, and
as a consequence the royalties have been
very small. It seems to me that if half the
royalty were remitted, say 66 cents a ton. it
might go a long way towards effecting a settlement, and might be sufficient to induce the
company to accede te the demands of the
men for pay on the 1924 scale.
The Government of the Dominion, I am
glad to say, has made two efforts to assist
this important industry of the Maritime
Provinces. Last year there was an allowance
made on freight te assist in the shipment of
Maritime coal te points further west in the
Province of Quebec and the Province of Ontario; and this year a very valuable concession was made, particularly valuable te the
Island of Cape Breton, in regard te shipments
by water. But I believe there is something
else which should engage the attention of
the Government-perhaps net at the present
time when it bas te provide se much money
for obligations already undertaken-and that
is the question of the feasibility of some
scheme te make it possible to take Nova

225

MAY 6, 1925
Scotia coal into the Great Lakes. The eost
of transporting coal from Cape Breton to
Montreai by rail is something like $3.60,
whereas by water, in ordinary times, it can be
carried for something like &à cents.
Our
railways have ail they can do to carry on
and even with the iniprovements mnade by
Sir Henry Thornton in reducing the obligations of the road, any concessions made by
the railways wiil be only of a temporary
character. But if the canais between Montreal and Lake Ontario were deepened to 22
feet, coal couid be shipped in cargoes of
4,000 or 5,000 tons direct from the mines
to ports in Ontario without breaking bulk.
In my judgment that would be a benefit not
only to the coal mining industry of Nova
Scotia, but wou!d to a large extent relieve the
Province of Ontario in its present dependent
position in regard to coal. And let there be
no doubt about the abiiity of the coal fields
of Nova Scotia to furnish ail the bituminous
coal consumed in Ontario. In the county of
Inverness there are some of the finest coal
fields in the Province of Nova Scotia with
veins ten f eet thick, eight feet thick and six
feet thick, aIl capable of producing coai
unsurpassed by any in Nova Scotia except
that in the territory from which. I corne,
wbich produr-es the best coal in the province. Seventeen square miles of these fields
are now under iease, and there are other
fields, owned by an honourable member of
this Huse, where there are two excellent
seams of coai, one eight feet thiek and the
other five feet thick; and if the Government were to acquire the shore road in the
county of Inverness there is a probability
and aimost a .certainty that the requirements for bituminous coal and coal for coking,
and even coal to suppiant anthracite to a
large extent, eouid be suppiied froni the isiand
of Cape Breton.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
debate was adj ourned.

RETURNS TO ORDERS OF THE SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I desire to lay
on the Table a return to an order of the
Senate dated March 19, 1925, showing a
copy of Order in Council P.C. 3887, of the
12th of October, 1921, a statement of expenditures, and copies of correspondence.
This was moved for by 'the honourable gentleman from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach).
The honourable gentleman yesterday referred to another Order in Council which had
been asked for, but I find in a letter from
the Under-Secretary of State that it was laid
on the Table of the House on the 21st of
April, 1925. I may as well read the letter,
as it may cover some other ground.
I see by the Debates of the Senate for yesterday,
the 6th of May, that the Honourable Senator Griesbach
complains about two Returns not having been brought
down.
One relates to Order in Coune
P.C. 3887, 12th
October, 1921.
I may say that the Department
understood that some of the information required
by this Order could be supplied by the Department
of National Defence, and a request for it was made.
An answer was not given until this morning when,
having telephoned in the matter, the Department of
Defence states that it has no information. The return
is herewith.

-That

is the one I have just filed.

The second relates to a copy of Order in Council
P.C. 2378. This return was presented on the 28th

of April last.

REPRESENTATION IN THE HOUSE OF
COMMONS
ERROR IN TRANSLATION
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: I desire to draw
the attention of this honourable House to the
motion which appeared on yesterday's Order
Paper in the name of the honourable gentleman from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton). In the English version it reads
as follows:
That in the opinion of the Senate an humble
address should be presented to His Majesty, praying
that the British North America Act be amended so
as to reduce the representation in the House of
Commons te the end that the whole representation
in that House be substantially decreased.

. In the French version, in the fourth line,
it reads:
-in order that the representation of the Province of
Quebee in the House of Commons-

I think it is only fair that the translation
should be corrected, and that the French
version should be made to read exactly as
the English version does. I would move
accordingly.

TIe Hon. the SPEAKER: I may explain
for the information of the House that the
Clerk drew this matter to my attention this
morning antd maie inquiries about it. He
has now informed me that the difference is
due to an error on the part of the translator,
who got an incorrect copy of the English
version and made the translation from it
without comparing it with the original. The
Clerk will of course see that the correction
is made. I do not know that it is necessary
for the honourable gentleman to make a
motion.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Is the notice
still on the Order Paper?
Hon. Mr. LYNOH-STAUNTON: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not suppose a motion is necessary. The notice will
appear to-morrow in proper form.

is natural inciinajti.on for the arimy was
eariy in evidenjce. Ait ýthe age of 14 he commnznad the Montreal High School Cadet
Rifles. He joined the Milîitia, and wae always
an acetive.member. H1e took part in the Northwest canlpaign. of 1885.
Since 1904 be has served the state as one
of the chief officers of Parliament. During
the Sessions we have had daily contact with
him, and constant opportunity to appreciate
his lovabie qualities. The Government on
many occasions utilized his services as officiai
representative, because of his dignity, bis tact,
his knowiedge of men, and his affabiiity.
I desire to. express to Mrs. Chambers and
her fa.mily our deep and heartfeit sympathy
in their great bereavement.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGRlEEtD: Honourabie gentlemen, we were ail startled. this
morning when we took up the morning paper
and saw recorded the death of our highly
esteemed friend, Colonel Chamnbers, Black
iRod, of the Senate. H1e was ini bis place at
the iast sitting of this Chamber, attending to
the duties wbich he had so weli performed
for the past 21 years; and doubtless he looked
forward to giving severai years more of service not oniy to the Pýarliament of Canada
but to the nation.
I have always been proud to cali Colonel
Chambers my friend. I knew him. most intimately, having for about 35 years been more
or less closeiy associated with him. In his
earlier years he was indentified with the Press
of the Northwest Territories. As my honourable friend has said, he fought in the second
Riel Rebellion in 1885, under -General Middleton, and then returned to his native city,
Montreal. H1e was afterwards secured as the
editor of what is now known as the Calgary
Heraid, a very influential paper, and he came
to the city in whieh 1 live for the purpose of
editing that paper. H1e served the community
well. The ability which. he brought to bear
in editing thatt paper reflected the bighest
journalistie qualities. H1e in time returned
to Montreal, baving secured more favourable
employment, and was afterwards engaged on
the leading newspapers of that city.
I know of no man in my list of acquaintances who possessed so many charming qualities and sucli a gracious personaiity as the
late Colonel Chambers. One cannot think of
a quality thqt would appeal to human nature
that was ned present in his character. fis
friends were legion; I neyer heard of bis

having an enemy, or of his uttering a harsh
word to a fellow-being.
11e was one of the most industrious men
within the range of my acquaintance. As has
been pointed out by my honourable friend.
he was not only a journalist, but he was a
writer of many books, and lis contributions
to the national history of our country are
many and valuable. 11e was the Secretary
of the Empire Pariiamentary Association, and
did more than any one man in Canada to
cernent the ties befween this country and
Great Britain in connection with that organization. H1e toolc the deepest interest in
military work. Not only did be serve in the
second Riel Rehellion, but from that time
down to the present he was a prolifie writer
on military subi ects, and was identified very
closeiy with ail the important military work
of this Dominion. We ail know that be was
the Chief Censor for the Goverument during
the Great War, and in that capacity he
rendered most valuable service to Canada.
H1e performed the duties of bis office as
Black Rod of the Parliament of Canada in
such a manner that it is not reflecting -on bis
predecessors wben I say that no man could
bave rendered more valuabie service in that
office than was performed by Colonel Chambers. No man in Canada bad sucb a knowledge of parliamentary preredent, parliamentary lore and tradition, and ail of the functions
and pageantry of Parliament. Tbe Parliament of Canada as well as the Government
reiied on Colonel Chambers as an autbority
on ail those important matters.
fis death wa s o startingly sudden as to be
almaost tragir. Knowing him întimately, as I
dîd, 1 believe that be was unaware tbat he
stood so neair the tbreshoid of deatb. We
ail join in the sentiments wbich bave been
expressed by tbe bonourable leader of t'be
fouse, and extend to bis widow and cbildren
the deerest sympatby of tbe Senate. Canada, and the Parliament of Canada particube
larly, wvil1 tbe poorer because of bis deatb.

The time within which the various Provinces of
Canada may earn and be paid the sums allotted to
the said Provinces under the provisions of The
Canada Highways Act, chapter fifty-four of the
statuýtes of 1919, as extended by chapter four of the
statutes of 1923, is hereby extended for a further
period of two years.

It may be of -interest to honourable members of this Chamber to know the Provinces
that have earned the full amount of their
appropriations under the Highways Act. They
are New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, British
Columbia, and Ontario. In the case of Ontario, $300,000 is held back to ensure completion of three specific contracts.
The following Provinces will require additional road-making seasons to earn their
full allotment: Saskatchewan, three roadmaking seasons, including this year; Manitoba,
two road-making seasons, including this year;
Prince Edward Island, two road-making
seasons, including this year; Alberta, three
road-making seasons, including this year.
Quebee should complete its work this year.
I will place upon Hansard the summary of
projects under agreement between the Dominion Government and the various provinces
as of the 28th of February, 1925:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am not a-ware
of any 0uch expression of policy. Ail that I
know is what we are now doing extending
aid for the completion of the works under
the original grant.
I will inquire whether
any polcy of further expenditure bas been
determined upon or expressed.

parts of the Bill were accepted by this Chaniber, and, if my recollection does not fail mie,
the balance was postponed for further consideration if it sbould come to us in the
next Session.
I understajud that practically
the samne clauses which were suspended last
Session have been embodied in the Bill which
I now have the honour of presenting for
second reading. There are one or two s!iglht
variations of minor consequence which 1
will indicate in Committee. I believe that
the origin of the Bill of this Session is the
saine as the one of last year-tbat it is based
upon the report of a committee of the Hoîîse
of Commons that sat upon it neariy the
whole Session.
This Bill now comes to us. I need not
dilate upon its variouýs aspects on the motion
for the second reading, because we will examine
the various clauses minutely wben they come
before the Committee of the Whole House.
If further explanation is sougbt by honourable
gentlemen of this Chamber at this stage I will
hav e to go into it, but I shaîl content myseif
for the moment with moving the second reading of the Bill.

was read the second time.

PENSION BILL
SECOND RIEADING
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND
moved the
second reading of Bill 70, an Act to amend
the Pension Act.
He said:
Honourable gentlemen will remember that towards the end of last Session
a Bill containing certain amendments to the
Pension Act came to this Chamber. Some
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Last year I
thought it opportune that the Bill should be
examined before a select committee. I arn not
wedded to the formi whieb the committee
should take-wbether it should be a standing
committee or a special committee; 1 amn ready
to listen 'to the voice of the Senate on that
question; but I believe that the Bill should
be sent to a committee, -where we cou'ld bave
the advice of technical experts.

MAY 12, 1925
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: As the Leader of
the Government has said, the Bill before us
contains a large number of clauses which were
rejected last year under circumstances familiar
to all the members of the House, having
reached us in the Rast twenty-four hours of
the Session. In the present Bill, however,
there are sone new and interesting clauses
which, in my judgment, might after consideration be improved and amended. I propose to
move, therefore, thaît the Bill be referred to
a special committee of the House.
I would draw the attention of the House to
the fact that we shall shortly have before us
another Bill dealing with ex-service men's
affairs-the Canteen Bill, disposing of the
Canteen Fund. Many honourable gentlemen
have received telegrams and other communications from representatives of ex-service men's
organizations, making certain representations
in regard to the Bill, and asking that they be
heard. The only way in which they can be
heard is by a special committee of the House,
and I take it that if a special committee were
appointed to deal with the Pension Bill, in
due course the Canteen Bill. could also be
submitted to that committee.
The House and the country have become
aware of certain disquieting rumeurs and statements in connection with funds held by the
Government in trust for ex-service men:
therefore, in drafting my resolution, I have
made provision to cover the points I have
just mentioned. The resolution reads:
That Bill 70, an Act to amend the Pension Act,
be referred to a Special Comnmittee composed of the
Hon. Messrs. Belcourt; Black, Dandumnd, Laird,
Lougheed, Macdonell, Pardee, Robinson, Ross (Moose
Jaw), Sharp. Turgeon, and the mover, and that the
said Committee be empowered ito inquire into all
matters concerning the Oaînteen Fund and the Diablement Fund, with power to send for persons ard
papers, and to examine witnesses under oath.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Before this motion is iput to 'the House, the House should
first paes the second reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bibi was
read the second time.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I now -move my
motion.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may say that
I aln somewhat hazy as to the forn of this
motion. I can see no objection to the first
part of the motion, which has to do with the
reference of the Bill to a Special Committee;
but the honourable gentleman goes one steqp
iurther, and asks that the Canteen Fund and
the Disablement Fund also be referred to the
committee.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Is -the Bid before the
House?

U3

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
gentleman has not mentioned a Bill. He has
mentioned the Fund. Of course, there is a
Bill concerning the Canteen Fund which has
just reached this Chamber -and been read a
first time, and wh&oh has been put down for
second reading on Thursday. Would it not
be more regular for my honourable friend to
await that BUit on Thursday, and when it has
passed its second Treading, then to ask that it
be referred to the sane commiittee?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The resolution
provides for the reference of the Pension Bill
to the committee, and, as my honourable
friend suggests, it goes furtbher and provides
for a reference to the same committee of the
Canteen Fund and 'the Disablement Fund.
The Canteen Fund there referred to is not to
be confused with the Bidl which disposes of
the Canteen Fund. The Bill ddsposing of the
Canteen Fun-d is one thing, but the history of
the Canteen Fund is another.
The Ganteen Fund has been in the hands of
the Governîment for some five or six years, and
during that time inteorest has adcumulated and
certain surms have been taken out of the Fund,
and it is with respect te that withdrawal of
funds that I desire the inquiries to take place.
When the second reading is reached of the
Bil whic'h proposes to distpose of sucih funds
as now remain in the' hands of the Government, as distinct fr.om ahl the funds, It may
be deaIt with by the House as it sees fit; but
the niere fact that the sae words are used
in describing the Canteen Fund should n'ot
m'islead the House as to 'the Bi@ being one
thing and the Canteen Fund another.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlemen, I have no objection to the purpose of
the motion being attained, but I do not think
it is in order te refer in this way a matter
connected with another Bill which is on the
Order Paper of the House. We would be
liable to have two different reports, one by
the Committee to whieh the present Bill is
referred. and another on the Bill relating to
the Fund. I think the honourable member
should accept the suggestion of the honourable leader of the House and drop the latter
part of his motion. He can attain bis purpose in a day or two. When the other Bill
is read the second time, it may be referred
to the same Committee.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:

GOVERNMENT

ANNUITIES BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 71, an Act to amend the Government Annuities Act, 1908.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the Annuities Act was passed in order G'o promote
habits of thrift and to afford the facilities
whereby people resident or domiciled in Canada might make provision for old age by
the purchase of annuities. It had been pointed
out that 95 per cent of people over the age
of 70 were dependent for support on their
daily earnings or the assistance of others, and
it was to anticipate such a condition of
affairs in the future in Canada that the Act
was placed upon the Statute book. Any one
over the age of 5 years may take advantage
of it. The minimum and maximum amount
of annuity purchasable was originally fixed

235

MAY 12, 1925
at respectively $50 and $600; in 1913-14 Parliament increased the maximum to 81,000;
and again in 1920-21 Vto$5,000, it having'been
considered that this amount was flot too large,
having regard to the rapid advanoe in the cost
of living. The object of the present, BI is to
reduce the minimum amount purchaseable
f rom $5 to $10 in ordier that eiuployers of
labour may purchase 4or their employees, or
assist themn in doing so, by a single premium,
what is known as Cumulative Annuities Vo begin
at some future age. For exa.mple, a man beginning !at 20 and buying an annuity of $10
eacrh year would find himself at 50 with an
assured income of $300 a year, Vo hegin at
465. Some employers are in the habit of giving
their employees cash bonuses for special services, and an annuity policy would preclude
the danger of such a bonus being frittered
away. Under the plan described Vhe employee
wvould have tangible evidence f rom year Vo,
year of the annuity he would receive. Each
transaction would be complote in itself,' and
he would be encouraged Vo increase his holding If the employee were Vo assist in the
purchase, his contribution could be made by
weekly deductions from his pay eheque, and
when the sum. required Vo be paid iby hian had
been accumulated it could be forwarded. to
Vhe Department by the employer. An interim
certificate Vo the credit of the employee could
issue, and after a certain number of these
had been secured they could ho consolidated
in one contract for more convenient preservation. On the ground that those things are
most cherisbed which involve somne personal
sacrifice, the co-operative systemn is the one
which should commend itself Vo the employee
and the employer.
The Act was for the first -three years of ita
existence (froan Saptemnber. 1908, to December, 1912) administered under the direction
of Sir Richard Cartwright, the father of the
A-e; in December, 1912, it was transferred
to the Post Office Department; andI in May,
1922, to the Departmen, of Labour, under
the direction of the Hon. Mr. Murdock.
When the Bill was introduced in the Gommons by Hlon. Mr. Fielding ho poi-nted out
that the Annuities Plan was noV to be confused with an old age pension scheme, which,
as commonly understood, iimpiies a contribution wholly or largely from the public treasury,
and that no benefits under the Annuities A.ct
would be obtainable except by purchase. The
rate of interest allowed on payments made
bas been froma the ibeginning 4 per cent compound,ed. This rate was at the time of the
commencement of the Act perhaps somewhat
larger than was the rate at which the Government could obtain money in the open imarket.

Up to the end of Marcà, 1925, 6,539 persons
had become purchasers of aninuities averaging
0f these 3,780 were maIes
in amount $28.
and 2,759 were femnales. These annuitants were
distri'buted as follows:
Ontario...........3,316
Quebec............1,140
British Columbia........641
360
Nova Scotia.. .........
New Brunswick..........W
Al'berta............256
Manitoba...........236
Saskatchewan..........200
Yukon.............25
Prince Edward Island.......22
The total amount received in purchase
money from September, 1908, to 3lst March,
1925. was $9,754,299.42.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
What is the present rate? Four per cent?
Hon, Mr. DANDURAND: The rate of intereet allowed on payments made has been
from the beginning 4 per cent, compounded.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: Is
that compounded annually or semi-annuahly?
Hon. Mr. DANDURANYD: I -have noV that
information, but 1 will geV it before we reacb
the committee stage.
The motion was.agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second ime.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The objeet of
this Statute is implied in its titie and dotermines the manner in which the Statutes
enacted from year Vo year by the Dominion
Parliament shaîl be prepared for printing and
shall be printed and bound, and how the
copies of the Statutes, both singly and collectively, shaji be distributed.
The principal reason for the present Bill is
that a revision of the Statutes is now in progress and the sections of the Statute now
existing, and determîning the manner in which
the Acts of Parliament shall be printed and
bound, are couched in Verms not now in common usuage and .not precisely in accordance
with the practice w.hich has been pursued for
many years.

SENATE
The changes bearing on these points and indicated in sections 10 and Il of the present
Bill are the outcome of a conference between
the King's Printer and the former Deputy
Minister of Justice, now the Honourable Mr.
Justice Newcombe, of the Supreme Court of
Canada, and at the time a member of the
Commission for the Revision of the Statutes.
It hais been thought desirable that in making this very necessary amendment to the
Statute advantage should be taken of the
opportunity to revise the Act generally, thus
bringing it into conformity with existing conditions and practices as to the printing, binding and dist-rhution of the Statute-. and the
ground for each of these minor changes is
indicated in the notes appearing on each right
hand page.
The appropriation, part of Vote 46-Printing, Binding and Distribution the Annual
Statutes-$16,000, page 16 of the Estimates,
1925-26, under the head of Legislation, is in
effect administered under the authority of the
Minister charged with the administration of
the Department of Public Printing and
Stationery.
Until the year 1920 this Department was
administered under the authority of the Secretary of State. In that year the Department
was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Minister of Labour. Ths change in administration necessitates a number of minor variations
in the terms of the Statute, and it has been
thought desirable to insert a new section
(section 2) bearing on this point.
Consultation with the Department of Justice resulted in the present measure being
drafted as a new and complete Statute rather
than as an amendment to the existing Statute,
and the present draft has had the approval
of the Department of Justice.
Section 1 was agreed to.
Section 2 was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
There is no
change in sections 3, 4. 5 and 6. except in
numbering.

The Clerk of the Senate, who is the Clerk
of the Parliaments, thought that there should
be inserted the words, " for the Receiver General." Of course, it is to the Receiver General that the money goes.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Who is

Mr. Blount.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The Clerk of the
Senate.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Is he -o
designated by statute?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I cannot tell, but
I know that wlhenever a certified copy of an
Act of Parliament has been required in the
past, the official to issue the certified copy
has been the Clerk of the Senate. That has
been the practice, but I cannot say w-hat is
the authority.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is by statute
that the Clerk of the Senate is made the
Clerk of the Parliaments. However, we wi'l
leave this clause as it is.
Section 7 was agreed to.
Sections 8 and 9 were agreed to.
On section 10-Acts to be printed in to
separate parts; what each shall contain;
printing, binding, and distribution:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
In paragraph
a of section 10 there is a slight alteration.
In the existing Act, it reads:
(a) The mambers of the two Houses of Parliament
respectively, who shall each be entitled ta receive
such nurnber of copies as is, from time to time,
directed by joint resolution of the said Houses, or,
in default of such reselution, as is directed by the
Governer in Council.

Under the proposed amendment the distribution would be directed by the Governor
in Council only.
Hon. W. B. ROSS:
Why should that
change be made at all?
Is the present
method not satisfactory?

On section 7-certified copies of Acts to
be furnished on application; fes thereon:

there a change in c'ause 7?

Hon. W. B. ROSS:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There is a suggestion that it should be enacted where that
money shall go.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
that is struck out is:

Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 were agreed to.

The Clerk of the Parliaments shall . . . . before
delivering it, receive a fee of two dollars, in addition to the cost of the printed copy.

Then, it will be as directed hy the Governor

MAY 12, 1925
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Hereafter
it will not require the other authority?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 'No; it will be
the Governor in Council only.
Of course,
I do not know how many copies each member
of Parliament is entitled to. My impression
is that we receive one copy, either in French
or English, or perhaps two.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I have never re'ceived more than one. That
bas been the practice, I think.
Hon. SMEATON WHITE: At the special
meeting on Thursday of the Joint Committee
on Printing we will have this question up, in
connection with the distribution of Senate and
House of Commons Hansards, etc. We cannot
find out who makes the rules. Has the Joint
Committee authority to make rules on printing, or is it, as it says here, the Governor
in Council? Would that be the Minister, or
by whom are the rules made? We want to
find that out.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I felt it my
duty to indicate to the Senate the amendinents
that were being made.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
not unreasonable.

That is

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I would draw
attention to the fact that the clause as it
stood stated that the members of the two
Houses of Parliament were to be entitled to
receive such number of copies as were directed
from time to time by joint resolution of the
said Houses, or, in default of such resolution,
as directed by the Governor in Couneil. If
we pass section 10 we strike out the words:
As is, froma time to time, directed by joint resolution of said louses, or, in default of sueh resolution.

That is to say, we strike out the reference
to a joint resolution, and I do not know
if it is the Printing Com.mittee who would
deal with the matter.
I suppose it should
be, but we abolish that right of both Houses
of Parliament to say what number of copies
of the Statutes would be distributed to each
member, and we leave it absolutely to be
dealt with by Order in Council.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I suppose there
are two reasons for the change; first, it is
made for the sake of uniformity, the Governor in Council, under paragraph a, being given
the power of determining the number of
copies to be issued to members, just as in
paragraph b the Governor in Council directs
the distribution to public departments, etc.
I should think it is rather a cumbersome

237

matter to have from time to time, or each
year, according to the wording of the old
section, a joint resolution of the two Houses
to determine how many copies of the Statutes
should be distributed yearly.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is
invariably done by the Printing Committee;
it is embodied in their report.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It was done in
that tvay because the Statute required it. It
said it might be by joint resolution of the
said Houses. That is now being done away
with, and I am suggesting that it is for the
sake of uniformity, and in order to get rid
of the cumbersome plan of having a joint
resolution passed each year. Now we leave
it in the hands of the Governor in Council to
make the lists that will cover the whole
ground.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Of course, after
this change is made Parliament could always
complain to the Government, and ask for a
larger distribution.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEEFD: Has this
resulted in any confusion?
Hon. Mr. POPE: Has there been any fault
found with the ¯Government in connection
with it?
Hon. Mr. DANDTURAND: I do not know
the history of it. I would call on the older
members of the House who were on the
Committee to say if they ever exercised that
right. Perhaps it was thought that as we
were not utilizing that privilege, it should be
left to the Governor in Council, in accordance
with other sections.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER:
There is a little doubt in my mind as to how
far this would go. As I understand it, this
has reference to the Statutes of Parliament
as they are passed, and their distribution?
Hon. Mr. DANDULAND: Yes.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Under the old form that was done, or was
supposed to be done, by a resolution of both
Houses. Everything was brought into the
open, and both Houses knew exactly the
number of copies that would be distributed;
when the resolution was made the whole
question could be debated as to how many
copies of the Statutes should be sent to each
member. Now the proposal is to do away
with that method. I was on the Printing
Committee in olden times, and my impression
is that that Committee never had the power,
or never took the power, of saying how many

SENATE
copies of the Statutes should be distributed;
neither do I remember of joint resolutions
opposing anything that may have been done.
Now the Council, that is, the .Government,
may decide the number of copies to be distributed; but if I, as one member, make
application for two or more copies, will they
have the right to distribute to me half a
dozen copies, if I so request, and if they think
I ought to have them? If that were the case,
we would have a very irregular system. I
presume what is ained at by this amendment is that every member of Parliament
should receive exactly the same number of
copies; consequently there wiil be no difference between them. It might become a very
expensive matter if the Government would
give the copies away. The copies of Statutes
are very fine things for lawyers, magistrates,
and others who are semi-judicial in their
habits of thought, but the proposed method
of distribution seems to me a little loose.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think there is
a clause providing for payment by the public
for extra copies.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER:
Yes, but that payment comes in after the
copies have been distributed, and the hands
of Parliament would be tied.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
Might I suggest to my honourable friend that as the
Chairman of the Joint Committee on Printing
(Hon. R. S. White) has announced that there
is to be a special meeting of that Committee
on Thursday, it might be well to let this
clause stand so that that Committee might
consider whether the proposal invaded their
prerogatives or not. I agree with the remarks
of the right honourable member from Ottawa
(Right Hon. Sir George E. Poster) that there
is an opportunity for an abuse under this
amendment. While it might never occur,
why should we make it possible? I have no
doubt the Chairman of the Joint Committee
on Printing will bring this matter to their
attention on Thursday next, and then we
might have a discussion on the subject which
would be helpful to the House.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: There is no change in
paragraph b; the change .is merely in paragraph
a, rellating to the distribution of copies to
members of Parliament-one oopy, or more
than one, aiccording to the decision of the Governor in Couni. Paragraph b deals with the
publiiic departmenits, administrative bodies and
officials.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have no objection to suspend this clause until next weelk,
Hon. Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

but I draw the attention of my honourable
friend to the wording of the Act as it now
stands:
As is, from time to time, direeted by joint resolution of the sid Houses.

Hon. SMEATON WHITE: That would be
the Joint Committee on Printing who would
make the joint resolution.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Well, we may
proceed with the other clauses, and leave ýthat
one in suspense.
Pamgraph a stands.
Paragraph b was agreed to.
On section 11-how statutes shaill be printed
and bound:
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Does this section as
read require the printing of 'copies to be in
the same style and condition as the present
copias, or is there any change?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
this section are:

The remarks on

The section in the existing Statute reads as
foiws:
14. The Statutes shall be printed in royal octav
form, on fine paper, in smal picn type, thirty-twq
ens by fifty-five ems, etc.

It is now proposed to substitute the foldowing words after paper:
In eleven point type, net more than four and
three-quarter inches by eight and one-half inches
deep.

This is some Greek to me. The memorandum wMch I have on this says that the proposed amendment discards obsolete printers'
phraseology, and substitutes modern trade
terms. It wil be for the gentlemen connected
with that business to say if these expressions
are the modern ones which are used in the
new section Il. I presume they are.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Perhaps the bonourable gentleman from Montrealý woulidi tell
us what difference this witI make in the present
mode of iprinting. WiB these new ternis in
section 11 require a different mode of printing,
and, if so, in what way? I do not know anything about ll,point type.
Hon. SMEATON WHITE: No, I do not
think it will make any difference. In one
case the type is called pica, and in the other
it is called 11-point type. All type is "point"
now, whereas the size used is to be known by
name. The change in phraseoiogy refers to
the size of type.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
Is it the same
thing in other words?
Hon. SMEATON WHITE: Yes, I would
say so.
Section Il was agreed to.

MAY 12, 1925
On section 12-as to Bills assented to during a Session:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The words
"Secretary of State" are replaced by the
underlined word "Minister," and the word
"part" is substituted for "volume."
Section 12 was agreed to.
Section 13 was agreed to.
On section 14-record to be kept by King's
Printer of number of copies distributed.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I inquire
of the leader of the Government as to the
meaning of the word "disposition" in this
section? Does it mean that the King's Printer shall distribute direct from the Printing
Bureau to the persons to whom the copies
of Statutes are addressed, or will they come
through the usual course of the Distribution
Office?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The word "disposition" refers to the names of the people
to whom the statutes are sent or distributed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I find the
answer in the commentary on the right-hand
page:
14. This information has long appeared in the annual
Report of the Department of Public Printing and

Stationery.

Section 15 of the existing statute corre-

sponde to this section. It reads as follows:"15. The King's Printer shall, before the opening of
each session of Padliament, make a report in triplicate to the Governor General showing,(a) the number of copies of the Acte of easch
session which have been printed and distributed by
him since the then last session;
(b) the departments, administrative bodies, officers
and persons to whom the same have been distributed,
the number of copies delivered Vo each, and under
what authority;
(c) the number of copies of the Acta of each
session then remaining in his hands;
(d) a detaiied account of the expenses by hirn
actually incurred in carrying this Act into effect, so
that provision may be nade for defraying the same
after such account has been duly audited and allowed.
2. Such report shall be laid before each Houes of
Parliament within fifteen days after the opening of
each session therof."

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I assume my
honourable friend means to convey the impression to the House that "disposition"
means disposition under existing authority,
and not as the King's Printer may himself
determine.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No, it is the distribution under the reading of this Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It would be
under the Act.
Section 14 was agreed to.
Sections 15, 16 and 17 were agreed to.
Progress was reported.

CANADA-UNIED STATES BOUNDARY
TREATY
PROPOSED

RESOLUTION OF APPROVAL

The Senate proceeded to consider the Message from the House of Commons requesting
the Senate to unite with that House in the
approval of the Treaty and Protocol between
His M'ajesty in respect of the Dominion of
Canada, and the United States, for the further
demarcation of the international boundary
between Canada and the United States, laid
upon the Table of the House on Thursday,
the 26th February, 1925, which was signed
at Washington on the twenty-fourth day of
February, one thousand nine hundred and
twenty-five, and which was signed on behalf
of His Majesty in respect to Canada by the
plenipotentiary therein named.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This Treaty has
been distributed and is cle'r enough in its
terms to need but a very concise explanation.
It was signed at Washington on the 26th of
February last by the Honourable the Minister
of Justice, on behalf of His Majesty, in respect
of Canada, and by Secretary Hughes on behalf
of the United States. It was ratified by the
Senate of the United States on March 12th
last. Under its terme, the boundary line will
be readjusted in three respects, and the
Boundary Commission appointed under the
Treaty of 1908 will be continued.
Article I of the Treaty concerns the
boundary line along the Lake of the Woods
and the northwesternmost point of said lake,
The boundary line from the mouth of the
Pigeon River to the northwest point of the
Lake of the Woods intersects at five points
the boundary line from the northwest point
of the Lake of the Woods to the Rocky Mountains and leaves two small areas of 2j acres
of United States waters entirely surrounded
by Canadian waters.
Under this new treaty it is proposed to
make the southernmost intersection the meeting point of the two boundary sections instead
of the northwestern point given in the Treaty
of 1908, which will bring the water area in
question into Canadian territory.
Article II redresses or straightens the boundary line from Lake of the Woods to the Rocky
Mountains which, under the Treaty of 1908,
attempted to follow the curvature of the 49th
parallel. It gave a curve not exceeding 4
inches per 1* mile between boundary monuments which did not give satisfactory results.
Article III relates to the boundary line at
Passamaquoddy bay and Grand Manan channel between New Brunswick and Maine. It
extends its line 2383 meters through the middle
of Grand Manan channel to the high seas, as

SENATE

240

there was a small zone of waters of controvertable jurisdiction at that point.
Article IV provides for the continuance of
the work of the Boundary Commission. It is
compo-sed of one Canadian and one United
States Commissioner. Its original work is
nearing completion. It will continue to inspect,
keep in repair or re-locate the monuments
and buoys, and keep open the boundary vistas.
The boundary line between the United States
and Canada, including Alaska, is 5,520 miles
and is marked by 7,734 monuments. Over a
1.000 miles are timbered areas through which
a 20 foot vista has been eut. Boundary monuments are apt to deteriorate and vistas to close
hy the growth unless inspection is continued.
There will be no outlay for salaries on Canada's part, as the office of Boundary Commissioner has been merged with that of the
Director Gencral of Surveys, and the other
staff will be provided by the Topographical
or Geodetic Surveys.
The settlement of the boundaries is judged
to be of sufficient importance to be dealt with
ly treaty as they deal with territorial and
sovereign rights.
It is our good fortune in North America to
settle these matters in peace and amity by
negotiation, as in this instance, or by arbitration. It is important to have the boundary
monuments in good repair because we have no
-oidiers keeping their eyes upon them.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Wio were
the Canadian commissioners?
lion. Mr. DANDURAND:
The two commissioners who signed the Treaty?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:

Yes.

Secretary of
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
State Hughes for the United States, and the
Minister of Justice, the Hon. Mr. Lapointe,
as the representative of His Majesty in
respect of Canada. It now needs to be
ratified by both House of Parliament.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: By what
officials of the Crown was the recommendation made as to the change which has taken
place?
lon. Mr. BELCOURT: One Canadian and
one American.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Who would
it be-the Director General of Surveys?
The work has
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
been going on for a long time.
Honourable gentleHon. Mr. DANIEL:
men, while probably the matter is all right,
and has been carefully gone into, I think it
is only fair that the Minister should lay on
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND,

the Table of the Senate a map or maps showing the changes that are proposed. I notice
that one of these changes is down in the Bay
of Fundy, and I would like to know what
the change really is. I certainly think that
before we are asked to subscrihe to changes
of this kind-they may be important or they
may be unimportant-we should see them
portrayed by a map or maps showing just
what they are.
I may inform
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the honourable gentleman that I had the very
same feeling: I read the whole of the Treaty,
and I could not grasp the difference between
the Treaty of 1908 and the present one. I
could read the descriptions, but I could not
visualize them. This morning I asked the
Department of Interior to furnish the Senate
with a map that I could lay on the Table
so that all might have the same advantage
that I had last week when I went into one
of the departments and examined a map to
fnd out exactly what the Treaty meant. I
will defer the motion until to-morrow afternoon, or until we have the map.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
area of territory is involved?

What

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There is a little
alteration in the line which throws an area
of 2\ or 3 acres of water to the Canadian side
of the boundary; and abolishing the curvature
of the 49th parallel and making it a straight
line from the Lake of the Woods to the
Roeky Mountains would throw perhaps some
20 acres all told to the other side of the line.
That is all there is in it. It is most interesting to see the effect at the Lake of the
Woods and between New Brunswick and the
State of Maine. In the latter place all that
honourable gentlemen will sec is that the
line is projected two or three thousand metres
further towards the sea.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Is there
any settlement on any of the territory involved?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Not on the watery
part.
Hon. Sir JÂMES LOUGHEED: It is not
all water. I understand there is some land.
Are we taking in any of the American population, or are we giving some Canadians to
them?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I stated that
there was a difference of, I think, 4 inches
in a mile and a third.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That would
be a very narrow farm.

MAY 12, 1925
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: What is the change
in the boundary between Grand Manan and
the mainland?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:, There is no
change whatever on land; it is a water line
which is extended further towards the sea.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: That means that you
are giving so mucli more to the United
States?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend wilýl find that for himself when hie
looks at the map.
Hon. Mr. BELCOtJRT: May I sugge to
my honourable friend that if lie is going ta
bring down a map it might be as well to have
it accompanied by a report of the comms-sioner so that it wiIl be intelligible.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is quite clear.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: We have already
given the United States the whale northern
part of Maine. Now I suppose we are going
ta give them the Bay of Fundy?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No. Here is
Article III:
Whereas the Treaty conoluded on May 21, 1910,
between Gret Britain end the United Status, defined
the internsabional boumdary lino between the Dominion
of Canada and the United States from a point in
Passa-aquoddy bay lying between Treat Island and
rmer Head ta the mniddle of Grand Manan channel
and provided that the location of the lino so defined
shonuld be laid down and onaTked by the Commissioners appointed under the Tresty cf April 11, 1908;
And whereas it has been found by the surveys
executed pursuant to the said Tresty of May 21, 1910,
that the terminus of the boundary lino defined by
sid Treaty at the middle of Grand Manan channel
is lem than three nauticai miles distant both frozu
the shore line of Grand Manan Island in the Dominioni
of Canada and frozu the shore lino of the State of
Maine in thse United Status, end that there is a amal
zone arf waters of controvertible jurisdiction in Grand
Manan channel between said terminus and the high
seas; -

The difficulty apparently arase out of the
'act that each claimed the three mile limit,
ind as there were flot six miles between them.
1he line had ta be defined.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: They had to go
aut ta a point where the bay apened out ta
six nautical miles.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
debate was adjourned.
LAKE 0F THE WOODS CONVENTION
RESOLUTION

OF APPROVAL

The Senate proceeded to consider the Message from the House of Gommons requesting
the Senate ta unite with that Hanse in the
appravail of the Convention and Protocol
S-16

241

between lis Majesty, in respect of the Dominion of Canada, and the United States of
America, for regulating the level of the Lake
of the Woods, and of identical letters of
reference submitting ta the International
Joint Commission certain questions as ta the
regulation of the levels of Rainy Lake and
other upper waters, laid upon the table of
the House on Thursday, the 26th of February, 1925, which were signed at Washington
on the twenty-fourth day of February, one
thousand nine hundred and twenty-five, and
which were signed on behaîf of His Majesty
in respect of Canada by the plenipotentiary
therein named.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, this Convention is the result of
negotiations under way since 1912, when the
regulation of the level and autflow of the
Lake of the Woods. was referred ta the International Joint Commission. The Commission
reparted in 1917; Canada accepted the recammendatians in 1919; the State of Minnesota
ahi ected. A conference was he'd in Ottawa
in 1922; further negatiatians were carried on
at Washington in 1923 and the present Convention was drafted. The Canadian Government ýaccepted it, but the United States,
mainly due ta local Minnesota apposition,
took no action until February, 1925, when the
Secretary af State stated that bis Government was prepared ta accept.
The treaty was ratified by the United States
Senate on Mardi 14, of the present year, and
I may say for the information af my hionaurable friend that it is practically an aIl
fours with an Order in Counicil passed at bis
own request in December, 1921.
The purpose of the Convention is ta raise
the level af the Lake of the Woods and ta
maintain it at as uniformi a level as possible.
mainly in order ta increase the power development on tie Winnipeg River. fiowing
ont of the Lake of the Woads. The dams
and other control works, and the enlargement
of the outlet from the lake. are being carried
on at the instance of tie Canadian Government under the recent Norman dam agreement effected by tic Minister of tic Interior
and ta wich Ontario and Manitoba have
consented. It is, however, necessary ta secure
the consent of the United States, as these
developments may involve flaading of the
low lands on the souti United States shores.
The Convention pravides briefly:
1. For thse estabaishrnent of a Canadien lake cf thse
Woods contrai board and alsa an international board
cf two engineers ta regulate the level of the lake whsn
it risse or fals below certain leveqs, with appusi, if
necew&ry, ta the International Joint Commiion.
2. Enlargements of the auties by the Dominion.

242

3. Assunption by the United States of liability for
flooding United States lands up te certain level of
lake and for certain protective works and alterations.
4. Agreement by Canada te pay the United States
in consideration of these undertakings $275,000 and half
of any additional sum expended within five years,
two-thirds of these amouis te be assessed on the
power companies benefited.
5. No diversion of water te any other watershed
except by agreement.

Accompanying the Convention is a protocol
providing:
1. Submission of Canadian outlets plans te the International board of contre].
2. Submission of United States protective works te
the international board of control.
3. Representation of Canada on tribunal te assess
land damages.
4. One
iemberof Canadien board te be also a
Canadian moember of the international board.

At the same time it is proposed to refer
to the International Jbint Commission, by
identical letters of reference, certain questions
as to the possibility of regulating the levels
of Rainy Lake (following into Lake of the
Woods) and other upper waters, the cost,
the proper apportionment of the cost, and the
nature and extent of interests benefltted by
the present developments on Rainy lake and
Kettle falls.
These undertakings of the two Governments,
by indentical letters of reference to the International Joint Commission, were the result
of considerable dscussion between the State
of Minnesota and the Federal authorities at
Washington. They did not see what interest
they had in the regulating of the level of
the Lake of the Woods, and they feared that
if that were accomplished and Canada were
given all that it wanted, the Rainy Lake and
tributaries to it would not be inquired into
by Canada, joining with the United States. So
all these matters have been cleared up. We
have got the undertaking of the work for the
maintenance of the level of the Lake of the
Woods, and we are joining with the United
States in asking the International Joint Commission to examine into the possibility of
regulating the levels of Rainy Lake.
I need not dwell upon the importance of
this work. Our friends from Manitoba know
exactly what it means to them. The International Joint Commission's extensive investigation of Lake of the Woods matters conclusively showed that the regulation of Lake
of the Woods in the manner they recommend
is most desirable in every respect. Navigation, fishing and lumbering interests will be
benefited, and in particular an adequate supply

of power to Kenora, Winnipeg and southern
Manitoba assured. Undoubtedly, the greatest
benefit to be derived from the Treaty under
question is the utilization of the lake with
its area of 1,485 square miles as a storage
reservoir te increase the outflow from 6,000
second feet to 11,000 second feet, and to
practically double the dependable flow of the
Winnipeg river from Lake of the Woods and
thereby assure an increase of 150,000 dependThe Winnipeg
able 24-hour horse-power.
river is practically the sole source of power for
southern Manitoba and it can safely be said
that the industrial growth in this district will,
in the main, be limited by the power available
on this river. Other than the developments
at the lake outlets, which include the Lake
of the Woods Milling Company, with an output under normal lake levels of 10,000
barrels of fleur per day, and the plant of
the Fetwatin Power Company, which furnishes puwer to flour and pulp mills and other
industries in the town of Kenora, there are
throe large developments on the Winnipeg
river in Manitoba, namely:
The City of Winnipeg plant at Point du
Bois. with a present installation of 74.400 h.p.
and a capital investment of over $13,250.000.
The Manitoba Power Company's plant at
Great Falls, with an installed capacity of
56,000 h.p., and an investment of $7,600.000.
The Winnipeg Electric Railway Company's
plant at Pinawa, with an installation of 37.800
hp. and an investnent of $6,200,000.
At the City of Winnipeg plant at Point
du Bois conditions are now such that full
storage on Lake of the Woods is urgently
needed to ensure operation of their plant to
capacity.
I therefore

move:

That the Senate doth unite with the House of
Commons in the approval of the Convention and
Protocol between His Britannic Majesty, in respect
of the Dominion of Canada, and the United States
of America, for regulating the level of the Lake of
the Woods, and of identical letters of reference submitting te the International Joint Commission certain
questions as te the regulation of the levels of Rainy
Lake and other upper waters, laid upon the table
of the House on Thursday, the 26th of February,
1925, which were signed et Washington on the twentyfourth day of February, one thousand nine hundred
and twenty-five, and which were signed on behalf of
His Majesty in respect of Canada by the plenipotentiary therein named, by filling in the blank space therein with the words, "Senate and."

REMISSION OF DIVORCE FEES
On the ninety-fifth and ninety-sixth reports
of the Standing Cornmittee on Divorce:
Honourable
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHIBY:
gentlemen, I wish to say a f ew words li explanation of a proposed change, which. does
not apply to these particular reports, but may
apply whenever the question of remission of
fees corne before the Senate. In ail cases in
which a remission of fees is made, where the
Petitioner cornes virtually in forma pauperis,
it has been our custom to remit ail the fees
except the printing charges. The printing
charges have been assurned for many years,
in fact since about 1912, to arneunt on the
average to $25. The cost of printing and
everything that goes with the publication of
our reports has încreased very considerably
in that time. I requested the Clerk of our
Comrnittee and others who are interested to
prepare an estimate of the average cost, and
they assure me that it would be about $40.
Therefore, in future, in reports on cases in
which there is to be a remission of fees, we
shail insert the words, "'less the sum of $40
In
for printing," or word-s to that effect.
contested cases the fees often run up to $300
or more, but we are flot dealing with sijeh
cases now.

And that the aaid Coenmittee have Power to und

I shaîl be very pleased to make an explanation of the rnotion if any honourable
gent!eman desires it.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Before putting
the resolution to the flouse, I would like to
point out that this Cornmittee is composed
of the sarne members as the Committee which
was appointed last night by the flouse to deal
with another matter, and the question occurs
te my mind whether it should net be done
hy way cf an instruction te that Committee
rather than by a resolution. I have net had
time te look into, the matter, and would net
like te express an opinion off-hand.
I understand
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the honourable gentleman is giving a notice
cf motion.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: No, he is asking, with the leave cf the Ilouse, that it be
now put. If the flouse prefers te leave it
as a notice cf motion, it may be dealt with
in that way.
Rt. Hion. Sir GEORGE E. ,FOSTER:
Aside from that question altogether, I think
it is only fair that the mover of a resolution
like this asking for immediate action should
give some grounds why he thinks it necessary te put the country to the expense of an
investigation. The grounds may be very
good-I confess that I know nothing cf thesu
-but it seems a little anornalous that we
should have a resolution of that kind witheut any explanation as te why the Committee
should be appointed.
The honourHen. Mr. DANJ3URAND:
able gentleman could perhaps give his explanatien now, or turm bis motion into a
notice of motion for te-rnorrew, and give the
explanation te-MOrreW. I suppose the Senate
as disposed te hear the honourable gentleman new; yet the notice of motion could
stand and be taken up to-qnorrow. As a
matter of fact, the Bill concerning the Canteen Fund will be taken up for second reading only to-mrnrew.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I have ne objeetien te the resolution standing as a notice of
motion; 'but I was under the impression that
it would have te stand until Tuesday, and I
should like te have it disposed cf without
delay. As to the suggestion that I should
give the grouands, I shail be very pleased to
do so.

SENATE

The House is probably familiar with the
method whereby the Canteen Fund was
created. An amount exceeding $2,000,000 was
sent to Canada in 1919-20 to be disposed of
by the Govemment of Canada. That Fund
has remained in the hands of the Government since that time, accumulating interest.
On several occasions, as disclosed by the returns brought down, sums of money have been
taken out of that Fund, and have been paid
to various persons and organizations. The
information before me is that on one occasion
$120,000 was paid out, and that upon another
occasion $50,000 was paid out. I submit that
ex-servicemen of the country have a right
to know what bas been done with this money.
After all, it is their money, as has been said
so frequently in the House: they have a
right to know who received the money and
what was done with it.
With respect to the payment out of $120,000,
apart from the names of the organizations
which received the moneysHon. Mr. LAIRD: What is the date of
the payment out of the $120,000?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The Order in
Council is No. 3887, of October 12, 1921. The
statement which I have received clearly shows
the persons and organizations to which the
money was paid, but as far as I can ascertain
no statenient has been submitted as to how
the moncv which the-e organizations received
was spent.
As to the previous Order in Council, granting $50,000 to the Great War Veterans' Association, a statement is submitted accounting
foi $28,449.50. and in the return submitted to
the House this statement appears:
Statements accounting
are not avaflable.

for the remaining

$21,550.43

Now, with respect to the statement in reference to the $28,449.57, I venture to assert
that ex-servicemen in the country wiltl not approve of the manner in which the sum of
money accounted for has been spent. There
are items here which I greatly question, items
of which I think t'he House should be made
aware.
Then, passing from the Canteen Fund to
the Disablement Fund, I may say that that is
a Fund .created by the generosity of Mr. James
Carruthers.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Before my honourable friend goes on to the other question, will
he permit me to say that for my part I should
like to know how the Canteen Fund was
created and what was its purpose. I do not
know anything about it.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I thought it was
a matter of common knowledge. The Canteen
Fund of the British Expeditionary Forces was
the surplus resulting from the operation of
canteens in the British Army on alil fronts
during the late war, amouniting to many millions of dollars, and' Canada's share was approxilmately something in excess of $2,000,000,
which was adjudged to be the property of the
soldiers. The problem before Canada for
some time has been an equitable division or
use of the money and that is provided in the
Canteen Bill.
Hon. Mr. TESSIER: Where did the money
come from?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Out of the pockets
of the soldiers, for eatables and drinkables
purchased at Army Canteens.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: And where has the
money lain?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The money has
been in the possession of the Government since
it was sent here from EngLand, after distribution in Engiland about 1920, and the interest
has been aceumnlîating. It is out of the interest tat payments have been nmade to different organizations.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Did any ipersons other
than the sobdiers themselves have anything to
do with the management of these canteens and
the earni-ng of the money?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The canteens were
run under militarv management aTl the way
through.
lon. Mr. TANNER: Whoilly by the soldiers?
lon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Wholly by military organizations.
Passing to the Disablement Fund, I may
say tint this Fund is a sum of money the
major portion of which, I think, was subscribed by the late Mr. James Carruthers, of
Montreal, and in addition to this subscription
there was a sort of campaign put on and a
sum of money wihich seems to aggregate about
$135.000 was collected, from which there have
been payments made in the way of smad loans
and so forth.
About the latter end of last year or the
early part of this year $15,000 was taken out
of this Fund, under circumstances, to put it
mildly, that invite inquiry. Honourable gentlemen will remember that I have asked a
number of questions with respect to this
Fund, and have had some difficulty in getting
at the facts.
In particular, I have endeavoured to find
out what was the basis of negotiations; that

MAY 13, 1925
je to eay, who saw whomn and who asked for
what. My inquiries so far lead to thie:
that on a certain date Mr. MacNeil, who ie
Secretary of the Great War Veterans' Association, and who was also Secretary or
Chairman of the Dominion Veterans' Alliance, which. was a federation of ail ex-service
men's organizations until it was recently di&rupted or desltroyed, called on the Minister
of Soldiers' Civil Re-establishmeiat and applied
to him for a Joan of $15,000 from the Disablemnent Fund for the Great War Veterane'
Association. In the Minister's reply, as far
as I have it, he refused to make a loan to
the Great War Veterans' Association, but
agreed to make a Joan froma the Disablement
Fund to the Dominion Veterane' Alliance,
and an Order in Council covering the transaction was passed in due course providing
that $15,000 should be taken from the Disablement Fund and loaned to the Dominion
Veterans' Alliance, and that it should be
repaid out of the sum of money wbich the
Minister expected at that time would be
voted in disposing of the Canteen Fund finatly
-under the Bill that is to corne before us,
$15,000 would corne out of that amount, which
in turu was to be voted practically to the
Great War Veterans' Association.
The Order in Council was passed on false
premises and niisinformation-one wondere
whether intentionally so or otherwise; but
the outstanding fact, so far as this discussion
is concerned is that the Order in 'Counoil
provides that there shail 'be loaned from. the
Disablement Fund to the Dominion Veterans'
Alliance the sum of $15,000. 1 shaîl contend
that the Minister had no authority whatever
to take any money out of the Disablement
Fund for the purpose in question.
,Now, the trustee of that Fund is Mr. ScammelI, Assistant Deputy Minister of Soldiers'
Civil Re-establishment. He proceede to check
out the $15,000 boan. He issues a cheque for
$1,000, and sulbsequentiy another cheque for
$1,000, and subsequently a cheque for 83,000,
and he makes these three cheques, aggregating
85,000, payable to the Great War Veterans'
Association. 1 submit that that transaction
is without any authority at all. I have already drawn attention to the fact that the
Order in Council provides for a Joan of
$15,000 to the Dominion Veterans' Alliance.
There is therefore no authority at aIl for
the payment out of the flrst $5,000.
The next two cheques are for $5,000 each,
and are made out in favour of the Dominion
Veterans' Alliance, being in accordance with
the Order in Council. As far as one can learn
from the Debates in another place, the in-

245

formation there given, and the replies and
returns to orders which I have received, Mr.
MacNeil, who is either Chairman or Secretary
of the Dominion Veterans' Alliance, and also
Secretary of the Great War Veterans' Association, took the cheques made out in the name
of the Dominion Veterans' Alliance and converted them ta the use of the Great War
Veterans' Association.
I submit that the facts as I have stated
them constitute a subject-matter of inquiry
which ex-servicemen throughout the whole of
this country, regardiese of the organizations
to which they may belong-and by far the
larger proportion of them do not belong to
any organization at alI-and lay upon this
House a duty which it cannot escape.
Passing from that ta the manufacture of
paper poppies, honourable gentlemen are
aware that once a year throughout Canada on
d «ifferent days which may be selected, soldiers'
organizations sell paper poppies, which, in the
first place, are manufactured by organizations
working under the control of the Department
of Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment, and which.
are by them sold ta veterans' organizations,
and by them retailed by way of tag days and
so forth. The impression has gone abroad that
one organization in 'Canada has a monopoly
of this sale. Ex-servicemen hear of differences
of prices, and this creates diffliiulty on re-sale,
and very few people know what becomes of
the money which is produced by the re-sale
of those poppies. It is desirable that some
authority, probably this House, should establish
the principles which are ta govern the sale of
those articles, because, after aIl, it is a Government undertaking. Then, I think that in
the interest of the subscribing public, whose
patriotism and sympathy are appealed ta on
these occasions, we should also have some
information as to what becomes of the money
they subscribe, and as ta alI the circumetances
that surround this transaction.
These are the three matters which, under
my motion, I desire ta have submitted to a
Committee of the House. Last night I sought
ta include them under the general reference
of the Pension Bill, to which, I might caîl a
soldiers' affaire Committee. I do not much
care how it gets there 80 'long as it does gel
there. We have ta deal to-morrow with the
Canteen Bill, which disposes of those funde,
I hope, for aIl time, and puts them heyond
the reach of those who Might abuse them, ta
put it mildly. As I pointed out last night,
the Canteen Fund Bill has nothaing whatever
ta do with the inquiry I desire to have made
into the Canteen Fund. The ('anteen BilI

is for the future, and my inquiry relates to
the past.
If I have omitted anything of interest, I
shal ýbe very glad to make expianation. I
do flot mind whether -my motion is submitted
as a notice or flot, but 1 arn desirous that
after this explanation the matter may be put
in such shape that we may proceed with the
inquiry without delay, hecause it may take
some time, and we may require to have a
D.umber of witnesses before the Committee.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER:
As I raised the question which resulted in
the information which has been given, I wish
to say I did not raise it because I had any
objection to the examination, but I thought
it was regular, and I desireýd the information,
for myseif and probably for others, that the
grounds for making the resolution should be
stated. The information having been given,
I think my honourable friend has made out
a prima facie case, and I have no objection
to the mnatter being deait with at once.
lion. Mr. DANDUR.kNi'D: I will net object
to the motion being adopted now. 0f course,
the statement which we have just heard presents certain serious aspetts, and the Ministers whose actions have been under discussion may possibly have a statement to
make. I will not suspend the passing- of this
motion, but when the Bill dealing with the
Canteen Fund comnes to-morrow, if the Minister who administers that fund, or at al]
events has it imder his supervision, desires to
make a statement, he will furnish me with
one.
lion. Mr. BELCOURT: It seems to me it
would be a decided aclvantage if this Committee did not meet until after the discussion
on the second reading of the Bill, which. is
on the Order Paper for to-morrow. I am
not of my honourable friend's opinion that
th2se two things are wholiy disonnnected.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The Committee will probably not meet until next

sure that it wiil flot meet until we have had

This Bill amends Section 2 of the Migratory
Birds Convention Act by adding naw paragraph aaa. This provides an addition to the
items respecting which regulations May be
adopted. This addition is made necezsary beciuse of a decision in the Court of Appeal
of Manitoba in the case of the King vs.
Douglas Stuart, which decision made it appear
that the prasent statute forbade the possession
of migratory gaine hirds lawfuliy takan during
the open season in any part of the closed
safison naxt following. Once this naw paragrapli aaa becomes law, regulations allowing
the possession of legally taken migratory
game birds during a part of the closed season
can be adopted and made to suit the conditions in each of the provinces.
The addition to Section 2, amending Section 5, of the Migratory Birds Convention Act,
is to provide for the appointment of ail Ontario ýGame and Fishery Officers as game
officers under the Migratory Birds Convention
Act. The Provincial Authorities have undertaken to have thair officers anforce the Act
throughout Ontario. They desire however,
that these appointments ha made by Act of
Parliamant, and that their officers should not
ba antitled to any part of fines imposed in
casas instituted by tliem, as provided in Section 12 of the Act. Provision lias bean made
for the appointmant by the Governor in

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
There is one question I would like to ask.
Ini tha explanations that my honourable
friand gave last night hae mentioned that in
1922 the adminiâtration. of this Act was passed
over to the Labour Department. I had some
knowledge of the Act and of the administration of it in earlier years, and it was afterwards passed over to the Post Office Department. My own view had been, and it is
yet to a certain extent-I have seen nothing
to change it-that the Act should be administered by the Finance Department. An
annuity is a financial transaction and the
Finance Department has its offices and its
officars for the management of financial
affairs. The Post Office has a similar management, and it was quite in order to transfer
it to the Post Office Department, but what
reason on earth there was for sending the
administration of a Government Annuity Act
to the Dapartmant of Labour I neyer could
ascertain. It would appear to, me that the
Labour Department had no special machinery
f or administaring a financial Statute of this
kind, whereas there was machinery in both
the other Departments.
Doas my honourable friand know the
reason which led to the change, and whether
or not it lias been found to work economieally?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I can give no
information to the right honourable gentleman on the two points which lie raisas. If
hie will allow this stage to, be takenRiglit Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Yes8. What I wanted was the information.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: At the third
raading I shal -have the information. I have
here an officiai of the Department, but very

on the policy which lias governed the change.

SENATE

CANADA-UNITED STATES BOUNDARY
TREATY
RESOLUTION

OF APPROVAL

The Senaste proceeded to the further consideration of the Message from the House of
Commons requesting the Senate to unite with
that House in the approval of the Treaty and
Protocol between His Majesty in respect of
the Dominion of Canada. and the United
States. for the further demarcation of ehe international boundary between Canada and the
United States, laid upon the Table of the
House on Thursday, the 26th February, 1925,
which was signed at Washington on the
twenty-fourth day of February, one thousand
nine hundred and twenty-five, and which was
signed on behalf of His Majesty in respect to
Canada by the plenipotentiary therein named.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I have procured for the honourable gentleman from St.
John (Hon. Mr. Daniel) a map showing the
line which is being extended between New
Brunswick and Maine; and another map I
have laid on the table of the House for the
information of the members generally. If the
honourable gentleman who guards particularly
the interess of his city and bis province is
satisfied, I will move the adoption of the resolutiu.

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I took the trouble
this morning, to go, as the honourable gentleman suggested yesterday, to see the Deputy
Minister of External Affairs. He explained to
me what was proposed regarding the boundary
extension in the Bay of Fundy. So far as
I can sec, it means the extension of the present boundary for a mile and a half. I do net
sec that it can interfere in any way, provided
our commissioners who are appointed to locate
the extended line look after our interests as
wt l as the commissioners of the United States
are sure to look after theirs.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: And have done
Co in the past.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Therefore, so far as
that is concerned, I am satisfied that the proposed boundarv will be al] right.
I may say that in this first map, which
comes. I think, from the Department of the
Interior, the Island of Grand Manan is shown
1n the Province of Nova Scotia.
One would
think they would know that the Island of
Grand Manan belongs to the Province of New
Brunswick, and for an expert geographer to
lay before the Senate a plan with such a mistake is a little curious.
With regard to the Lake of the Woods, I
have been trying to make out exactly what is
meant. The map appears to be rather con-

fused. I cannot see from the explanations
exactly what we give. What we get is very
plain:
it is about two and a half acres of
water. But what we give is, to my mind,
net plainly marked on the map. The honourable gentleman may know better and may
sec better than I can make out.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The difficulty
in indicating what we yield to the United
States lies in the fact that it is infinitesimal
at every part of the line. I stand to be corrected, because the figure which I gave yesterday is official, and I have not that figure
before me now, but I think it represents four
inches to every mile and one-third. The
at-tempted curvature of the 49th parallel was
directed to be straightened between the
monuments.
There is one mile and onethird between them; therefore, in order to
follow that parallel there would be on one
sidc of a straight line a curve averaging four
inches from one monument to another. It is
impossible to indicate on a map such a small
area. All along the line there is an attempt
to indicate that curvature. It bas been found
of very little practical value. The curvature having been in our faveur, and the line
being straightened, we lose on the average
four inches between each two monuments,
right through to the coast. It is pretty difficult to make an addition. It is reckoned that
the area may represent, on the whole, about
twenty acres, but at each part of the line
it represents only an average of four inches.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: What is not plain te
me there is how far the State of Minnesota
extends up alongside the line that is marked.
The Province of Ontario is on one side and
the Province of Manitoba on the other, and
to the south is the State of Minnesota; but
the map does net show very distinctly, te me,
the exact lay of the land. I refer to the small
mp, not the one at which the honourable
gentleman is looking. Perhaps other honourable members may understand it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I understand
that the line from the east and the one from
the west, on reaching the Lake of the Woods,
did net meet. For a certain distance one
line crossed and recrossed the other at several
points.
The line bas been straightened, and as a
result about two and a half acres of American
waters will now be Canadian waters.
This matter bas been very closely studied
by our officers, and I see some commendation
of the work that they have been doing.

SENATE

The Nova Scotia Government bas exclusive
jurisdiction over property and civil rights
within the province. It has granted the
British Steel Corporation its charter and it
owns the coal mines operated by that corporation.
The Nova Scotia Legislature, whieh bas just
prorogued, bas been dealing with the matter.
The honourable Senator from Welland has
made a suggestion which addresses itself
directly to the Government of the Province
of Nova Scotia and to its Legislature. It will
he for them to examine into it. It belongs
exclusively to their jurisdiction. My answer
would stop here if the honourable gentleman
had not expressed the opinion that one of the
main causes of distrust with the employees
comes from the action of the Federal authorities whom he seems to hold responsible
for the despatch of troops to the Sydney
mines towards the end of June 1923. The
honourable gentleman went further and argued
that this action was the remote but direct
cause which brought forth the judgment of the
Privy Council declaring ultra vires our Industrial Disputes Inve-tigation Act, as the
abece of forces in Toronto at that time had
propted the Labour Department to insist
upon an arbitral inquiry being held in the
matter of a threatened strike among the employees of the Hydro-Electric Commnission.
From my knowledge of the law and of the
facts, I must state that the honourable gentleman is totally in error. The Government
sent no troops to Sydney. The troops which
gathered there were called by the local
authorities under clauses 81 and 82 of Cha'pter 41, Revised Statutes, 1906. I am speaking
of the old law as existed in 1923. Clause 80
says that the Militia may be called out to
suppress riots, and clause 81 reads as follows:
The district officer command-ing in any locality, if
he is present in the locality and able to st, or if
he is not so preent, or from sickness or other cause
is unable to act, the senior officer of the Active
Militia in any locality, not from sickness or other
cause unable to act, shall cal out the Active Militis,
or such portion thereof as he considers necessary for
the purpose of preventing or suppressing any such
actual or anticipated riot or disturbance, when theraunto required in writing hy the civil authority herainafter designated in that behalf: Provided that so
far as the Permanent Force is available, a aufficient
nunber of the Force is to be employed upon the
duty of preventing or suppressing such actual or
anticipated riot or disturbance before recourse is had
to other militia corps, and sha replace such other
militia corps if so called out upon duty so soon as
and to the extent the Permanent Force shah thereafter becone available.

Clause 82 states who may make requisition
in general, and reads:
If the place where such riot or disturbance occurs
or is anticipated is municipally organized, the mayor
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

or warden or other head or acting head of the
municipality, together with two justices of the peace,
or in the event of such mayor, warden or other head
or acting head refusing or being unable to oct, the
county or district court judge or one of the county
or district court judges having jurisdiction in such
place, acting alone, or, if there is no such judge then
any judge of a superior court who has jurisdiction
in such place, Mnay by requisition in writlng require
the Active Militia, or such necessary portion thereof
to be so called out.

These two clauses indicate who can requisition, and to whom the requisition is to be
addressed. In this instance it was the county
court judge who made the requisition. which
under the Act was addressed to the district
officer commanding in the locality. Under
the terrns of that Act, Mr. Justice Duncan
Finlayson, a County Court Judge, in the
exercise of his powers signed the requisition.
The District Officer Commanding, at once
sent out his permanent force from his own
district and, judging that it was insufficient.
instead of calling out his non-permanent
militia, as he had a right to do. asked the
Militia Headquarters at Ottawa to send him
a certain number of permanent force troops.
The Militia Headquarters, following the
letter and the spirit of the Act, which directs
that the permanent force be preferably used,
complied with this request.
The honourable gentleman goes further and
gives it as his opinion that the troops were
not needed in 1923. It was not for the Goverament to decide that question; it had no
discretion in the matter; but the Government
set on foot an investigation into the industrial unrest among the steel workers at Sydney, creating conditions which had occasioned
the calling out of the active militia.
That Commission was composed of Dr
G. W. Robertson. J. J. Johnson, I.C., of
Charlottetown, and Mr. Fred Bancroft, of
Toronto. a well known labour representative.
Here are short excerpts froi their report,
which is unanimous:
A general strike was declared by the union and
began to take -place between 3 and 4 o'clock in the
morning of June 28th.
Fron the evening of June 28th gangs of strikers,
masked and in many cases armed with clubs, raided
the plant and fomibly removed men engaged in
maintenance work. That evening serions rioting took
place et No. 4 gate. Many assautts were made.
Stones and bottles were thrown. The Deputy Chief
of Police of Sydney was kicked when he had fallen
down. The local police were entirely unable to cope
with the situation and preserve law and order.
Magistrate W. A. G. Hill while reading the Riot Act
was struck on the head by a stone and afterwards
became unconscious. The nature of the situation was
brought to the attention of His Honour Judge
Finlayson, who sent a requisition for the Active
Militia to come in aid of the civil power.
During the following day, Friday, raids were made
on the coke ovens. In the evening a crowd numbering many hundreds was outside gate No. 4, throwing

SENATE

in bis forceful and convincing way, left the
impression that, in bis opinion at least, this
gentleman was not a desirable person to have
enter the Dominion of Canada.
I want to state, honourable gentlemen, a
few simple facts for the information of the
House, and then I will leave it at that.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I think I ought
to point out to the honourable gentleman that
he really bas no right to make a reply.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I beg the pardon
of the House if that is the case.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: The House, of
course, can give bim leave to do so; but
rule 36 says:
A reply is adlowed to a Senator who has noved
the second reading of a Bill, or made a substantive
motion, but not to'one who bas moved an amendment, the previous question, an adjournment during
a debate, a motion on the consideration of Conmons
amendments, or an instruction to a Conmittee.

The honourable gentleman will remember
that this is simply a question that calls
attention.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I bow to the
decision of the Chair, and would respectfully
ask the consent of the House to continue for
a few minutes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND,: I would draw
the attention of my honourable friend to the
fact that the honourable gentleman who followed him (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) may ask the
same privilege.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Or any other member.
Hon. Mr. DANDURANTD: Or any other
member. That is the diffliculty.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I just want to
make a statement of fact, without entering
into a debate on the subject, because I feel
that it is entirely unfair to leave an impression on the minds of honourable gentlemen respecting so prominent a citizen of the

United States as Mr. Lewis.
My honourable friend specifically stated
that it was admitted by everybody that when
the United Mine Workers invaded this country trouble entered with them. May I state,
as a matter of fact, and as a matter of personal knowledge, that the United Mine Workers came into the coal fields in 1918 by specific
agreement with the President of the Dominion
Iron and Steel Company, who went to the
Vanderbilt Hotel in New York and met the
representative of the Mine Workers there,
and agreed that it was necessary and desirable

to bring about a more stable situation in the
coal fields of Nova Scotia, and agreed also
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

to co-operate with the United Mine Workers'
organization with the view and intention of
trying to suppress the rising tide of Bolshevism that was then sweeping over Canada.
I want to say as a statement of fact that
the United Mine Workers' organization sent
three representatives into the Province of
Alberta and maintained them there for
months, and succeeded in stopping the flow
of about $9,000 a month that was being used
for the printing and distribution of Bolshevist
propaganda in Western Canada at that time,
and very largely contributed to the discontinuance of the unsatisfactory situation that
existed there. I want to say that it is true
that the United Mine Workers' organization,
over a period of about forty years, bas never
willingly broken an agreement, and that a
man like Mr. Lewis--who in the United States
bas under bis control between one and two

million members of that organization, who
with their dependents represent half as many
people as are in the whole Dominion of Cannada, and are made up of some eighteen
nationaities, because I believe their literature
is printed in eighteen different languages-bas a tremendous task on bis hands; and that
the capacity and influence of the United Mine
Workers' organization in the United States
is one of the best guarantees that the public
bas against serious disturbances in the mining industry from time to time; and that
that control over such a cosmopolitan population, composed very largely of illiterate
men, is an influence that is wholly to the
good, a fact which, generally speaking, is

recognized by the people of the United States.
I therefore think that the words of my honourable friend, which would seem to imply
that the entrance into Canada of a citizen of
the United States of that type is not desirable,
ought to be corrected.
Let me state why I feel so strongly on the
subject. The few coal miners in the Dominion of Canada are a mere drop in the
bucket when compared with those in the
United States, and Mr. Lewis bas no particular interest, beyond bis interest in that
class of men, in the Canadian situation. Let
me refer to an analogous case on a much
smaller scale. It happens to be my humble
duty to serve a certain class of railway employees in Canada, and in addition to all
the railroads in Canada there are four rail-

way lines in the United States that corne

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Does the bonourable gentleman oocasionally cross the line?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Frequently.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then, why did

line for his health?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I did flot object.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
Nobody ever
heard me abject to b~is crossing the line.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I thought the
honourable gentleman had made a speech
oriticizing the Premier. I arn glad tbe honourable gentleman bas had an opportunity
te disprove what was stated, I think, in 'the
Gazette-that
the honourable gentleman
made a speech in Montreal reproacbing the
Prime Minister with crossing the line-at the
very time wben bis friend to bis right (Hon.
Sir James Lougbeed) was in the United
States, as was also Sir Robert Bord-en.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I did make the
remark thaýt one migbt observe that the Prime
Minister bad Ieft Canada during the budget
debate of 1924, and that the debate was
postponed for several days owing to bis absence, and that just now, wben it was going
on again, he was absent in the United States.
I did not criticize him.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
That did not
prolong tbe debate.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Wbat I wanted
te point out in this connection, wben my bon-

a'bly? I do again urge upon the Government
that it ougbt not to abandon the effort to find
some way by whicb a feeling *of confidence
might be restored and a renewal of negetiations be brougbt about.
If this deadlock continues for the next two,
or three months, tbe summer seaeon will bave
advanced, and, as Mr. Wolvin, the president,
of the Besco, very properly says, if these men
are kept out of empioyment by rmaison of
the continuation of tbis struggle for the summer montbs, afid there is very littie to do
durintr the winter because of the small production of coal, the men are going to, suifer.
Thus the resuits thdt should flow fromn tbe
good intentions and efforts cf the sympathetic
public may not be cf a.s mucb assistance as
the suffering people bave the rigbt te expeot.
It is very important, therefore, that ne time
be lest in trying te break tbe deadlock, and
starting some methed by wbich. the adjustment cf this deplerable situation may be
brought, about.
Hon. N. A. BELCOURT: Honourabie gentlemen, I bad ne intention cf taking part in

basis. It is founded on an utterly false principle, which is, that these societies, whatever
they are in the United States or in Europe,
have a right to come to Canada, and should
be welcomed here and allowed to deal with
our industrial troubles. I most strongly object
to any doctrine of that kind being preached
in Canada. I say such delegates have no
business here.
Not many years ago, while I was a member
for Ottawa in the House of Commons, a walking delegate, as I think they called him,
turned up here, and in 24 hours he had all
of the emplovees of the Printing Bureau, a
Governmont institution. out on strike, and for
three full week, that man held the Government of Canada at bay.
My honourable friend goes on. year after
year. every time ho gets an opportunity, to
suport that sort of thing. What had Mr.
Lewis to do in this country? True, my honourable friend says that he had been invited.
That may be an excuse, but not a justification. And who are those other three men
spoken of by my honourable friend, and the
other numerous walking delegates and strike
promoters, who come from the United States
to Canada? I do not care what union or what
society they belong to: not only have they
no official right or duty to be in Canada, but
I say thev have no right whatever to be
here. Their coming is purely and simply an
interference on the part of a citizen of another country in purely domestic questions in
this country. I protest, as solemnly as I can,
against that kind of doctrine being preached,
I could underespecially in this Senate.

might go out to the voters and talk to them
in that way, but I protest that such views
should not be preached, especially in this
Hfouse.
I repeat that it is absolutely wrong, absolutely unjustifiable, against the law' of
nations, and against international law, to have
this kind of agitation promoted from abroad
or actually carried on in person by the people
who preach these doctrines. and for my part
I cannot sit here quietly, but must make my
solemn protest.
I know of this very unfortunate trouble
in Nova Scotia, from what my honourable
friend and other gentlemen in the House have
stated. I deplore the situation as much as
anyone, and I, do hope that the matter will
find an adjustment at an early date. I did
not rise for the ipurpose of discussing that
situation, because as far as sympathy goes I
share entirely my honourable friend's views.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

What I dissent from mnost strongly, and what
I consider it the duty of some of us to rise
and protest against, is the preaching of such
doctrines in this House.
I crave the
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
courtesy of asking my honourable friend a
question. If a group of shareholders in any
industrial concern in this country engaged
a gentleman from the United States to operate their business and manage it, does my
honourable friend say that should not be
done?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I made an exception. I said that ipossibly in that case Mr
Lewis might have been justified, but this is
one instance out of dozens of the same kind
that I could mention where there was no invitation of any sort. My honourable friend
mentioned three genlemen who went to
Alberta, I think he sai'd, without any kind of
invitation, and without the slighteet excuse.
They went there of tdeir own free wid to do
certain things. It is against these constant
acts of interference of United Mine Workers
or other unions in the United States and Europe, that I protest. It is nothing new. I menMy honourable

The discussion concluded.
LEAGUE OF NATIONS PROTOCOL
MOTION FOR RETURN

The iSenate resumed from April 29 the adjourned debate on the motion of the Right
Hon. Sir George E. Foster:
That an humble address be presented te His
Excellency the Governor General; praying that His
Excellency will cause to be laid before the Senate a
copy of the Geneva Protocol, of the report thereon
submitted by the committees of the fifth Assembly
of the League of Nations, and of the proceedings of
the said Assembly dete.iing the discussion and action
taken in regard thereto, and copies of all correspondence between the Government of Canada and the
Governnent of Great Britain or any members thereof,
in relation thereto.

Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: lonourable gentlemen, at the outset I desire to say that in my
aippreci.ation the honourable Leader in this
House, in his address on -the 29th of April,
clearly showed that the Canadian Government
properly discharged its duty to itihe country
in refusing 'to submit tihe Protocol to Patliament for ratification. The cable of the Prime

MAY 13, 1925
Minister to the Secretary-General of the
League on the 9th of March, 1925, could not
have been better worded, and in any humble
judgment ieffit no room for dioeent. It expresses admirably the attittude whidh the
Dominion of Canada, as a member of the
League, should maintain on the question.
Firet-that Canaa should continue to give wholehearted support to the League of Nations and particularly to its work of conciliation, co-operation and
publicity.
Second-that we do not consider it in the interesta
of Canada, of the British Empire or of the League
itself to recommend to Parliament adherence to the
Protocol and particularly to its rigid provisions for
application of economic and mi1litary sanotions i
practically every future war. Among the grounds for
this conclusion is the consideration of the effect of the
non-participation of the United States upon ittempts
to enforce the sanctions and particualarly so in the
case of a contiguous country like Canada.
Third-that 'as Canada believes firmly in the eubmission of international disputes to joint inquiry or
arbitration, and has shared in certain notable undertakings in this field, we would be prepared to conaider acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the
Permanent Court in justiceable disputes with certain
reservations, and to consider methods of supplementing the provisions of the Covenant for settlement of
non-justiciable issues, including method -for joint investigation, reserving ultimate decision in domestic issues
and without undertaking further obligations to enforce
decisions in case of other states.
Fourth-that Canada wouid be prepared to take
part ta any general conference on reduction of armamenta which did not involve prior acceptance of
Protocol.

The econonic sanctions referred to, to be
effeetive, would have to be applied against
the Covenant-breaking nation, at least by all
the great Powers; otherwise, so long as the
nation against which the sanction was app'lied
could carry on commercial, relations with such
a great poweér as the United States, the blockade would lose most of its importance, and
might involve Canada and other nations of
the British Empire in serious difficulties with
the IUnited States.
In the course of the debate which took
place in England, the attitude of the Canadian
Government on the Protocol was approved by
several of the speakers, and not criticized by
any. The late Prime Minister, Mr. J. R.
MiacDonalld, after criticizing the speech of
Mr. Austen Chamberlain at Geneva, said:
"The Canadian resolution was much more
hopeful and much more helpful." The right
hon. Herbert Fisher said:
I could have wished that he (ir. Austen Chamber-

lain) lad found it possible to have adopted the
attitude which was taken by the canadian Government, which in a very shorter despatch evinced what
I regard as being a large measure of sympathy, and
showed itself willing to consider further certain aspects
cf the Protocol with a desire to .gv them due weight,
and, if possible, to ses whether any advance could
be made in the direction ôndicated. The Governnent
of Canada profemed itslf wlling to consider further

255

Clause 3 of the Protoco, under which the member
states are invited to accept the jurisdiction cf the
Permanent Court of Justice in the case of justiceable
disputes; and profesed itself wildc to consider, further, whether it was not possible to expand or to
amend the provision of the part dealing with nonjusticeable disputes.

Attempts have been made to justify the
acceptiance of the Protocol on the ground that,
by Article 10 of the Covenant, Canada has
undertaken with the other Members "to respect
and preserve as against external aggression
the territorial integrity and existing political
independence of all members of the League."
I suggest that the extent of the obligation arising from that article has been defined by all
the members of the League who, except Persia,
voted in favour of the following resolution
at the Assembly of September 25th, 1923:
The Assembiy, desirous of defining the scope of
the obligations contained in Artide 10 of the Covenant
so far as regards the points raised by the Canadian
Delégation, adopte the following resolution.
It is in conformity with the épirit cf Article 10
that, in the event of the Council considering it to
be its duty to recommend the applieation of military
mensures in consequences of an aggremion or danger,
or threat of aggression, the Councis shall be bound
to take aScount more particularly, of the geographical
situation and of the special conditions of each State.
It is for the constitutional authorities of each
member to decide in reference to the obligation oi
preserving the independence and integrity of the territory of Members, in what degree the menber is
bound to assure the execution of this obligation by
employnent of its military fores.
The recormnendation made by the Councli shall be
regarded as being of the highest importance and shal
be taken into consideration by all the members of the
League with the desire to execute engagements in
good faith.

In my opinion, the fact that the resolution
was not declared carried because of the adverse
vote of Persia, will cut no figure, and in all
cases it will be for the constitutional authorities of each member to decide whether help
shall be given, and to what extent it shall be
done. I am confirmed in this by the debate
on the Protocol in the House of Commons in
England on March 24th, 1925, when everybody seemed to agree that in case of attack
by Germany on its western front against
France, it would be the duty of England, because of its common interest with France, to
intervene and support the latter, but that England could not be expected to intervene in
cases of attack by Germany on its eastern
frontier. In the first case, Articles 42, 43 and
44 of the Treaty of Versailles, dealing
specially with the western frontier, would
be respected, but in the latter case,
Article 10 of the Covenant, although
of general application, would be ignored.
I confess my disappointment at this distinction. I would have hoped that England and
France would have stood firmly together for

256

SENATE

the enforcement of the Treaty of Versailles
and Covenant, at least as far as Europe is
concerned, where, I believe, their interests are
identical, irrespective of frontiers. If Germany
were allowed to extend its eastern frontier to
include all peoples speaking the German
tongue, as may be its ambition, it would mean,
I am afraid. the annihilation of Austria,
Poland and other newly created nations, and
make Germany so strong that France and
England could not then prevent a like extension of its western frontier. When all are
agreed that the battle of the Marne was a
miracle, in the absence of which both France
and England would have been left at the
mercy of Germany, I cannot understand that
for any consideration whatever they would
open the door to the possibility of a new
European war.
The common interest between Great Britain
and France is obvious, and seems to be admitted by everybody. Mr. Austen Chamberlain in his address on the Protocol, on the
24th of March, after referring to past wars
and t o the necessity of preventing, in his own
words, "One great military Power dominating
Europe, and at the same time dominating the
coast of the Channel and the ports of the Low
Countries," proceeds to sav:
This is an issue which affects our security. It is
an issue which we have never shirked and never can
afford to shirk.

He then gives the following text of Articles
42, 43 and 44 of the Treaty of Versailles:
42. Germany is forbidden to maintain or construet
anv fortifications either on the left bank of the
Rhine, or on the right bank to the west of a lino
drawn 50 kilometres to the east of the Rhine.
43. In the area defined above the maintenance and
assenbly of armed forces, either permanently or
temporarily, and military manoeuvres of any kind as
well as the upkeep of all permanent works for
mobilisation are, in the sane way, forbidden.
44. In case Germany violates in any manner whatever the provisions of Articles 42 and 43 she shall
be regarded as committing a hostile act against the
Powers signatory of the present Treaty and as calculated to disturb tIhe peace of the world.

He adds:
We have, therefore, a direct Treaty of obligation.
The peace of the world and the peace af the British
Empire depends upon the observance and maintenance
of that Treaty.

Faith in the Treaty of Versailes, and the
determination of Great Britain to help France
in protecting its western frontiers aga'inst
Germany, could not have been expressed in
stronger terms, and in thus speaking, Mr.
Chamberlain was no doubt expressing the
opinion of the House of Commons and of
the people in England.
So far, the execution of the Treaty of Versailles will have proved for France a most
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

cruel operation. First of all, it was in a very
large measure the making of the late Woodrow Wilson as President of the United States
and accepted by France on the assumption
of course that, the Treaty and the covenant
would be ratified by all the Allies, except
Russia, and with the promise of a tripartite
treaty between Great Britain, France and
the United States, as a guarantee that France
would not be again attacked by Germany.
Second,-the United States Congress refused
to ratify the Treaty of Versailles and the
Covenant, and because of that action on
the part of the United States, Great Britain
withdrew from the tripartite treaty. Third.
-France was strongly pressed, especially by
the United States, to attend the Disarmament
Conference at Washington, to be told there
in a rather summary way the tonnage (500,000
tons) of large warships which was considered
by Great Britain and the United States respectively as necessary for their own security,
and what tonnage she (France) would be
a'llowed (300,000 tons). I need net qualify
the proceeding, especially on the part of the
United States. Fourth-a campaign, exceedingly well organized the world over, against
the so-called French militarism was used
against France for the purpose of forcing upon
her repeated large concessions as regards
reparations indemnities. Fifth,-Germany received throughout from some of the Allies
a moral support which made it possible to
organize and effect its fraudulent bankruptcy.
Sixth,-Deprived as she was of the support
of both Great Britain and the United States
and threatened to be left standing isolated
in face of a powerful Germany entirely freed
of all exterior and domestie debts, France
felt the necessity of making for its own protection defensive treaties with Poland and
Czecho-Slovakia, both members of the League
of Nations, whose territorial integrity and
political independance are under the protection
of the League; which treaties she is now
called upon to denonuce if she is ta obtain
a treaty of alliance with Great Britain against
atacks fron Germany on its western frontier.
Leaving Poland and Czecho-Slovakia at the
mercy of Germany would be, on the part
of France, a disgraceful action, which I am
sure she will not do, and it would but encourage Germany to disregard the Treaty of
Versailles.
I am satisfied that France has but one
ambition, that of doing all in its power to
insure the peace of Europe, which implies
its own security, and I have too much faith
in the fairness and sound judgment of the
English people to think that they will net

CANTEEN FUNDS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 32, an Act respecting the disposai of the Canteen Funds.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, it will be
remembered that this Bill was before the
Senate last Session. Perhaps the memory of
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

my colleagues is better than my own. I do
not remember whether we postponed the
whole Bill or amended it, or whether amendments made by us were not concurred in.
However, it does not matter. The same Bill,
practicai]y, is before us this Session. I know
of few changes that have been made. There
is provision for the Yukon Territory which
may not have been in the last Bill. At any
rate, we wiil examine the proposed measure
minutely when it comes before the Committee. It may be well that the Senate should
hear the official statement as to the Canteen
Fund, which is to be found, in the preamble
of the Bill:
Whereas certain profits have accumulated from the
operation of canteens during the late war and from
other sources; and wheress more particularly these
profits represent (i) the share allotted to the Canadian
Expeditionary Force of the profits made by the operation of canteens under the control of the British War
Office, (fi) the profits made by the operation of
canteena under the control of various units of the
Canadian Expeditionary Force overseas, (iii) the share
of profits alfotted to the Government of Canada for
division among Canadian war charities byr the War
Office Cinematograph Committee arising fron the profits made by such Comnittee from the exhibition
of pictures taken in the ares of active operations,
(iv) the share allotted to the Royal Canadian Navy
by the Admiralty; and whereas, there is now in the
hands of the Receiver-General for Canada the sum of
$2,350,000 more or less. representing the said allottments and profits together with interest thereon; and
whereas through the intervention of His Excellency
the Governor General a special allotment of £5,000 bas
been made by the Council of Management of the
United Services Fund from the share of the Canteen
Funds alfocated to the United Kingdom, for the
benefit of ex-Imperial soldiers and their families
resident in Canada with a request that it be administered as it may be determined by the Government
of Canada; and whereas it is desirable that distribution of these amounts be made so that ex-members
of the forces and tiheir dependents may benefit
thereby-

No satisfactory scheme was found for the
distribution of these funds to the returned
soldiers. If I am not mistaken, a poli or
referendum was had, but the answers were
so unsatisfactory that the Government remained without any mandate.
It is now proposed to establish a central
Board of Trustees, and to divide practically
the whole amount in proportion to population,
to be administered and distributed by provincial Boards of Trustees. This, in the large,
is the scheme. I will not go more minutely
into the details of the Bill, because it would
practically involve the reading of ail the
I desire simply to say, in order that
clauses.
the Senate may at this stage know exactly the
situation, how the Canteen Fund has been
administered since it crossed the Atlantic and
reached the Federal treasury.
The present Government has not disposed
of any moneys belonging to this Fund since

M AY 14, 1925
it was sworn in, that is, the 29th December,
1921. This Fund remains to-day what it was
at that date plus the accumulation of interest.
It is in the hands of the Receiver General.
The moneys paid out of the Canteen Fund
were so paid 'by the former Administration hy
Orders-in-Council dated, respectively: July,
1921, 850,000; Septemiber, 1921, $20,000; September, 1921, $12,500; October l7th, 1921,
$120,000, making a total of 8202,M00.
An
amount of 84,175.10 was flot expended; so that
the total of moneys paid out and expended
under the aboya Orders in Council was $198,324.90.
These amounts were pyaid to various
soldiers' organizations throughout the country.
There was a reference to the Disabiement
Fond, and I stated thae I would t-ry to obtain
some information to lay before the Senate.
These matters will ail be ventilated in the
Committee, but 1 think I should 'ba allowed
to make the following statement concarning
tho Disablement Fund.
This Fund was flot
contributed by the returned men.
It was
ongmialîy eol'lected for the purpose of buying
machine guns.
Later, as the Governmient
undentook this service, the money was left in
the hands of the trustee by the Minister of
National Dafance, pending a decision as to
what could ba done with it in the interest of
the returned men. A report which was made
by the trustee, Mr. E. H. Scammell, under
date of March 7th., 1925, relates the complete
history od the Disablement Fund.
The principle of ýadvancing seime ýmoney for
the, maintenance of an Adjustment Bureau in
Ottawa was recognized by the House of Co-mmons in 1923, when an appropriation in the
Supplementary Estimates was voted for the
r'artýal refunding of expenses incurred by
soldiers' organizations in the dîischarge of
such duties as adjustment of daims. Out
of that appropriation $5,000 was paid back
to the Disablement Fund at that time, to
cover a loan of the saine amounit made to the
G.W.V.A. some weeks earlier. As to 1924
and 192, three boans were made by the
trustee, Mr. Scammeli, to the G.W.V.A. or
to the Dominion Veterans' Alliance, of $5,00
each, for the saine purpose, out of the Disablement Fund. The principal contributor
to the Disablement Fond was Mr. James
Carruthers of Montreal.
Correspondence whicha was laid on the table
of the House of Commons during Maroh last,
exchanged between the Minister of S.C.R.
and Sir Arthur Cornie, discloses that Sir
Arthur Currie had consulted wîth Mn. James
Carruthers on the subi ect of advancing some
money from the Disablement Fond for the
maintenance of an Adjustment Bureau. Sir
Arthur Cornie, in a latter addressed to the
S-17J

259

Prime Ministen onder date of May 7, 1923,
conveys the complete assent of Mr. James
Carruthers to the money of the Disablement
Fund being used for the maintenance of an
Adi ostment Bureau.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBAC1{:
May I ask
whether that latter is on 'file, and 'brooght
down in reply to my reqoest?
Hon. Mn. DANDIJRAND: I do not know
whether it was asked for by the honouasble
gentleman, but I think I have onder my hand
copies of that correspondence. I need not
file it here, but I will put it in the hands of
the honourable gentleman, or produce it at
the first meeting of the Committea.
Accordingly, three payments of $5,000 were
made--the flrst to the G.W.V.A., and the two
last to the Dominion Veterans' Alliance. The
Minister's intention was that these payments
should be made to the Dominion Veterans'
Alliance. The Order in Counicil relating to
this loan of $15,000 was passed aften the finst
payment was made, the Minister at that
time being unaware that the first payment
had ibeen made to the G.W.V.A. As will be
seen in the Memorandum made by the
Trustee, Mr. E. H. Sca.mmell, the latter considered that hae was flot exceeding bis rights
as Trustee in issuing the boan.
Sir Arthur Currie bas, on three different
occasions, in correspondance which has been
laid on the Table of the House of Comýmons,
reýpresented to the Govero-ment the importance of maintaining the Adi ustment
Bureau. The moneys from the Disablement
Fond,' without any boan provision for repayment could have -been placed 'by Order in
Cooncil at the disposal of an Adi ostment
Bureau. The provision made in the Order
in 'Council is only with the object of securing
a repayment of those moneys advanced by
the trustee, on account of a practîce which
had been established by the truetee; and it
was reprasanted that, as the Canteen Fonds
Bill-not rejected, but delayed iby the Senate
-made provision for the setting aside of
$100,000 to maintain an AdiustmIent Bureau.
and the Trustees in charge of that amoont
of money would ba nequested to reimburse
the Disablexnent Fond Trustee.
I th-ink it opportune to make this statement, but of course all these matters will ha
axaminad into before the Comujittea.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill -was

Hon. Mr. BAN]YURAND:
Ais we have

to a Special Committee, I would move that
this Bill be referred to the same Committee.
Before the
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
motion is put, I think it desirable that a statement should follow the one just made by
the leader of the Government with respect
to these two funds. The essential point of
difference between these funds is that the
Canteen Fund comes to Canada from the
Canteen Board in England, and the Government of Canada are the trustees of that fund,
without a trust beyond the fact that the money
was contributed to by Canadian soldiers and
belongs te Canadian soldiers. On the other
band. the Disablement Fund was primarily
contributed by Mr. Carruthers to a certain
amount, supplemented by contributions from
a large number of people all over Canada, and
the Government appointed Mr. Scammell to
be the trustee of that fund; so here you have
a fund with a trustee-an individual.
Is the honHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ourable gentleman very sure that it was the
Government which appointed Mr. Scammell
as the trustee? Was it not Mr. Carruthers
himself?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The Minister of
that day appointed him-and lie was the Government in the premises. So you have a fund
contributed by a number of persons, and you
have a trustee. The nature of the trust, in
the absence of a formal document, must
necessarily be drawn lfrom the correspondence
passing between all parties. That, for a time,
did constitute the trust, I submit, until the
trustee himself prepared a memorandum setting out the nature of the trust, and submitted that in a circular-letter to all contributors. Thereupon the trust became more or
less fixed; and the trust provides that this
money shall be used for disabled soldiers.
With respect te the Canteen Fund, the
Government itself is the trustee without a
trust document. The Government of 1921
was certainly not at :fault; they did not do
anything wrong in advancing these sums of
money to whomsoever they saw fit. My complaint is that the persons who got the money
did net spend it as the Government thought
they were going to spend it; and that will be
the subject of the inquiry.
With respect to the Disablement Fund, the
situation is otherwise. There you have a trust
and a trust document, and according to that
document the money in the hands of the trustee is to be used for the benefit of disabled
men; and I submit that the Government had
no right to procure the trustee-for that is
what it amounts to-to make a loan not in
accordance with the trust.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

lion. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
gentleman has not failed to notice that the
Government declares that the trustee was
the sole judge as to the propriety of making
that advance of $15,000, and that it intervened solely for the purpose of seeing to
the reimbursement of that fund from moneys
that really belonged to the soldiers, that is,
the Canteen Fund.
It will be for the Committee to pass upon
ihat contention, and te see to what extent
the Government was right in expecting that
it would be supported by Parliament in the
reimbursement of the Disablement Fund by
that $15,000. So far it has had the endorsation of the House of Commons, and the
matter is now before the Senate.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The honourable
leader's present statement is scarcely in accordance with the answers laid upon the
Table previously-that the trustee himself
desired to make this loan in the particular
way in which it was made. However, as the
honourable gentleman says, the whole matter
will be discussed before the Committee, and
then we shall all know wchere we are.
The motion referring the Bill to the Special
Committee aforesaid was agreed to.
PUBLIC SERVICE REARRANGEMENTS
AND TRANSFERS BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 43, an Act to amend the Act
to authorize Rearrangements and Transfers
of Duties in the Public Service.
He said: This Bill is of very small importance, but it is suggested by the Statute
Revision Commission that it should be introduced. In some of the departmental Acts,
as, for example, the Department of Agriculture Act, R.S., chapter 67, where transfer of
duties is specially authorized, there is a clause
corresponding to the one introduced by this
Bill for substituting the Minister and officials
of the department to which the transfer is
madle for the Minister and officials of the
transferring department, and to avoid duplication and for the quieting of any doubts as
to such substitutions in the case of the departments net specially provided for, it is
suggested on behalf of the Statute Revision
Commission that the provision for substitution should be made general by incorporating
it in the general Act. So the following section is introduced:
Whenever
any other
f unction, or
the publaic

under the provisions of this Act, or under
lawful authority, any power, duty or
the control or supervision of any part cf
service is transferred from one Minister

MAY 14, 1925
of the Cniwn to any other Maister of the Crown,
or froen one deparbment or boanch af the pubdie

publie service, the Mlinister, depeartmmet or branei to
-hich the poewer, duty, fu*WUgn, eontrai or supe.rvision la treingerreti, andti he soerçpciate affiere of

departmient or brand froin which Vthe power, duty,
funation, contrait or supervisilon is go tmeefarrd as
aforesaiti.

This means that if one branch or department is transferred to another, the staff of
that branch or department w'ill conne undier
the jurjsdictjan and control of the head of
the Department to which it has been transferred.
The motion wa.s agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

MIGRATORY BIRDS CONVENTION B3ILL

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committea on Bill 44, an Act
to amend the Migratory Birds Convention
Act.

Sections 1 and 2 were agreed to.
On section 3--no one to buy, salI, or possess

Hon. Mr. GR1IESBAOH: May I ask the
Leader of the Government a question? My
recollaction is that when the Migratory Birds
Convention Act was first brought in, the
statement was made ta the Housa that it was
based upon same treaty wi'th the United States
as to treatment of the sama birds when in
that part of thse woeld. 1 was wondening
wbether my recoIlection is correct or flot,
and whether the Leader of thse Government
couqd tell me wbat action was takan by the
United States--if the UJnited States can ïake
action-to protect these birds, after we have
protected them, or whether, after we have
protected them. and grown them, the sportsmen down there have the benelit of this. I
should like to have iny memory refresbed on
that point.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I have not the
information at hand, but I will procure it
bef are thse third reading.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: 1 do not care
ta hold up tise proceedings at this stage, but
I may say that many sportsmen in aur country
feel that we grow these birds and praserve
them for the southern sportsmen ta kill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 suppose that
when these birds migrate te the soutb they
do like many other Canadian emigrants, and
retura with their increasad ïfamilies.

CHANGING
TUE CANADIAN
CONSTITUTION
PROPOSED RESOLUTION

The Senate resumed from April 29 the debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. Turgeon:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, it is inezpedient that any change take place in the Constitution of Canada as established by the British North
Anierica Act and amendments thereto, as set forth in
the Speech from the Throne at the opening of the
present session of Parliament, without the unanimous
consent of the Provinces affected by such change to be
expressed by the Legislatures of the respective Provinces.

Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen,
I think I can promise you that my remarks
on this matter will not be very long. I do
not intend to traverse the ground that was
se well covered by the two members who
have already spoken on this question. Both
the mover (Hon. Mr. Turgeon) and the lionourable member from Granville (Hon. Mr.
Chapais), in the speeches they have made,
have shown, I think, a great deal of industry.
The speech of the honourable member from
Granville must have involved an immense
amount of labour, and it will always be, I
think, a valuable record of this House.
I do not think Le at all exaggerated the
work done by this House; if anything, Le
erred on the other side. There are perhaps
one or two things that have been well done
by the Senate that I do not think Le mentioned-he probably was not in the House
at the time. If you go over the work of this
House from time to time and check up the
work donc by its honourable members, I
think you will find that it has nothing to be
ashamed of in the part that it has taken in
the legislation of Canada.
I understand that the honourable gentlemari from Granville first makes the point
that we have done important work, and,
secondly, that the existence of the Canadian
Senate is a part of the Convention or Treaty
which is embodied in the -British North
America Act. He refers us back to what took
place at what is called the Quebec Convention. That I have been over before in a
Committee of this House. Some reference
made to the speeches and resolutions that
were pazsed at that Convention, and I am
quite certain that the honourable member is
quite correct in his allegations of what took
place at that Convention, and that the existence of a nominated Senate representing the
different Provinces was a sine qua non of
Confederation-that if that principle had not
been accepted there would have been no Confederation; and that, if that Treaty is to be
changed to-day without the consent of every
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

Province that was then a party to it, Confederation would necessarily go with it. You
inay say: " Let it go at that. If you have a
gathering of the different Provinces who consent to this matter, it is for them to say; if
there is one Province that stands out against
a change, the thing would be a nu'lity."
From one point of view I would be content
to leave the thing at that and to await the
doings of the proposed conference, which
seems to be a sort of masterly retreat from a
bold declaration of war that was made on
the prairies with regard to this House. I say
I would be almost content to leave it au
that; but there are one or two points in recard to this House that I think it would be
well to refer to. Because there are two things
that may happen--either you may have this
louse abolished altogether, or you may have
its powers modified.
It is important to see just what part this
House plays in the legislation of this country,
not only from the point of view referred to
by the honourable member from Granville,
in amending legislation, but in blocking or
determining legislation that might be carried
by a single unchecked House, and that migI t
be disastrous to this country.
I wi'l refer very shortly to the history of
three single chambers, and I think I will make
it pretty clear just what might happen, and
almost necessarily would happen in Canada
if the Senate were abolished. If you look at
the constitutions in the United States, you
finid that the National Government consists
of two houses and a President, with a written
constitution. The President has a veto, which
is liable to be overridden by a two-thirds vote
of the houses; but if they travel outside the
Constitution, the Supreme Court of the United
States puts them right. That is the way the
matter stands in the National Government.
When you go to the State Governments, you
find that without exception they have two
houses and a Governor, and the situation is
temipered by a clause in the National Constitution that a State Legislature cannot
interfere with a contract. Any attempt on
the part of a State Legislature to violate a
contract or wipe it out of existence would be
deciared unconstitutional by the Supreme
Court of the United States. That is an important thing to remember. Besides that, the
Governor-of the State of New York, for
instance-has thirty days in which he may
veto any Act that has been passed by the
Legislature. From that you will see the
way in which legislation is surrounded in the
United States, and that they are thoroughly
conservative in that respect. They have tried

state of .4aî4rs to have in any Anglo-Saxqn
pountry a form of governinent that could
supersede the courts. There would be liberty
to no one, 4pd qpprsipn chiefly of the poor.
But there is nqw apoîher single rhamber.
Tt is Qstting in M.Qsuqw. Arnqng othrr things,
the Soviets haye managed to murder their
SQyereign and his farnuly, te repudiate thp
national debt, to criish and, so far as they
cari, to annihilate the Church, and to violate
every title-d.eed to property in Russia, paying
go attpntion at ail to contraets. They have
gone frqm one thing tg another. One of the
latest aceempnýs of their Legisiature, as
related by a Labour delegation that went
from Englalnd to Russia and was, if anything,
quite fripndiy to the Russians, has been to
pass legisiation regulating birth control and
te makp claborate provision for a state hospital
to give women abortion when they go there
to get it.
Su'cl is the record of the single chamber,
and I submit to you that an ounce of experience is worth a pound of theory. You may
have as mueha theory as you like about First
anti Second Chambers, but if down a long
period of bis tory you find that Single
Chambers have been tried and have broken
down, yop~ must conclude that they have
inherent defeçts.
This is a matter to which 1 have given
a great dia] of attention. I have tried on
this occaion to curtail my remarks. Some
years agri 1 wrote a short article about the
Single Chamber Goverrments in France and
in. Engl4nd, wliich was pubiished in Volume
XXXIX of the Ganadian Law Times, 1919,
and, in order to sum up what I have to say,
T want to reati from a paragraph of that
article. Wbat I say there is this:

lçnows the history of either the Egglish or

Constitution asi it goes along. And it tries
its own ýmembers. It determines who may

and who was not elected. That was the
charge made against the Single Chanmber by
Cromwell in Englanti, and it is incontrovertibl'e that it was truc; and it was true in

The second weakneffs 1 mention in this

Third, there is a disregard of the rights of
property and coitracts. We need net dweli
qn that. F.verygne knows that it is truc.
Arnther weakness is: "usurping the rights

A fu'rther weakpess is the injustice to
minorities . The mai ority in a Singie Chamber will do as it likes, totally disregarding
the minority.
There is the further weakness of continuous
orude legislation.
Furthecire, the Single Chamber has this
weakness, that it is liable to be mobbed. In
Paris the Lcgislature wae nobhed continually.
Mobbing the Nationial Convention was a
science. There was a ilittle of that sort of
tbing aleo in Londoni, 141t, in Engianti there
was a etrong muan, in the person of Cromwell,
to ptit the mQb where it belongeti. There
may lie excitement inside as weil as outside
the Legislature. Wlien 300 men are gatlicred

under the excitement th4t arises, not outside.
but in the Ilouse itself. The measures they
pass bccotne law immediateiy, and there is
no check andt no way to avcrt what may be
national disaster.
It is worth whie watching wbat is happening in the Canadian provinces that bave
abolisheti their second bouse. The dlate Mr.
Whitney is authority for the statement, which
I had from thc late Mr. Lasli, that from the
point of view of the public intcrcst in Ontario the worst thing ever donc by the Legislature of that ]province was the abolition of
the Legisiative Council; and I tbink that
,jnybody who watches what is going on in
Ontario will probably agree with that statewcent. Tliey have already taken cases out
of the courts andi settleti them in the Legislattire. You bave this rcmarkable situation,
that in thc Imperial Parifiament there is a Bill
to abolish wliat is known as the fiat of the
Attorney General. If you want to sue the
Crowg you mnust übtain leave from the

Crown who thinks 4p ha4 a grievance. Conversely, the Crown can sue the indiyidual.
But here is the curious thing: that when this
work of royalty, of what waa thought at one
tirne ta be tyrjiny, is oni the eve of being
abolished in England, it i;s reyived here in
QntArio, with its Single Çhamber. 1n the

is that, in Englapcl thora is a rnove to abolish

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: 1 was wondering
what my honourable friend meant by saying
that the situation in Ontario was an instance
of a retrograda step by a Single Chatnber.

at ail. Here we have two flouses of l>arlia-

sue4ki.pg now with regard ta fists.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: Oh, yes, with regard to
fiats.
The man on the street would tell
you that the fiat is a work of tyranny. We
inherited it, but the Ontario Legisiature has
created, it. That is the difference between the
two situations, and what I was trying ta point
out was that this gingle Chamber, which. has
been working only for a short time, bas already
exhibited the weaknesses of the Single
Chambeç in England and some of those in
Russia.
That is practically ail I bave to say on this
matter. Wheni you corne to deal with the
question before a convention, it is well to
know just what is the effect of either the
abolition or the nmodificatiq4 qf the powers
of the Senate. A gjingle O0ha mber in England,
with a suspensory veto on the part of the
Protertqr, wqs as bad a failure as you would

my honourable friend to a situation which bas
arisen between, 1 may say, the ýCommons

to the Clerk of the Shipping Combine Committee which is now sitting, for a copy ol
the evidence taken before that Commîttee,
which has been printed and, I understand,
circulated amongst members of the Commons
and also amongst members of the Press

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No; 'by
his superior officers-I cannot say how far it
wiil go.
Hon. Mr. BEICOURT: I think it is very
important for us to know on whose instructions this Clerk is acting.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think
this Chamber should ask His Honour the
Speaker to make inquiry into the subject and
a scerta in, if authority bas been given to this
Clerk to refuse parliamentary papers to which
we are quite as much entitled as the members of the House of Commons. If such
authority ha.s been given, a misunderstanding
wiIl be created which. will not conduce to the
harmony of the two Chambers. I simp]y
direct the attention of my honourable friend
to this anomalous condition and hope that
he will make inquiry into it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I intended asking
the same question as the honourable the
senior memnber for Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) has asked: how far is the information
that my honourable friend bas obtained the
officiai answer of the authorities of the House
of Commons?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Mr. Davidson, I understand, received -his instructions
from Mr. Todd, and Mr. Todd received. h~i
instructions from -the C'lerk of the Hlouse. 'Me
Clerk of the House apiparently is entering upon
a new policy, to be rnarked with economy of
expenditure in the printing of Parliament;proba!bly with the intention that we shou'ld do
our own printing.
Hon. Mr. DANDUTtAND: That would be a
very regrettîcble procedure. If that were the
stand of the House of Cormons-and I cannot
for one moment entertain the idea-it would
simply mean that if we deemed. it necessary
we would atart the whole inquiry over again
for our own 'benefit. If there is an inquiry
going on with regard to a piublic Bâ1l which is
to be examined by this Chamber, it goes without saying that we are entiitled. to as much
light as the other Chamiber. I join with My
honourable friend in tihe suggeotion-because I
believe it is the best procedure- that His
Honour the Speaker obtain the .prQper information on this matter. I have no doubt that
this is thetbest way to obtain it, inasmueh as
it is not a Government matter, but a question
rélating to the privileges of the Bouse of
Commons. 0f cour-se, the Bouse of Commons

may decide to confine the distribution of
printed copies of the report.of any Comnmittee
to irts own members, but in that event the
Senate wouqd have to determine what woù.qd
be best for it to do iwhen the same measure
came before thtis Chamber for review.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: Honourab1le gentlemen,
I think that if I asked an officer in charge of
documents, in either House of Paiqiament, and
got ta refu-sa)l, I would 'be entitfled to assume
that he hati authority for what fie was doing,
and that the Government of the day was responsible.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is this the action of the Government, or is it the action of
the House of Commons?
Hon. Mr. ROSS: It is flot for the man requesting these documents to hcbd a conioner's
inque.st to deterxnine whether or not the officiai1 had authorîty to do what he did. The
member is entitled to assume that it is the sut
of the Government, and the instruction of the
Government, until we have a repudiation of it
on the partof the Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am not ready
to admit that, because the officiail rnay be an
officiail of the Hlous of Commons, and not of
the Government.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Take it either way. The
thing bas two heads instead of only one, that
is ail: either the House of Commons is responsibie or the Government is responsible. *But
whien I ask for a copy of this evidence, I do
not think that I am to he driven from the
busc of Commons to the Government and
from the Government back to the House of
Commons. I am entitled to assume that I
have a grievance, and it i.s for the Government of the day to remove that grievance.
Hon. Mr. DA-NUR.AND:
I have no
objection to assuming my share of responsibility when I feel that I have responsibility,
but I would suspend that judgmentHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
May I
take issue with the observation made by my
honourable friend. that the Commons would
have the right to determine the practice as
to the distribution of the printing of Parliament? I take issue with that statement because, as I understand it, the vote is for the
printing of Parliament, and the Joint Committee on Printing determines what measure
of printing shall be done, how it shall be
distributed, and so on.
Hon. Mr. BELCOIJRT:
I thoroughly
agree with my leader. That is a matter
within the jurisdiction of the Houas of Com-

268

SENATE

mons. Tt may be that the Goverument of
the day does exercise more Gr less influence
upon the House, but the ultimate responsibility for an act of this kind rests upon the
Bouse of Commons, nlot upon the Government. It is the Bouse of Commons that
votes the suppiy: it is nlot the Government
of the day that is responsible. Ultimately the
responsibility is that of the House-I care
flot what share the Government takes in inducing the Bouse ta take that attitude.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGBEED:
But ail
supply must originate with the Governinent.
Hon. Mr. BELCOU.RT: Not necessarily. It
may originate with the Bouse.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Not at ail.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGBEED: No private
member could bring it down.
lion. Mr. BELCOURT: It could corne by
the recommendation of a Committee.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: There would have to
be a recommendation from the Governor
Generai.
Bon. Mr. DAINTDUBAND: No. My honourable friend himself could move that a
Committee of the Senate be authorized to
eall for papers and persons and to take
evidence. That implies the expenditure of
money. It does not start with a resolutiori
reeommended by the Governor General.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The constitutional
theory and .constitutionaI effeet is that the
Government is merely a committee of the
Bouse of Commons and responsible to the
House of ýCommons. That ýcannot be diýputed:
that is the Iaw. Under the British syitem the
Cabinet of the day is imerely a committee of
the Bouse of Commons, responsible to the
Bouise of Commons and kept there or puit out
by the vote of the Bouse of Commons, and I
maintain that the Teponsibigity for the printing of Paffliament or the distrilbution of Acts,
or the procedure of Parliament, is entirëly
under the ýcontrol of Parliament, and net the
Government at a,1l. and that if Parliament
chooses to do anything in the matter it must
take the responsibility.
HLon. Mr. DANDURAND: At ail events,
we wiil have more Iight when Bis Honour the
Speaker, if he does not obi oct Vo acceptiug tJ"e
mandate, has gone into the situation.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER: Is
he to beard the Government in the Privy Counci,! Chamber. or is he to beard the Bouse of
Commons in the Bouse of Commons Chamber? When he starts out on his mission,
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

whithsr is fie bound? Tt seems to me that the
Speaker might italk Vhe ýmatter over with the
Speaker of the Houise of Commons and find
out wbere the difficulty is.
But what a stup~id .proceeding àt aqI sceins
to be. A Governmen't BfiU eûmes before the
other Bouse and, aliter discussion, is referred
Vo a committes. The ýGoveroment lias flot
iight enough to know whait to do about iýt,and
is anxiouis Vtobe informed. So ià instructs a
committee of the Bouse of Com.mons to
gather ail Vhs information 'posible. We sit
here, and we are ta have a review; we need
the information just ias much as the members
of the Bouse of Commons. A stupid kind of
thing it is to prevent us gebting that information a littie hefore Vhs measurs is brought
down to us.
There may be another rendering of the
Prime Miniieter's aippqica'tion of the word
"~hostile" to this body. I do flot know how lhe
spslled it, but it .might be very apuiliicable if it
was eîpellled h-o-s-4-e-l, benause this body dos
act in a nursery oapacity to everytbing that
cornes up from. the Hous of Commons.
Bon. W. B. ROSS- I wish Vo eall attention
Vo Section 54 of the British North America
Act, whicda fuiily justifies my contention:
It shall not be lawful for the Bouse of Commons to
adopt or pass any vote, resolution, address or Bill
for the appropriation of any part of the publie revenue
or of any tax or intpost, to any purpose that bas flot
been first recommended to that Hue, bt muessage of
the Governor General in the Session in which such
vote, resohution, address or Bill is proposed.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do nlot dispute
that.
Bon. W. B. ROSS: Then, what is the use
of saying the Bouse of Commons can incur
expenditure without authority?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Just as we do
it.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: You do it first, and by
some kind of pious fraud the address is got
afterwards.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: 1 was addressing
myseif ta the refusai given by an officer of
Vhs Bouse of Commons ta distributs a certain
document. My remarks were intendsd to be
confined ta that act, flot ta the act of voting
the money or voting supply. WhaV I mean
is that if an order of that kind bas been
given by tbe Clerk of the Bouse or by the
Bouse itself, Vhs Bouse bas ta take the responsibility. no matter at whose instance it is
done. Assuming that the Govsrnment bas
induced the clerk or the chaîrman of a committee toacnt accordingiy, the responsibilitv
rests upon the Commons and Vhe Commonà
only.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourabie
gentlemen, for the information of the flouse
I may cail attention to the fact that for nomes
reason or other the Clerk of the Senate has
been more favoured than the honourable meinbers of this flouse, because lie has had copies
of this evidence sent to his office regularly
ever since the Committee started its work. I
have in my hand the second number of the
proceedings of the ýCommittee, and on page
4 1 find the following:
Ordered, that the said Commitee be authorized to
have their minutes and proceedings printed f rom day
to day for the use of members of the Committee,
and that rule 74 be suspended in reference thereto.

Honourable gentlemen will remember that
rule 74 of the flouse of Commons deais with
the printing of documents, and reads as
follows:
On motion for printing any paper being offered, the
same shall be first submnitted to the Joint Committee on
Printing for report, before the question is put thereon.

The suspension of that mile enables the
Committee to print the evidence withoiit
bringing it before the Printing Committee.
I understand that the cost is paid out of
printing funds, and is charged to the expenses
of the flouses of Parliament. It is quite
evident that ail members of Parliament are
entitled to get this evidence. But I wiil take
the matter up with the Speaker of the House
of Commons a.8 soon as possible.
Hon. Mr. DANDURA,%ýD: After hearing
that statement, 1 wonder whether the order
of the Contmittee is that distribution be
macle simpiy t<> members of the Committee?
If so, two-thirde or more of the membera
of thie Nouse of Commons are left out. However, His Honour the 8peaker will invegtigate.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: May I add just~a,
word? At noon, as I was coming past the
post office, the Chairman of Ibis Committee,
Mr. MeMaster, eame long. 1 said: "How is
it we cannot get any copies of the evidence
of your Commrittee?" nle Ioôked aI me and
said, "Why, don't you gel them?" I sàid,
"No, I have just beeu askiiig at the post
office whether they got any for distribution."
Hie turned to the post office and asked, and
they told himi they had none, and hie said te
me, "<I wil lookr into tfisg." Sé evidently lie
does not knôw anything about the situation.

Migratory Birds Convention Act is the
enahling Act to put in operation the Migratory Birds Convention, a 1'reaty between
Great Bx'itaiii and t1te United Stateg, fori the
protection of the migratory' birds of Canada
and the United States.
Foiiowing the ratifiéation of Ibis Convention the United States passed an Act entitled
the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, a eopy of
which i-8 at the disposai of the honourabie
gebtlemnan,
and under
this Act
the
United States authorities adopted regulations as marked in the attached consolidation.
The United States authorities have been active in enforcing this
Act and the regulations thereunder. Both the
Act and the regalationo conformi fully wîth
the Treaty and put it ln fore. Cl ose contact la maintained between the 'United States
officiais and the officials of the Department
concerned in the administration o! the Migratory Bird Act in Canada, and the United

fuily informed concerifing the measures that
have beeu taken lor enfôteruht of the
Treaty ini the United States and cencerning

The Stportsmen of the United States have

BANKRUPTCY BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill Z3, an Act to amend the
Bankruptcy Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the working
of the Bankruptcy Act occasionally discloses
some weak points which need to be amended.
This Bill covers quite a number of questions,
some of minor importance, and mostly of
administration. There is one matter of some
moment to the farming community. I will not
go into an explanation of the various clauses
just now, as we can do so more satisfactorily
in committee, but will content myself with
moving the second reading of the Bill and
suggesting that the members of the legal
fraternity and others who are interested in the
Act should take the week-end to examine the
clauses which I will move before the Committee on Monday evening.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Would
my honourable friend, before the second
reading to the Bill, state the general policy of
the amendments? The Bill is not on my file,
and I was anxious to look over it. Do the
amendments depart in any important way
from the general policy of the Act as we
have it to-day? We have made so many
amendments to the Bankruptcy Act from time
to time that it is difficult to say just what
the law is now. Many of those departures
have been on questions of policy. I observe
by the draft, that some new provisions have
been introduced of a rather radical character,
particularly dealing with farmers.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I mentioned the
fact that there was a clause concerning the
farmers, which I can explain to my honourable
friend.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Something
entirely new, is it not?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It bears on the
fact that farmers generally cannot comply
with the Act, because in most cases they do
not keep books. To meet that situation there
is a clause which specially concerns them.
Subsection 5 of section 58 provides that the
Court shall refuse or suspend a discharge if
any of the facts mentioned in section 59 are
proved against the insolvent. The facts
mentioned in paragraphs b and c of section
59 are that the insolvent has omitted to keep
books of account, and that he has continued
to trade after knowing himself to be insolvent.
It is represented that in the case of an insolvent farmer the proof of those two facts
should not disentitle him to a discharge, because few farmers keep books, and a bad crop
may render a farmer insolvent, yet he cannot
discontinue farming; he must keep on working
his farm.
Hon. Mr. STANDFIELD: How could a
farmer make an Income Tax return if be did
not keep books?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: He does not make
them.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I can quite
easily sec that many of them have not to
make return.s because of their rather smali
revenue, which entitles them to the greater
consideration, if possible, because it shows that
the returns from the very hard work that
they put in are not as considerable as those
from other callings in which the work is not
so heavy.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My memory may
be at fault, but I thought that last year we
amended the Bankruptcy Act so as to exempt
the farmer.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: As to the
province of Quebec.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend wi'l see that the two reasons which
would disenititle a farmer to his discharge, as
they stand against him in the present Act, are
reasons whidh in many instanices could not
apply against himi. One is that he has not
kept books. Well, most farmers do not see
the great imiportance of keelping books. The
second is that he has continued to trade after
knowing himself to be insolvent. Wdll'l, no one
would re.proach a farmer who was in a oondi-

MAY 15, 1iRi)
tion of insolvency for -trying to eke out hie
living by continuing the operation. of hie farm.
This is one of the principal amenKdmentis to
the Aot. The others are matters of administration, which we willl go into at the next sitting
of tihe House ini Cournitee of the Whole.
Hon. Sir JAME1S ILOUGHEED: I suppose
the terra "farmer" will include the, Pro~gressive?
Hon. ,Mr. BELCOUIRT: It may be necessary
to distinguish, though.
Hon.,Mr. BRADBURY: They are miners, or
grain buyers.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Progressive
should not be inisolvent, 'because 'he would be
alert and go forward.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: He may
be progressive in that direction.
The motion was agreed to, and rbhe Bill was

Bill 26, an Act respecting a Patent of
Walter W. Williams.-Hon. G. V. White.
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED PO-LCE
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon..Mr. DANDURAND .moved the seoond
reading of Bill 115, an Act to amend the Royat
Canadian M-ounted Police Act.
He said: This Bill contains but one section,
which amcnds tihe Royal Canadian. Mounted
Police Act, chapter 91 of the Revised Statutes
of 1906. Lt is as fdllows:
Pensions to oficers, their widows, and constables
granted prior to the seventh day of July, one thousand
nine hundred and nineteen, shall be readjusted i
accordance with the rates of psy for officers and
constables provided by the said Royal Canadien
Mounted Police Act as amended prior to and on the
seventh day of July, one thousand nine hundred and
nineteen, but no such readjustment ehali authorize the
mecrease of any paymnents for pensions that acerued
before the passing of this Section.

T1here has been a constant and pressing request made to the Grovernment for a number
of years for attention to be given to ihe case
of tihe oLd .members of the Royat Mounted
Police who were retired on a vezy ent scale
of pensions prior to 1919. They rendered very
effective service to, the country, and witih the
increased cost of living iiheY are ini a staite
bordering on poverty, in a num-ber of cases.
Some 90 or 95 inernbers will be benefitted by
this amendment. They receive at present a
total sum of $31,387.18; under the new soaqe
this amount will1 be injoreased to 85W,607.30.

271

Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: WilI that be
retroactive?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No. 0f course,
these pensions will gradually decrease by the
effluxion of time.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But the
increase will begin fromn the passage of the
Act?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: 1 think I shou1d
say a f ew words on this Bill. Last year I
brought the matter to the attention of the
House, and I arn glad to, know that this year
the Bill brouglit down has received enthusiaistic
support in another place, and also from the
press and people of Canada generally. The
work of the Mounted Police in the West is
wcll known to every Western man, and the
men who are to be benefitted by this legisiation are those who played a preeminent part
in the upbuilding and- development, of the
West in the old days.
Many of those men were pensioned 10, 15,
or 20 years ago, after 20 or 25 years' service,
on a pension of $9 or $10 a month. In the
meantime the cost of living has gone up
tremendousiy, and the dollar has shrunk in
purchasing power to almost 33 cents. The
least that. the people of this country can do,
to show their gratitude for the unselfish service of those men in t.he old days, is to recognize the fact of the difference in the cost
of living, and that the scale of pensions in
other branches of the public service is -mucli
more liberal. Therefore we shouid pass this
Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: What would be the
amount that any one individual would receive under tjhis new law-men such as those
referred to by the honourable member who

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The only figures

which give the total amount; but when the

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable

that, in accordance with the suggestion made
on Friday last, I met is Honour thse Speaker
of the House of Commons who informed me
that he very mucis regretted that any misunderstanding had arisen or that any honourable member of this bouse should have been

Dear Mr. Speaker,
I have taken cognizance of the debate which took
place in the Senate yesterday on the question of the
distribution of the prmnted minutes and proceedings
of the Gommons Committee now sitting on ocean rates.
The honourable gentlemen who have spoken eeemed
to be under the impression that some instructions or
other hs.d been given either by the Government, myself, the Clerk of the Bouse, or some other officer for
the distribution of these to the Members of Gommnons
only. I may point out, however, that the matter has
been entirely deait with by the Cominittee itself. The
resolution which you quoted clearly states that these
documents are to be printed for the use of members
of the Comniittee. No mention is made either of the
Senators or Members of the House of Gommons. Upon
investigation, however, I find this morning that 500
copies in ail have been printed and that each of .or
Memnbers was supplied with copies. This was not donc
upon any instructions f rom the Clerk of the House
but the ChieS Committee Clerk, acting upon the requet
of several members, deemed it advisable to make that

held investigations over the Hudson Bay project and
the fuel question it ordered its evidenoe to be printed
but did not distribute the same to the Members of the
Blouse of Gommons. It bas always been accepted as a
principle here that until a Committes, dooument has
been laid on the table oS the Bouse it doe not become
a parliamentary paper in the sense that it must be
distributed to the Members of both Houses.

BANKRUPTCY BILL
CONSIDERED

IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand. the
Senate werst into Conmmittee on Bill Z3, an
Act te amend the Bankruptey Act.
Hon. Mr Robinson in the Chair.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would ask for
leave to have Mr. Varoe, one of the law
officers, corne te the floor.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-interpretation; "Trustee,"
"Authorized Trustee":
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Honourable gentlemen, this section is to replace paragraph
(jj) of section 2 of the Bankruptry Act. The
nature cf the amendment is shown clrarly in
the Bill.
The Hon. the SPEAKER.

(ji) "trustee' or authorized trustee" means,
pendent upon the context, any pereon-

de-

and these are the new words--including

a trust Company.

This ameodment is designed to enable trust
companies te act as trustees. There is some
doubt about their right to be appointed, in
view cf the fact that paragraph (k) of section
2 defines "corporation" te exelude such cernpanies, paragraph (aa) defines "persans" te
include "corporations as rrstrictively defined
by this section", and paragraph (ji) defines
"truster' te be "any persan appointed by the
creditors pursuant to the provisions of this
Act." Se, in reading these texts together, it
wou]d sem that the trust cornpany would be
unable to act as trustees.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Are they net acting
as trustees?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: They are. The
exclusion cf trust companies in the definition
of the word "corporation" was designed te
place insolvent trust campanies outside the
Act, but of course it was never intended that
they should be disentitled te act as trustees.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Or to wind
up their own estates.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes. Thry are
outside the pale of this Act, but they can
wînd up other estates.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Is there
a.ny distinction between provincial trust cernpanics and federal? Will this include both?
There is ne
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
distinction. It will include both.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: How cao we affect
provincial cnes?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEEP: I arn net
saying we should.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: This is rnerely enabling.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Inasrnuch
as a provincial trust company is te be empowered or authorized te act as a trustee, it
mighit be well te look at the Interprrtation Art
ini the Dominion Statutes as te what constitutes a trust rornpany. This is a Domninion
Art, and the probabilities are that in the Interpretation Art we may run acress a restrictive meanling te "trust company," cenfining it
te a Federal trust company.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I deubt if this
Art would net supersede all others when it
crme te the administration of the Bankruptcy
law. Wr define what is a trust company.

MAY 18, 1925
This section is a proposed amendment of the
interpretation clause.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I do not
allude to that; I allude to the general Interpretation Act.
Section 2 was agreed to.
On section 3-appointment of interim
receiver:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen will see that Clause 3 contains an
amendment to subsection 1 of section 5 of the
Act by adding after the words, "the court
may," the words, "if no custodian bas been
appointed and." The subsection as amended
would read:
The court znay, if no custodian has been appointed
and if it is shown ta be necessary for the protection of
the estate. et any time after the presentation oi a
bankruptcy petition, and before a receiving arder s
made, appoint an interim receiver of the property of
the debtor, or of any part thereof, and direct him ta
take immediate possession thereof or af any part
thereof.

It sometimes happens that after an authorized assignment ia made to an officiai receiver
and a custodian is appointed by him, a petition
is flled to have the insolvent declared a banjo.
rupt. In connection therewith application is
nmade under section 5 to have an interim receiver appointed, although there is already a
custodian in possession. j Contests develop
between the interim receiver and the eustodian. There is no reason for the appointment of an interim, receiver if a custodian bas
already been appointed. This amendment is
suggested by a j udge who has only to do witb
the liquid'ating of insolvent estates.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGEEED: Does the
interica receiver put up security?
Hon. 'Mr. DKNDURAiND:
Oh, yes.
Hon. Sir JAMiES LOUGHEED: You make
no provision for that here.
Han. Mr. DANDUPLANO:
It is in the
Act.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I do flot
think the Act 'would extend to the interim
receiver to be appointed, so far as security
is concerned.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I had occasion
to read the wbole Act since we separated, and
I found there was provision for that.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
The
present Act apparently did not contemplate
such an officer being apypointed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURLAND:
The receiver,
the interim receiver, and the custodian, are
ail three obliged to give security.
S-18ý

275

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: This -is not, providing
for any new rnachinery; it is merely to
exclude double machinery.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But this
deals with the appointment of an officer
apparently not contemiplated by the Act, that
is to say, an interini receiver in the absence
of a custodian. If the Act did not conteniplate the appointment of such an officer, it
seems to bc manifest that it could not have
made provision for bis putting up security.
Hon. Mr..DANDURAND: Under the Act
there existed and stili exist two offices, that of
custodian, wbo can be appointed by the
officia! receiver, and that of interim receiver,
who can be appointed by the court; and I
am convînced that the Act contains a clause
which covers them both.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOIJGHEED: I amn
simply asking the question. I arn not deeply
concerned in the matter.
Section 3 was agreed to.
On section 4-adlidnistration of insolvent
farmers' eptates by provincial governnient
officer:
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: This is a new
section.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: And a
new policy.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: It inaugurates
to sanie extent a new pýolicy, that is, a policy
dealing witb the farmer who is insolvent. I
do not know whetber a regulation bas been
passed in any of the provinces appointing an
officer for the purpose od looking after the
estates of farmers -in financial distress, but I
know that in Saskatchewan since the war we
haehad a Moratorium Act on the statute
book. The legal question arose whether that
Act could bave a general application to an
individual wîthout a declaration, but I amn not
aware that that phase bas ever been dealt
with in a court.
I think the legisîstion aimed at is very
desirable, and I do flot see why that section
could flot be widened, so that the Lieutenant
Governor in Council could do by Order in
Council what would be done by an Act of the
legislature. In Saskatchewan, and I tbink also
in Manitoba, a functionary is appointed by
the Government wbo becomes an intermediatary between the creditors and the debtor
farmer. He exercises his good offices; be uses
no legal compulsion whatever, because no advantage is taken of the war-time moratorium.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
If my honourable friend will follow me I think be will find

the British North America Att. But the
judicial authority goos further and states that,
inmmediately a Bankruptcy Att is passed, a
province casn no longer legisiate along those
linos.
Whatever legislation is upon the statute
books of the provinces is there, in my judgment by x-irtue nf their having exercised their
authority or jusisdiction provinus to this Parliament exercising its jurisdiction in tht passage of a Bankruptcv Att. The authority
xvhich wt possess under the Britishi North

They
Hon. Sir JAMES L'OUOGIUiE-D:
legislated as far as t.hey could go. I think
ail tht provinces did that, and the judicial
authority indicated tht extent to which they
could go. If that 'be tht case. under this
section vou practically seek to validate that
legislation, and to say that both tht provinces

MAY 1S, 1925
and this Parliament m'iy legisiate. That seems
to me to bc a contradiction of judicial. authority on this particular question.
Hon. Mr. DAýNDURAND: The Minister
of Justice, in drafting this amnsndment, desired
to enable t.he western provinces, or any other,
to provide for the administration 'of farmers'
estates by a Government official. It is said
that farmers have very often no assets free
of liens, or security available to pay the ordinary costs of administration; consequently
they cannot at present take advantage of the
Bankruptcy Act and obtain a discharge. This
section wvas suggested by the Canadian Counicil
of Agriculture, and certain Alberta members
of Parliament. I continue to read the section
4 (2):
Any officer so appointed ta the office of custodian by
the Officiai Receiver shali thereupon in addition ta
such office be and be deemned to be the authorized
trustes as if appointed under subsection (1) of section
15 of t!us Art, and shall continue ta be the authorized
trustee tintil properly remnoved under subsection (2) of
the said section 15.

1 may also read subsection 3:
In case any such provincial officer is appointed custodian and trustee, hie shall not bie entitied under this
Act ta be paid any remuneratian as custodian or trustee
nor ar.v of the costs enumnerated as costs of custodian
in Part III of the Generai Raies.

I do not see thast there is any recognition
of provincial aut.bority to legisiate on the
same iines as the Parliament of Canada. This
BiH simplv declares that if the LieutenantGovernor has appointed ýan officer with duties
which in bis opinion are analogous to those
of custodian or trustee under this Act-and
there may be such officer appointed, acting
as regîstrar of a court, with certain powers-lion. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That presupposes that the provinces have legisiation
somewbat similar to this.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: They may have
had an officer appointed *before this Act
passes, for the distribution of the estates of
insolvents, and that is perfectly legal and constitutional. The officer being thus appointed
for the liquidation of these estates, or being
the registrar of a court charged with certain
duties which would be somewhat similar to
these, could assume the duty of liquidating
those small estates of farmers that have practical]y no liquid assets to answer for the
costs of an official. receiver or trustee.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: It seems
to me that an officer under a provincial
statute could not become seized of the powers
here suggested, because if an insolvent estate
bas passed under this Act none of the provincial statutes are operative.

27ý

lion. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: And they
faîl to the ground.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I refer tc
the officer appointed under a statute of a province contemplating that the estate of the insolvent will vest in him under the Act. The
Bankruptcy Act supercedes the provincial Act,
and takes the estate under its administration.
Where there is no estate to administer, there
can he no officer -appointed. It seems to me
that section Sc is unhappily worded.
1 understand that Quebec Province has a
law which gives power to appoint a guardian
or curator, as be is called there; but if the
officer mentioned here is appointed under the
provision of the Insolvents Act. I cannot see
hcw this section can be operative at ail.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Referring to tbe
remark which bas been made by the leader
on the other side (Hon. Sir James Lougheed),
I would say that under the constitution there
are certain matters in reference to wbich if
the Dominion Parliament legislates, the
powerg of the provinces are exbausted. Bankruptcy legisiation is declared to be exclusively
within the jurisdiction of the Dominion
Parliament; but when a province legisiates in
the direction of providing for the distribution
of assets of debtors, this is not legislating in
matters of bankruptcy at ail, and the courts
have so maintained. That leislation, therefore, cannot be -affected by any Act the Federal
Parliament bas passed re'lating to bankruptcy.
I know of no judgment of a court, and cannot
imagine any, going to the extent of saying
that, because the Dominion Parliament
bas passed a Bankruptcy Act, provincial
legislation such as that to which I have
referred bas become obsolete or superceded.
I am pretty familiar with this subjeet, hecause the law to wbicb I refer was passed by
the province of Quebec, wbicb was tbe first
province tbat passcd that kind of legislation,
and I prepared, the Bill, and bad it passed by
the legislature against the opinion of the
Attorney General at the time who afterwards
became Judge Loranger. His contention was
that it was in the nature of a Bankruptcy Act,
and therefore not within the powers of the
Legislature.
I contended the contrary, and
succeeded in baving the Act passcd by the
Legisiature, and it was tested before the court
and maintained.
As to the point raised by thse bonourable
member from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton), this section merely provides that,
if any province bas entrusted any person
within that province to see to the distribution
of a debtor's assets, bis duties being similar to
those of the officer for tbe protection of tbe

SENATE

property of a debtor, or to those which are
confided to a custodian under the Bankruptcy
Act, such an -officer may act. The amendment
would have this effeet: that the Bankruptcy
Act woîîld take its c.ourse and have fuît effeet.
and the estate would pass by virtue of the Act;
but the person entrusted with the guardianship of the estate for the time being, instead of
being appointed, hy the court, or by the
officiai receiver, would be of neeessity the
person designated by the Province.
How
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
can a provincial statute appoint a man
custodian or trustee under this Act?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: That is not t-he effect
of the Act. The Act merely states that if a
person having such and such qualifications
happens to exist, it shahl be the duty of the
court or of the officiai receiver to appoint
that person as guardian. We have sheriffs and
bailiffs in the Province of Quebec, and in other
Provinces you have sberiffs. What would prevent Parliament saying that the person to be
appointed as custodian shahl be the sheriff of
the district?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Ccrtainly
it tan be done, but it is not done here.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: But tbey are doing
the same thing-instead of saying the sheriff,
they say some other officer.
Who sbouid
Hon. Mr. DAINDURAND:
my honourable friend insist that no officer
having to any degree any analogous fon-ction
in the distribution of estates belonging to the
provincial authorities could be utilized under
this Act? Why should my honouraýble friend
say that it is repugnant to the rights of the
Federal Parhiament that there should be such
an officer? 1 understand that in Alberta, in
the considerable dry area where it was impossible for the farmers to raise any crops,
there was some kind of a moratorium declared
by this statute, and that an officcr was appointed to sec that the persons who could
benefit by the moratorium should ho protected. Wby should not the Federal Parliament designate a paid officer of the provincial
authorities who will be obliged to attend te
the liquidation of these smnall, estates of
fairmers free of charge?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There is
no objection to that.
Why
Hon. Mr. LYNCII,STAUNTON:
could not that person be appointed by the
couîrt without this section? There is no objeýction to appointing bim anyway. If they
would provide that any sucb custodian would
have the preference under this ActHon. Mr. BMIQUE

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The object of the
section is te, save costs. The section declaires
that this person shall be appointed and shall
flot be entitled to receive an.y paysnent.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My honourable friend refers to the legislation on the
Statute Book of Quebec dea]ing with insolvent estates before the passing of this Act,
but we are unaware of the particulars or of
the extent to, which the other Provinces mnay
have legislated along similar lines; 'therefore
I say ýthat the language employed in this
section gives recognition to that legisiation,
or assumes that legisiation has býeen placed
upun the Statute Books of the other Provinces
in the absence of a general Bankrupitcy Act
passed by this Parliament. There is no necessity of giving any recognition to, or of maýking
any pronouncement upon. that fact. It would
be quite as effective if the statement were
made that the provincial authoriities should
appoint a trustee or custodian.
Hon. Mr. DAN'DTRAND: 0f course, there
is this limitation:
-the officiai receiver shall in the case of any assignment by a person engaged solely in farmimg or the
tillage of the soil appoint such officer as custodian.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOTJGHEED: Here is
the trouble. When an officer is a.ppointed as
custodian or trustee of the estate by the
Province, the first objection that will be
raised in attacking the appointment will be
that the duties of that offleer are not analogous to the duties of a custodian and truee
under this Act. Why invite litigation? You
are inviting litigation of a most fertile
character.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Why not
leave the farmer out altogether?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Flear, hear.
lon. S;r JAMES LOUGHEED: I ar n ot
rai.ýin1, that. question, but it ceems to me that
this will be a fertile source of litigation, and
actions iill be taken in court to set aside the
appointment on the ground that the Lieutenant-Governor of the Province was mistaken
in assumning that the duties of the officer were
analogous to those of the trustee under thie
Act.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: The law as it stands
is in confliet with the Civil Code of the
Province of Quebec, which defines bankruptcy
as a state of a trader who has -ceased payment. 1 have always wondered how it was
that the Bankruptcy Act, which is an Act
&ssentially relating to trade, should reach any
pr:i ate citizens not at aIl connected with
trade. That is my first observation.

MAY 18, 19M
The second is this. The more 1 read thie
Act the more it seerna to me that it is en
effort to escape the difficulty created-at leait
in the Province of Quebec, I do nlot know
how it is in the ether Provinces-by the fact
thet the Civil Code in providing for the
administration df what we caîl bankruptey
here, was nlot legislating on bankruptey, but
on the affairs of a man who couid nlot meet
his liabilities.
Lest year I had an axnendment which I
presented to this House, but which I did flot
press. It was a repetition of the language
of the Civil Code-that the Bankruptcy Act,
as far as the Province of Quebec was concerned, ehouid apply only to traders. That,
to rny mmnd, would have met the difficulty.
Representetions were made to me that if the
arnendinent were passed the administration
would be hy the prothonotary of the district,
and that regulations had been mrade te enable
him to reach the end desired. In the Province of Quebec the farmer was flot a trader
eny more than a lawyer, and I abandoned rny
amendment because the prothonotaries repreeted that in the previous yeur nlot a
single fariner ha;d gone into ban-kruptcy, and
that it wes hetter te let well enough alene.
I would like te be enlightened se to whether
the law applies to citizens ini every walk of
life, or only to those ini trade. I do nlot think
that the fariner of the West cen be cornpared
to the fariner of the Province of Quebee. I
think every fariner in the West is a trader.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: A 'trader?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN:- Yes, a trader in grain.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
The farmer in
Quebec is a trader in potatee.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN:
I do nlot think
you can compare thein at ail1. We have a
great number of fat-mers who live on their
farins and raise families and inake a very
sinaîl revenue each year, net countin-g on the
crop te pay the value of the land. 1 think it
is important that the application of the law
shou]ld be definitely and clearly explained.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Do I
understand the honourable gentleman to argue
that the Dominion Bankruptcy Act can apply
only to people engaged in trade or commerce?
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Yea.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-6STAUNTON: It seeins
to me that is a vexry strong point, because
trade and commerce corne within the powers
of the Dominion Parliament. I neyer heard
that trade and commerce emibraced the practice of, law or farrning, and now that we are
&bout it, it seems to me that we ought to exclude the fariner altogetAier froin this Act.

279

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The law as passed
affects every member of the community, including farmers and lawyers, with this exception, that a fariner cannot he forced te
corne under the Insolrvency Act, although he
may choose te do se. I have elways contended that it lwas net witbin the power cf
this parliament te bring farmers under the
Insolvency Act, but the que.4tion has net
been raised before the courts, se far as I
know, and wben 1 raised the objection et
the time the Benkrupt-cy Act was pessed,
I was overruled. In the Province of Quebec
the farmers and other people took advantage Of the Insolvency Act, end fer rny
part I was very sorry my boneurable friend
did net persevere with bis Bill last session.
I do not eppreciate *at all the reesens -which
induced lin te aJbandon bis BiH. I have
always been, and stili arn, of the opinion
that there are ne reasens why a Bankruptcy
Act should epply te farmers, and that the
metter is outside of the jurisdiction of this
ParIiamenît.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-4STAUNTON: The Provincial Govermment if it chooses, may make
the unfortunate fermer pay ialI the ceats of this
officiai.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I have heard it
stated that the -fact that the fariner could
go into benkruptcy if he wisbed ýhas ruined
the credit of the farinera in our -part of the
world; it is seid that he mey neyer pay for
the implements be buys.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: 1 mey say frankly
that I had doubts as te the suocess of my
amendment of lest year. The Bankruptey
Act is a most extraordinary law: it is a law
ef exception. Our Civil Code provides that
ail the properties of an ordinary citizen are
the common security of bis creditors; but an
exception is made.
In trede the poroprietor
or ewner bas a stock wbich cen be liquidated
or sold in a night, and the Bankruptey Act
ins been pessed in order te enable ail tbe
creditors te seize thc stock at once.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: 1 take tIe view
that tbe legisation is desirable. I de not
agree witb niy honourable friends on this side
of the House at ail. I arn net dealing with
tbe question of 'legality or constitutionality.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Will tbe
bonoureble gentleman tell us wîat is the Iaw
in his province?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: In Alberta, I
think, they have legislation sucb as is indicated by the bonourable leader of the Gevernment. I en deel witb tIc province of

-to atIC as custod7an an~d truste~e under this Act, the
Official Rece*ver shall in the case of any assignrment
hv a pet on engaged soiely in farmning or the tillage of
the soil appoint surh officer as custodian.

MAY 18, 1925
That
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
would be better.
That would
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
remove the danger of litigation. It would remove the neefflity of a statute heing passed,
and would leave the power in the hands of the
Lieutenant-Governor in Council.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHIEED: Would it
flot be even better and more uniform to say
that notwithstanding anything contained in
the Act, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council
of any province may appoint su*ch an officer?
That would give each province authority to
appoint, even though it had flot legisiation
upon the Statute Book.
De we not
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
arrive at the same result by leaving the wording as I have suggested?
That
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
would limit the operation of the section, to
those provinces which have such an officer
already, under provincial legislation.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: There is this further
advantage in the suggestion made by the honourabie gentleman, that it would remove the
doubt as to the power of the Legîsîsture to
make the appointmnent.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Yes.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes. Give
to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council power
to appoint such an officer.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: No; to
authorize.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Or to
authorize.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I simply t'hrow
out this suggestion so that we xnay turn it
over in our mi'nds and take it up later:
Notwithstanding .anything contained in this Act, 'f
the Lieutenant-Governor ini Council of any province
has authorized, or authorizes, any officer of the provincial governusent to act as custodian and trustee under
this Act, the Officiai Receiver shall in the case cf
any assigoment by a person engaged solely in farming
or the tillage of the soul appoint such officer as custodian.

That
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
would be better.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I think that
would be much. better. That would ineet the
suggestion of the honourable leader on thîs
side (Hon. Sir James Lougheed).
If the Senate
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
is ready to accept this amendmnent, I will
propose it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is al
right.

b

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then 1 propose that the words, "charged under a provincial statute with duties whieh in the opinion of the Lieutenant-Governor ini Council
are analogous in any respect to the duties
of custodian and trustee," be struck out.
Hon. >Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: You have
nlot put in after the word "authorized" the
words, "or authorizes."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Instead. of "has
authorized' w-e will say "authorizes."
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Now you
have it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would the honourable Chairman read the clause as
amended?
The CHAIRMAN: The clause as amen ded
reads:
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, if
the Lieutenant -Governor in Council of any province
authorizes any officer of the provincial government to
act as custodian and trustee under this Act, the Officiai
Receiver shall in the case of any assignent of any
person engaged solely in farmaing or the tillage of the
soil appoint auch officer as custodian.

That is
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
ail right. "The ýOfficiai Receiver shall ....
appoint sucli officer as custodia-n." Is there
Licustodian under the Dominion statute?
Hon. Mr. DANDTJRAND: Oh. yes.
Section 4 was agreed to.
On section 5-priority 'of existing judgments in certain Provinces:
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: What is
the meaning of that?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Will my honourable friend give us some expl.nation as to
this clause?
I will. The
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
present stibsection 16 of section il is to this
effect, that judgments in New Brunswick and
Nova Scotia registered before the Bankruptcy
Act came into force shail not be affeeted hy
subsections 1 and 10, which give priority to
the assignment or receiving order. The reason is that a judgment in those provineas
is regarded as a security. The legal hypothea
in Quebec is siniilar and should have been
similârly provided for. The amendmnent will
remedy this omission.
'Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My honourable friend will admit, I fancy, without
any hesitation that a judgment in the
province of Ontario or the other provinces
is quite as valuable to the holder as in Nova
Scotia. New Brnswick or Qudbec. Why
should this discrimination take place?

282

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If my honour.-hle friend will tell me why he made the
discriminc.tion in favour of Nova Scotia and
New Brunswick when he brought in the Bankruptcv Bill, I will tell bim why Quebec should
foluw suit.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I disclaim
being aware of the fact at the time. But I see
no occasion for discrimination of this kind.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do flot raise
that question seriously.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The judgment of the Court in favour of a creditor in
any other province is quite as valuable to the
creditor as the judgment in those three provinces. There could not be provincial legisiation taking those judgments outside of the
Bankruç,tey Act, because when the Bankruptcy
Act was passed, notwithstanding the priority
which those judgments had, they came witbin
the purview of the statute.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: This may be the explanation regarding Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick. It is one forma of security there,
instead of taking a mortgage, to get a confession of judgment. That is recorded, and the
statute says it shall bind a man's land as if it
were a mortgage. Does such a form exist in
Ontario?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is
practically the saine in the other provinces.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: We have
not that in Ontario.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Apparently this
point was made in favour of the Nova Scotia
and New Brunswick judgments, and was not
made for Ontario.
But I may say that
Quebec is absolutely on ail fours--that in
Quebcn judgînent against a debtor, whicb is
rcgistered, stands and bas the full effect of a
niortgagc or hypothec.
-Hon. Mr. LYNCII-STAUNTON: So it dos
in Ontario.
Hlon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will not speak
for other provinces. I know of my own
province, and Quchec judgments should have
been excepted, as Nova Scotia and New Brunswick judgments were. It is because of the
omission that the Department of Justice, in
response to representations fromn judges who
are applying the Act, is suggesting the amendment. But now if honourable gentlemen helonging to the Bars of the other provinces
dlaim that their situation is similar, and if the
prnciple is good, there is no reason wby it
should not be made universal and maintained
in ail cases.
Hen. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: There is a very
good reason in the province of Quebec. The
Civil Code states very clearly fhat wben the
judgment is registered it stands as a mortgage,
unless it bas been registered within tbirty days
of the bankruptcy. In that case the onus is
on the holder of the mortgage to establish bis
good faith. Now, I understand, that is going
to be donc away with altog-ether.
Hon. Mr. DANDL'RAND:

No.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: There was an exception made in the law as drafted, which exception now disappears?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No, no. Tbere
was an exception made in favour of Nova
Scotia and New Brunswick, and it did not
cover the Quehec case.
Hon. Mr. LYN'CH-STAUNTON: Is it the
law of Quebec that if I borrow $500 froin a
man, I give him a judgment as a mortgage?
That is what the bonourahie gentleman says
is the law in Nova ýScotia.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It may be in
Nova Scotia, but it is not that in Quebse.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Your
law in Quehec is the saine as ours in Ontario.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
must sue and obtain judgment.

That is, we

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, and
the writs of execution are placed in the bande
of the sheriff?
lIon. Mr. DANDURKND:

No.

We regis-

ter the judIgments.

Hlon. Sir JAMES ILOUGHEED: But they
hiave binding effeet. Ahl these lands are tide
un) bv reason of such judgments.
Hon. Mr. DA'NDURAND:
0f course I
cannot speak as to the law in the various prov-

mnes, but apparcntly Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick are exernpted, because their judgment, registered, had the value of a mortgage securitx'; and Quebec is in exactly the
samne position. Representations bave came
from the judges who administer this Act in
the province, and the words, "-and Quebec" are
sougth to be added after "Nova Scotia, New
Brunswick."
Hon. Mr. BIEAUBIEN: The effect of the
clause, I understand, is to niake a distinction
between the mortgages registered prior to the
coming into force of the Act and the judgments to be registered afterwards. I arn dealing purely and, simply with wbat wihl happen
after the Bankruptcy Act comes into force. Is

MAY 18, 1925
it or is it not a fact that aftcr the Act cornes
into force a iudgmcnt registered in the province of Qucbec will flot have priority over the
bankruptcy? That is what 1 want to know.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will read subsection 16 of section il of the Act, as it
stood:
(16) The provisions of paragraplis one and ten of
this section shal nlot apply te any judgment or certifloate of judgment registered against real or ûmmovable property in either of the provinces of Nova
Scotia and New Brunswick prier te the commig into
force of this Act, which. became, under the Ilaws of the
prov'ince wheren At was registered, a charge, lien or
hypothec upon such real or immovable property.

-

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUO:HEED: My honourable friend is familiar with the law of Quebec. May I ask hini if it is not possible to
register any judgment that may be obtaîned
in that province? Does it not becomne a lien
or a hypothec?
Hon. Mr. DANDURLAND: Yes.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Then it
gives a superior standing to a judgment in
Quebec?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: A 1,riority.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEE: A priority
as againet the other provinces? A judgment
in the othei, provinces has the same effect,
I presume. Writs of exécution, 'when. issued,
are chargeable against the lande of the debtor,
and-be- cannet- dispose of the lands without
satisfying the judgmnent. In -the western provinces the judgment gives prioriîty te the
judgment in the order in which it was
registered.
Hon. Mr. BELCOUJRT: The filing of an
execution in Ontario does net give the creditor
any prierity except as te his costs.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:- Neither
dees it in Quebec.
Hon. Mr. BELCOIJRT: Yes, it dees. The
situation in Ontario is entirely different frora
what it is in Quebec. A judgment registered
in Québec, with the notice prescribed, gives
the holder a priority over ordinary crediters
-practically a mortgage; but it is not se in
Ontario.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: In what
way would it be possible for ýthis Bankruptcy
Act te have an effect upon any judgment
ini the province cf£ Quebec?-becaume mimedîately the judgment is dbtained it is
registered.
non. Mr. BELÇOURT: No; the judgmeult
is registered, but it is registered in the ceurt,
with -the Prothonetary, and is entered into
the efficial beoks kept by the Prothenotary.

283

The Registrar.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
What
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
nature of a judgment would flot be exemnpted
frem

this Act?

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: (In order te have
priority, or to create a real right of some
sort, you have to register with the Registrar
of the registration division of the county,
accomipanied with a notice that you want the
judgment te affect su-eh and such property,
which muet be described, and if the property
is flot described, you get no lien or priority.
Hon. Sir JAM:ES LOUGUEED: Could not
that -be done with different judgments?
Hon. Mr. BELGOURT: No, becau.se it is
only occasionally you have to register a judgment, and that mnust run against the property.
Frequently the judgment you get agaînat
debtors who have no real property, and there
is no occasion to register that judgment unless
the real estate owned by the debtor is to be
affected by the judgmenýt.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: In the
judgment is -the subject-matter a specifie property?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes, and a certified copy of the judgrnent of the court must
be accompanied with the notice to the Registrar calling upon him to register that
particular judgment against thýat particular
property. ljnless it is accompanied by that
notice, it is of no use s/t ail.
Allow me te
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
drw attention to, the fact that this legislation

I would like te
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
ask rny honourable friend if the registration
of the privilege or mortgage created by a
judgment is clearly within the rights of a
province? It is a method of distributing the
assets of the person in bankruptcy; how can
the Federal power interfere with that?
We obviate
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
that question being raised, as ýfar as the
province of Quebec in eoncerned, by reinstating the parties who had a prior claim, by
registration of a judgment before this Act

MAY 18, 1925
Hon. Mr. LYNCU-STAUNTON:
It is
certainly retroactive.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I see no objection
to this legislation, because the section only
speaks of the date of the Act having corne into
force, and it cannot possibly include any judgment wbich bas been rendered since. It may be
that we are flot curing the whole trouble;
that in the meantime, since 1920, judgrnents
have been rendered in the province of Quebec
whicb, if this provision had been inserted ini
1920, would have protected those judgments
and secured to thema the priority which they
secured by registration. How we are going
to cure that I do noV know. 0f 'course this
oannot apply Vo other judgments in Québec;
it only applies to judgments wbich have been
subject to liquidation under the Bankruptcy
Act.
With regard Vo the question of constitutionality, may I remind my honourable
friend that the Privy Council time and agaîn
bas held that wben the Parliament of Canada
is dealing witb subi ects which are quite within
its Jurisdiction it may incidentally make
provisions which are in absolute conflict with
matters of provincial legislative jurisdiction.
Parliament can affect, and bas in many instances seriously affected, the law of property
and civil rights in the Province of Quebec; but
iA bas been beld by the Privy Council that
thi6 is quite permissible wben Feýderal jurisdiction is being exercised in regard Vo a subi ect
clearly witbin that jurisdiction.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: That is flot incidentai.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGREED: The only
way the bonoura-ble gentleman from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) could be satisfied
as Vo the point he bas raised would be by a
declaration in this Act that alI judginents 50
registered sbould not corne witbin this Act.
That would be an anomalous condition.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
You cannot do
that, because some of those judgments have
been disposed of under the provisions of the
Bankruptcy Act.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUTE:
The point raised
by the bonourable gentleman from Montarville bas a great deal of force Vo, this extent:
That a judgment obtained before the passing
of the Bankruptcy Act and registered on a
property constituted an acquired civil right.
1V gave a preference to the credîtor under the
civil law; therefore Vhere was a civil right
acquired. 1 think it is not within the province
of the Federal Paxrliament to, destroy that
civil right. I arn agreed with the honour-

285

able gentleman from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) that judgments bave been rendered
by the Privy Council that put it within the
power of this Parliament in legislating on
bankruptcy Vo govern the acquisition of civil
rigbts or Vo prevent the claiming of civil
rights after the passing of the Bankruptcy
Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I think this
discussion bas clarifled the situation Vo a considerable extent.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: And confused it Iikewise.
Hon. Mr. DANTYURAND:
I will move
that the clause stand so that we may see if
there is any necessity of adding a proviso
wbich will cover the liquidation of estates in
wbich there were judgments registered before
the Bankruptcy Act of 1920, and in wbich the
wbole liquidation bas taken place and the
trustee has obtained his discbarge.
Section 5 stands.
Section 6 was agreed Vo.
On section 7-dealings with undischarged
bankrupts:
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAIINTON: Wbo is
Vbe "authorized assignor?"
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: In wbat
way is he autborized? WbaV does that adjective mean?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Tbe "authorized
assignor" is one who bas gone Vo the official
receiver and bas made an abandonment of
bis property. Wben he is authorized Vo, make
that abandonment, he is an autborized
assignor.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUýNTON: He is a
bankrupt.
Hon. Mr. DANDURA.ND: Yes, but he has
noV yet been declared a bankrupt.
Hon. Mr. BELOTRT: Wby je he called
"'authorized?"
Hon. Mr. DANDURA.ND: Recause he has
been duly authorized Vo, do so, by the statute.
Hon. Mr. JAMES LOUGHEED: He has
done it voluntarily. I think that is an unfortunate expression.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: An authorized
assignor is one wbose debte exceed M50.
I bave an amendment Vo, suggest, namely,
Vo insert after the 'word "order" tbe following
words, "or authorized assignment."

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Will flot this have the
effect of validating transactions which may net

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
words "bona fide."

We have the

Hon. Mr. BEIQUJE: It may be a transaction with a bona fide creditor, but under
the Iaw it might he void because it would
have the effeet of giving an undue preference to a creditor. I would suggest putting
in the words "if other-wise valid."
Section 34 is
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
intended to validate transactions by a bankrupt-that is one against whom a receiving
order has been made-in property acquired
by bim after the receiving order. The section
should bo extendcd to transactions by an
assignr-a voluntary bankrupt,-with respect
to property acquired 'by him after he has
made an authorized assignment. Such property, since the armendments of 1923, belongs
f0 the creditors as a resuit of section 25, just
the same a-s property acquired after a recervrng order. These changes should have been
made in 1923.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUTE: My arnendment does
not defeat the objeet in view, but it would
prevent validating transactions.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend takes no issue with the form of the
proposed arndment, but dlaims that it sbould
be further amended.
-Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Yes.
I do not think the
Hon. W. B. ROSS:
suggested amendment is needed at ail. The
section applies only f0 property, real or
personal, that the bankrupt acquires after the
vesting order is made. If a oonveyance was
made to a creditor with a view of giving that
creditor a preference, it would not be in good
faith, it would bo a clear breacha of the
Bankruptcy Act.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Well, I withdraw my
suggestion.
Section 7 was agreed te.
On section 8-discharge of trustee:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In section 8 the
word's " the trustee fails te make such application accordingly " are added, and in paragraph
3, bet.ween the words " or the court " and the
words " and proof," the following words are
struck ouf.:
-a period of two years bas elapsed, after paymnent of

Mr.
Hon.
presont the law is that a trustee may receive
five per cent and the solicitor five per cent.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Under this section the trustee must produce
bis accounts and have them aipproved by the
inspectors or by the court. A great many
abuses have crept in. I arn told that charges,
both by solicitors and by trustees, bave been
in excess of tbe costs allowed under the Act,
because the inspectors did net understand the
statute. I therefore move that we strike eut
the words, "the inspectors or."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

In what line?

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: In lines
2 and 3 of subsoction 3. That would render
it necessary for the trustee te submit bis account s te the Court. The judge understands
vwbat the tr-ustee and the solicitors are entitled te; tbe inspectors do net. The clausa
would then cead:

it shou]d bave read that way in the beginning.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The enly objection that I see is that it will add costs.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: No. The
Act limits the costs te a percentage. It will
net add any cests.

Section 9 was agreed to.

of the Act undoubtedly now is that Parliament merely confers jurisdiction in bankruptcy on the provincial courts, anid cousequently Ppxliýament has no authority to enable
barristers of one province to practice in
an-other. The section is likely ultra vires.
Section 12 was agreed to.

On section 10-certain facts on which discharge may be refused, suspended or granted
conditionally not to apply to farmers:
Hon. Mr. DANDTJRAND: I had occasion
on the second reading to explain why this
clause was put in. Subsection 5 of section 58
provides that the court shall refuse or suspend the discharge, if any of the facts mentioned in section 59 are proved against the
insolvent. The facts mentioned in paragraphs
(b) and (c) are thiat the ïnaulvent has
omitted to keep books and that he has continued to trade after knowing himself to be
insolvent. It is represented that in the case
of the insohrent farmer the proof of these two
facts should nlot disentitle him to a discharge,
because few farmers keep books and a bad
crop may render the farmer insolvent but he
cannot discontinue farming.
Section 10 was agreed to.

On section 13--penalty for acting as trustee
without bond:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Paragraph (b)
of section~ 96 is merely ta make a change
which should have been made in 1923 and has
the object of making the section articulate
with section 14.
Section 13 was agreed to.

On section 11-power to Minister of Justice

Hon. Mr. DANI>URAND; The present
subsection 6 of section~ 64 authorizes the
Minîster of Justice to assign county or district
judges to exercise the bankruptcy jurisdiotion
if the Chief Justice of the province reporte
that the judge of the superior court is unable
to exercise the jurisdiction. Hlowever, it is
desired to enable the Minister ta give jurisdiction, to the local judges in addition to that
exercised by the superior court rather than
in place thereof. Furtherinore it i8 desired to
enable the Minister to limit the jurisdiction
conferred if he thinks it advisable; for
example, to give them the judicial authority
of registrars only.

proceedings. This section was justîfied when
first enacted, because it was thought that

COMMUNISM IN CANADA
INQUIRY

AND

DISCUSSION

Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN inquired:
Is the Government aware that President MeLeod,
Vice-President McDonald, and Secretary McKay of
the United Mine Workers of America, District 26,
publicly took part in the Communit demonstration
held at Glace Bay, N.B., on the let inst., and that ail
three walked behind the red flag at the head of their
respective sections on that occasion.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Stand.
H1on. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
I would like* to
say just- a few words on the inquiry which
stands in my name. I intend to be very
brief, but I think that I owe it to, the House,
if neot to myself, to give a few explanations.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I would point
out to the honourable gentleman that the
wording of bis inquiry does not entitle him
to address the House. With the leave of the
House he can do so.

288

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I would the crave
the leave of the House to say a very few

I am sorry. It
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:

Hon. Mr. BEALBIEN: The discussion on
the troiibles in the mines in Nova Scotia lias
somewhat perdrifted until it has becon

went on, and practically stated that the remarks which I had made before this House
were totally unjustifiable as far as the U.M.W.
was concerned. I would recall that not one

association for which he claims forty year
of existence without the violation of one contract has violated in the present instance,
at several times, contracts which it has made.
There was no challenge of the facts put
before this House; still the honourable gentenian stated that the statements which I
had made ought at 'east to have been proven.
I am going to ask this House to bear in mind
this fact: that the only justification which
the U.M.W. can have is that all the trouble,
all the lack of good faith manifested down
in Nova Scotia, was absolutely outside of
its jurisdiction.
What are the real facts? In 1918, after
repeated efforts, the United Mine Workers
were allowed to come into the field of labour
in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick on the
understanding that, conditions being different
in Canada, the wages of the men were not to
be predicated on wages in the United States.
In other words, the avowed policy of the
U.M.W. is that the supply of coal in the
Ion. Mr. SPEAKER.

United States always exceeds the consumption,
and that, whatever may be the wages paid the
men, the operators will always have to close
the expensive mines, and shift and open up
cheap ones; they will never bore beyond a
certain depth under the ground but will go to
cheaper mines that are practically outcrops,
and I hat a uniform iload of labour must be
carried by the operatives. Everybody knows
fthat such conditions do not exist here-that
Nova Scotia coal bas to be dug for at an excessive cost. Therefore the United Mine Workers
were notified that if they entered the field, in
fixing the wages of Canadian miners, they
must always take into account the fact that
conditions on this side of the line were different from those prevailing on the other side
of the line.
The U.M.W. have been in absolute control
in Nova Scotia since 1918, and can anybody contend that what bas been donc
by the U.M.W., District No. 26, entails
no responsibility for then?
Do you know,
nuch money
honourable gentlemen, how
the U.M.W. of America got from the coal fields
of Nova Scotia during the course of last year?
8246.000 was the amount that the British
Empire Steel Company was constrained to pay
to these people. Why was it paid? Was it
accepted without any responsibility attached
to it? Have the U.M.W. no control over their
men? In 1922-23 one MeLachlan used seditious language, and what did they do? He
was arrested, of course, and put in prison,
and immediately he was kept, so to speak, in
the dark, and a new set of men came-a new
president in the person of MeLeod, and a new
secretary in the person of McKay. These were
the men who took the reins of government
of the U.M.W. down there. What have they
done since thon? Since then violation of
the contracts took place; since then there
lias been a persistent refusal to accept any
tribunal. But that is not all. I said that the
result of the coming of the U.M.W. was persistent labour troubles, and I am going to
establish that fact.
I have the evideneo here to prove what I
have said of the Crows Nest Pass difficulties.
It is taken froi the Coal and Fuel Record
of March 1st, 1925, published in Vancouver,
and I think that when honourable gentlemen
read it and compare it with my speech, the
verdict will be that instead of going beyond,
I have kept well within the limits of the facts:
Crow's Nest Pass Coal Co. and the Miners
The Crow's Nest Pass Coail Company has one of the
most valuable coal properties in North America. The
coals produced are high grade bituminous, specially
adapted to railway, steam, smithy and coking uses. The

MAY 19, 1925
company's mines are splendidly equipped for econoîny
and safety of operation. They are under first-class
management, W. R. Wilson, Preaident and General
Manager, having an international reputation through
bis kiucresaful operation of coal mines in Great Britain,
the United States, Canada and South Mirica. The mines
have a presenit annual capaeity of 1,000,000 tons of coal
and 200,000 tons of coke. They could produce 10,000
tons a day if called upon to do an, and their full operation coulil make Fernie the largest and most important
inland city in British Columbia.
Unfortunately, during the war, the Dominion Government undertook the direction of coal mine operetions
throughout Canada, on the plea that the output of
coaI must be maintained, ai whatever coat. The minera
were organized under the United Mine Workers of
America, controlled by foreign influences adverse to the
war, and often influenced by membership of nationale
opposed ta the Allies or unsympathetic with them. As
a result everv. opportunity waa taken edvantage of by
the Ujnited Mine Workers ta make trouble, demand
higher wages, or insist on working conditions which
increased cosi of operation and reduced the efficiency
of labor. This resulted in instability of operations. The
Goveroment eonceded aIl dernands in the effort to keep
the nation supplied witb fuel.
Owiug to the frequent strikesaend spasmodio operations, sometimes extending only aver baîf the year, the
rai'lways found they could no longer depend on the coal
supply for their fuel requirements, and were forced tn
subatitute fuel oul.
fimelters formerly using Crows'
Nesi coke had to place their orders elsewhere. The
Great Northern Railway interests, which conirol the
Crewas Nest Pasa COa Co., and were consumnera of
as much as 2,000 tons a day, had to withdraw their
business from, their awn mines. As a resaIt the market
for the eampany's coal beceme disorganized; minera
had to go on short tie;
production decreased; and
the former prosperous condition of the industcy gave
way to depressian in the company's operation as well
as in trade generally.
The lest strike, extending from. April till November
of last year. was the straw that broke the labor emel'a
baek. So long out of work, and with the United Mine
Workers unable to finance the maintenance of the men
it had called oui, misery and want followed months
of idieness. Sonme of the minera soughi work in the
inetal mining camps or in the Jogging camps. In the
fermer they found the work barder and the pay les
than i0 the coaI mines, and longed to get beck to their
regular occupation. The depression in the lumber industry again threw oui of work those who were findîng
temporary relief there. When the Legialature met et
Victoria, ane of the firat items of business wes the
dmand of Thos. Uphill, M.L.A., for charitable aid
from, the Provincial Governxnent for the miners out of
work at Fernie. He painted a dismal pieture of their
distresa, and that of their familles for swhich they hart
themasîves entirely to bleme. They were nt eniled
ta relief under the circumsances, bat in the bignes
af its heart the Goveroment arranged ta stant road
works for the temporary employment of the minea.
Goveroment wages on public works did nt compare
with wbat they had been earning in the mines; and
the out-door work emid snow and ice ai that sesson
was far frora congenial.
Mr. Wilson, as General Manager of the Crow's Nest
Pesa Goal Company, had long formen the conditions
ahead, and had et varjous times tried ta reason with
the men in an effort ta arrive et a permanent beaui of
operetion ta the mutuel edvantege of the company
and the minera. Tbe United Mine Workers were controlled by a force of boîsheviste, and they were succeesfui i0 resisting ail attemptsaet aesttlement until, ins

war bonus, and working conditions that bed existed
during the pat fcw years, it was impossible to find

I do not want to say what the U.M.W.

honourable friend can remember what they
did in Herrin, Illinois. The most dastardly
crime ever perpetrated by labour was committed there after the message from Mr.
Lewis came stating that surface men, I
think they calil them, a steam shovel association of some kind, were strike-breakers purely
and simply and should be dealt with as such.
Honourable gentlemen will remember that no
less than fifty of those men were taken out of
the mine under a flag of truce, and that as soon
as they were out they were lined up before a
barbed wire fence and shot to pieces by five
hundred miners. Nineteen of those men were
left dead on the ground, and many others
died afterwards. Is that a commendable act?
In a discussion of this kind where people are
looking for the cause of trouble I claim the
right to point to it, although I do not want
to go beyond what has taken place in our
country. So long as we have foreign elements,
whether they come from across the line or
from Europe, that sustain distrust and trouble
between capital and labour, so long shall we
have unrest and alll its terrible consequences,
and I say that if there is any remedy at all
it lies in the good strong hand of the Government, whatever it may be, to protect us
against contamination of that kind.
I thank you, honourable gentlemen, for
your courtesy in listening to me.
Honourable
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH:
gentlemen, I feel that the observations of the
honourable gentleman from Montarville (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien) afford me an opportunity of
putting certain views before the House which
bear upon this question. I agree with the
conclusion expressed in the ellosing words of
the honourable gentfleman who has just sat
down, as to the desirability of a strong hand
upon the part of the Government in this
matter, but I arrive at that conclusion from
somewhat different premises.
To begin with, it might be well to discuss
precisely what it is that we in Canada are
confronted with in connection with this question. Before the war we were familiar with
the old-fashioned Socialist. There are many

I have read these extTacets for the puilpose
of putting before the flouse the evidenýce
that the Communist movement is here in
Canada, and actively and vigorously at work.
I hope that I have at least suggested the
thouglt that the Communist movernent may
be described as a radical mavement within
the Trade Uraion movemrent, and that there
is a struggle -oing on between the conservative Trade Unionist, on the ane band, and the
radical Trade Unionist or Cornmunist on the
other.
The method of the Communists in Canada
-ndeed,
it is the samne everywhere-is to
get into the labour organization and ta bore
from within. Tbat is a fundamental principle
of their policy, and they attýain a measure of
success. There are to be found in ail labour
organizations men of th-eir type of mind.
There is another factor which I cannot
overlook-that usually the most prominent
man in the labour organization is the secretary. H1e is the man who is paid a wage
equal to his cailing, to act as sec'retary, and
bis salary depends upon hais efforts in maintaining bis union up to strength, and the
payaient of the nec-essary dues. Sa, wbile
hie is the leading man in the movernent, his
rnouth is more or less shut, because if bie
sets to work to drive the Cornmunists out hie
th.ereby reduces the nurober of rnenbers pay-

299

ing dues, and hie thereby invites an internecîne struggle. I arn inclined to the opinion,
as far as my obtservation goes, that the paid
secretary is one of the weakest factors in the
conservative Trade Unionists' figbt in the community.
There is another factor that is very noticeable in ail organizations of men of tbis type.
We noticed it in the saldier movement, wbere
we found tlîat the man wlîo was mast to the
fore with bayanet and bomb in clearing out the
enemy trench, sitnply would flot engage in an
acr:moniaus discussion with bis comrades about
any particular thing. Uc refuses to wrangle,
and if at a meeting- be attends there iis an acriinahous discussion lie se'doma cornes back to
that organizaition. So it is discovered amongst
Trade Unýionists that the best type of men, the
good loGyal law-abiding men, go to their Trade
Union organization, and if they find an acrimoniaus discussion going on between Unionasts and the othens, they simply quietly witbdraw thernselves. Tbe result is that the Cornmuniets, altbough a very small rninority, are
very noisy, and particularly in tbe West they
suoceeýd in geitting contrai of Trade Union organizations.
It is ýalsa to be rernembered thýat aur presenit
econornie condition gives a great oppartunity
to the agitator. This is the golden opportunity
of the CGmrnuniist. Let there be restored, to
Canada a full measure of prosperity, and the
Conrnuniast is -donc; but the present tirnes are
bis grcat opportunity, and it is ta be observed
that wbere there is an industrial struggle at its
warst the Cornrunist is at bis best.
Iet :me point out ta the flouse that, nat
on'ly by the experienýce of the past, nat ýonly
because in Russia the Cornmunist bas enslaved the warker as weill as the farmer, but
hecause, in the philosophy of the Comrnunist
an the one hand, and the Trade Unionist an
the ather, there is a distinct difference of
opinion-a distinct cilsh between these two
types of rnen. There cao be no Trade Unionisrn under Cammunismn. Under the collective
nwnership of tbings used .calllecetiveqy there is
nio place'- for the Trade Unionist, and the
Trade Unionist leader knows that, and the
Communist knows it also. Between the leaders
af Conmunism and tbe 'leaders af Trades
Unionisrn there is, as I said a moment aga, ia
grirn and sîIient struggÎle gaing an. Among the
rag-ta:g and bobtail of their followers there cao
be no such dlear-cut understanding, and it is
amangst tbe fdqlowers that recruits are found
for Canirunism. ýI submit that there is complete incompatibility betw.een the intelligent
Trade Unionist and the Comrnunist, and that,
so0 far as the leaders are con'cerned, they each
recognize the otber as the enemy.

not to abuse organized labour. We ought
to understand organized labour and the problem with which it is struggling, and we must

acceptable and accepted if it is backed by a
suitable majority. We may some day be confronted with the proposition that the dictatorship of the proletariat will carry in this country with a majority, and we may asIk ourselves how we would accept that state of
affairs. Italy was confronted with that very
thing, and the answer to it was the Fascisti
movement. But the dictatorship of the proletariat, to be put into effect by force, is a
very different story. It is, in point o fact,
mass theft, and I venture to think that mass
theft in Canada will be met by mass resistance. I think it a very desirable thing at
this time, when the doctrine of Communism
is being put forward, clothed in the language
which appeals to each sort of mind, that
there should come from persons in responsible
positions a definite statement as to how the
general proposition of the dictatorship of the
proletariat, to be achieved by force, presents
itself to the Canadian mind. I say this, that
red-blooded men in Canada will not submit
to the dictatorship of the proletariat to be
achieved by force; that the proposals of the
communist mean civil war in Canada. If you
tell those people that fact, straight from the
shoulder, t will do them good, and you will
be going a long way towards laying bare beHon.

Mr.

GRIESBACH.

fore the eyes of all concerned precisely what
this proposal means and to what it will lead.
Honourable
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON:
gentlemen, the honourable member from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) has opened up
a subject that in my humble opinion is of
national importance, and I rise for the purpose
of making a brief contribution and placing
upon the record exactly what the principles
and platform of the Trade Unionist movement
in North America are, and what are the principles and platform of the Communist party,
so that, lying alongside of what has already
been said, there may be for future reference
definite information as to the exact policies
of these contending forces within the industrial
field.
I am sure that most honourable gentlemen
must agree that the propaganda carried on
and the progress made in Canada, particularly
since about 1917, are not in the best interest
of peace and good government within our
country. I recall very vividly the serious
situation that arose in 1919 in Western Canada.
I remember going to Winnipeg and sitting
down to listen patiently to the grievances as
the men submitted them. After listening to
all they had to say, I stated in reply to them:
"Granting that everything you have said is
truc, and granting that there is no other side
to the question, still I am at a loss to understand how you hope to convince the people
of Canada that you are right by withdrawing,
and by depriving the women and children of
water, milk, bread, ice, and other conveniences
and necessities of life." The leader of the
strike committee in Winnipeg at that time,
who was then and is now one of the leading
Communists in Canada, looked me in the eye
and said: "The Trade Union movement has
always stood in the way of the progress of
Socialism and has got to be destroyed."
There being then on my part a perfect understanding of the intentions of these gentlemen, the situation was handled accordingly
and was subsequently adjusted; net, however,
until a mass meeting of about 4,000 men had
passed resolutions proposing to beat up a certain member of the Government and send
him back to Ottawa as an object lesson of what
Communism would do.
Therefore, honourable gentlemen, I can
speak with some knowledge of this question,
and I feel that, instead of advancing arguments or debating details, it would probably
be illuminating to state to the House just
what are the aims and ambitions of those
who are connected with the legitimate Trade
Union movement of the North American con-

MAY 19, 1925
tinent, and wbat are the aims and ambitions
of those who feel that the methods of the
Trade Unionist are too s]ow, and who purpose reaching t-heir goal more quickly, by the
direct-action methods ta wbàcb the bonoura'bltt
member fromn Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Gricsbach) bas referred.
About 1879-1 may be a lit le out ais to the
year-there was begun in the city of Philadeiphia, jn the United 'States, an organization
known as tbe Knights of Labour. That organization was ta be a militant, aggressive body,
wa'tacking capital wherever it could find an opShortly afterwards the Trade
portunity.
Union movement developed, and it bas ever
since 'been more or iess in competition wit.h
the more radical direct-action idea.
The
Trade Union movement subsequently consolidated itself in'o what is known as tbe
American Federat ion of Labour, to wbose principles the United Mine Workers of America,
as well as 11-and 1 say 101 because that
is the record-other organizations of variaus
sorts, bave subscribed. The principles of the
American Federation of Labour are, as 1 quote
fromn the record, as follows:
Whereas, a struggle is going on in ail the nations
of the civilized wvorId which grows in intensity from
year to year, and will work disastrous resuits to the
toiling millions if they are flot combined for mutual
protection and benefit;
It, therefore, behooves the representatives of the
Trade and Labour Unions of Amerîca,-

wbich include Canada-in
convention assenibled, to adopt such measures
and desseminate sucli principler among the mechanics
and labourers of our country as will permanently unite
them to secure the recognition of rights to which they
are justly entitled.
We, therefore, declare ourselves in favour of the
formastion of a thorough Federation, embracing every
Trade and Labour Organrization in America, organized-

mark you-un<ler

the Trade Union rystrsn.

Tbe abjects are, as per section 4 of tbeir
Constitution, as fallows:
An Amnerican Federation of ail niational and international Trade Unions to aid snd assist eacb other;
to aid and encourage the sale of union label goods,
and to serure legisiation in the interest of the working people, and influence publie opinion, by peacef ul and legal methods, in favour of organized labour.

These are tbe principles laid dawn, upon
which the American Federa.tian of Labour

was and is founded.

Their economie platform

cantains several planks, as follows:
1. Tihe abolition of ail forms of involuntary servitude, except as punishment for crime.
2. Free sehools, free textbooks and compulsory education.
3. Unrelenting protest against the issuance snd abuse
of injunction process in labour disputes.
4. A work-day of not more tban eight boucs in the
twenty-four-hour day.
5. A strict recognition of not over eight bours per
day on ail Federal, State or municipal work, and not

295

less than the prevailing per diema wage rate of the
nlass of empinyment in the vicinity where the work
is performed-

which is exactly tbe faiT wage clause that bas
been in Government cantracts in Canada,
bath Fedleral and Provincial, ever since about
1907.
6. Release from empisyment onie day in seven.
7. The abolition of tbe contract systcma on public
work.
8. The municipal ownership of public utilities.
9. The abolition of the sweat-shop system.
10.«Sanitary inspetion of factory, workshop, mine
and home.
1l. Liability of employers for injury to body or bass
of life--

Referred ta in aur compensation laws.
I need not go tbrougb tbe wbole list, but I
will if the flouse desires. Those are the main
principles.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I would like ta
he3r the rest.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Very well. I have
no abjection wbatever.
12. The nationalization of telegrapb and telephone.

Tbey biad noyt gane ta the extent of including ahl transportation.
13. The passage of anti-child-labor laws lin states
where they do not exist and rigid defense of themn where
they have bren enacted into law.
14. Woman s.uffrage co-equal with man suffrage.
15. Suitabir anoi pientiful playgrounds for the children
in ail cities.
16. The Initiative and Referendum and tbe Imperative
Mandate and Right of Recal-

-with wbich many of us pcrhaps do not
agree.
17. Continued agitation for the public bath systema
in ail cities.
18. Qualification in permits to build of ail cities and
towns , that there shall be bathrooms and bathroom
attachuients in ail bouses or compartmnents used for
habitation.
19. Wr favour a systrrn of finance whereby money
shall be issurd exclusiveiy by the Govermnent, with
such regulations and restrictions as -will protent it from
manipulation by the banking interesîs for their own
private gain.

That constitutes the entire programme in
every regard.
Now, 1 would ask honourable gentlemen ta
'listen with patience ta the programme and
platform of the Communist Pnrty, which, as
my bonourable friend from Edmonton has
said, is an outgrowth of dissatt;cfaction among
workmen in North America who were disgruntled becauâe of what they regard as the
too slow progress towards the attainment of
tbe ambitions wbich were enunciated in the
plaqtform tbat I have just read. This programme bas been supplemenred and encouraged in large measure by recason of propaganda that bas corne ta this country, from
Europe particularly; and I must add this

ask y ou to mark that statement.

I wili

repeet it:
111. The Coumnnst Party muat engage actively in
the struggle to revolutionize the trade unions.
As against the tradte uuiouismn of the American
Federation of Labour the Communiai Party propainîlustrial union
and
in lustrial unionism
gandizes
organizations emiphasicing iheir revolutionary implicais not simply a mens for
tions. Industrial unionismn
the every-day struggte againsi capitalism; its ultimate
purpose is revolutionary, implying the necessity of
ending the capitalisi parliamentary state. Industrial
uniosim is a factor lu the final mass action for the
co1îquýst of power, as it wîi consticute the biais for
tIse industrial administration of the Communist Commonwealth.
(a) The Commiuniai Party recognize that the Amaencan. Federation of L.abour is reactionary and a bulwark
of capitalisai.

Now. honourabie gentlemen, you cen appreciate that there is a wide difference of opinion
between tue men adhering to the platform of
that organization and tho6e who adhere to
the principies and policies Of legitima&te Trede
Unionism, and who propose to co-operate with
other branches Of society in building up
national institutions bath industrialIy and
politically. I went to make it ýclear that the
United Mine Workers of Amnerica, with a
meînbership at the time this book was
writtenHon. Mr. BELCOURT: Who is the book
written by?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: This ie the
Americen Labour Year Book of 1920.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is the organ
of the Americen Federation?

Hon. Mi. ROBERTSON: No, it is publiShed irn New York by entirely independent
p eo ple.
The United Mine Workers of America are
associated with, and are the iarge.st contributors tri and~ supporters of, the Amnerican
Federation of Labour. There is within that
organization a large number of men who
have Communist sympathies, and who are
merabers of Communist bodies.
As 1 poited out a few days ago, the constitution and literature of the United Mine
Workers of America is published in eighteen
different languages, because in that industry
there are hundreds of thousands of men who
are not American-born or Canadien-boramuch less is thiqs true in Canada tha-n in the
Ujnited States-and it is a tremendous task
and a delicate one to properly control so vast
an army of men, a very substantial portion
of whom are more or less illiterate.
1 think that the House, after the discussion
that has occurreýd or may occur on this
question. will be seized of thîs main fact: that
the Trade Union movement of Nort.h
America, including Canada, is a movement
that desires to co-opergte with the existing
forma of thînrgs and only demands a square
deal, is willing to sit. down to arbitrate its
differences with employers and to reach conclusions by negotiations, and in ail cases
respects th(- law andL abides by it and doee
not suh..cribe in any wey to the doctrines
which I have just read, which are the doctrines
of a smali portion of the workmen in our
country.
Hon. Mr. BYELCOURT: Can my honourable friend give us any examples of the
American Federation taking issue with or
protesting against the actions or the principles
or propag-ande of the Communists?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes. Without
desiring- to prolong the discussion, 1 may refer
My honourable friend to the utterances on
manv occasions of the lete Mr. Gomipers, who
wes President, of the Amnerioan Fedleration of
Labour. As a concrete exemýple, may I point
OutHon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not meani
one individual expression of opinion: I quite
agree thet Mr. Gompers has on occasions
protested ageinst violence: but I meen some
common action by one or more sections-an active stop taken to counteract the Communists.
Honi. Mr. ROBERTSON: Why did not
the United States go into the war until April
1917? It is a metter of comaton knowle-dge

that it was because the 'GoverTiment of that
great country f edt that public opinion was not
sufficientfly behýind it to warrant such a step
as early perhaps, am the Governiment would
have liked. Three weeks before war was declared by the United States, what happened?
The Executive Councii of the American
Federation of Labour held a confýerence, and
following that the late Samuel Gompers notifled the President of the United States that
Labour would be behind the Govern.ment if
it desired to go into the war on the side
(if the Allies. In May, 1917, about three
weeks and tbree days fromn the tirne the
United States dec1lared war, there was he'ld
in Washington a large conference. at which
wcre presenit a substantial nurober, probably
eighty, of the largest employers of labour of
all sorts in that great rebublic, and about a
similar number of labour leaders. At that
time it was well understood that there was
to be co-operation between the Trade Union
movement and the Govern'ment of the United
States with reference to the war activîty whieh
was to be carried on. Prior to that time
the American Federation of Labour's pdlicy
had becen one of paeiflsm; but when it became apparent to that great nation, as it
hail become apparent to other nations of the
world prier to that time. that, ths:e idleas must
be temporarily laid aside and that the people
of tîjat country must help to bring about a
settlement of the world confliet, that organization repudiated aIl men who would not
loyallv get behind the country's activities,
andl the Comnmniet Party from that moment
began to segregato itself definýite&y from. the
Trade Union movement. Prior to that tiie
you knew nothing of who was who; since
then we have been able to discoved which
was which. 1 hold that is a great examp-le in
a large way of the Trade Union movement
defiuitely repudiating principles ýsuch as 1
have ouclinied bere. anil allying, itself definite]y
with law and order. At the request of the
Government of Canada of that day I happened to ho present at that. conference in
Wa4shin.ton, and1 thorefure hav e pcrsonal
knowlcdge of the faet that that wvas the
mainspring and inspiration of the whole
meeting.
Four million organized
Trade
Unionists in the UTnited States allicil themselves with the peuple of the country in that
great iundertakinýg. and since that time the
eleavago hetween the Trado Union movement
and the Commuuist movement has been
greater and more defin-ite than ever before.
Hon. Mr. ýCASGRAIN:
Was there any
action taken by the conservative labour organization with reference to, t.he action of the
Hon.

Mr.

ROBERTSON.

president of District No. 26 in rnarching
behind the red flag? WVas anytbing done?

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

It was flot until

my honourable friend put bis inquiry on the
Order Paper that I knew anything about
Mr. McLeod or the other gentlemen having
particiýpated in the May Day celebration
referred to, and I doubt very miich if Mr.
Lewis has yet any knowledge of that fact.
I will say this authoritatively, however, that
the United Mine Workers did dethrone MeLachian from bis position becauso of this very
tinng; and it may be that the United Mine
Workers xvill take action when they know
the facts in thýis case. I do not know whether
tbey know or whother tbey do not.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have nu answer
to give to the inquiry put on the Order
Paner by the honourable gentleman from.
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien). The Labour
Department is probably trying te obtain information from direct sources in Cape Breton,
but at present I cannot give the information.
MU.v
honourable friend vouches for the truth
of his statemont, and I suppose we may take
it tilI some evidence to the coritrary is brought
tu thýs, Chamber.
I may say to the honourable gentleman
from, Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbacb) tbat
ever since tbe close of the war the Governmnt bas been very attentive to follow tbe
movemients cf the Communist Party thruugbout C'anada, an<l it bas not closed its eyes te
tlic dainger of the prupaganda Nwbicb is being
sprea(1, more especially amung the yuunger
goneration. 1 believe that the authorities are
awçare cf ain effort tbat is being made in
varicus centres. such as Winnipeg, Fort
William and other places, te eniist the young
ehildren of foreigu parents by endeavouring
to get tbein to attend on Sundavs or other
day, schools whero Communist principles are
taucbet. I do not know wbat iction is being
taken to couinteract this movement, but 1 have
occa.sion to know that the Goverument is

that since 1867 it bas always been left ta the
Governor in Council. It is af very littIe
importance. I understand the Jcint Cammittee
on Printing does flot abject ta the present
form ai the clause.
HIo n. W. B. ROýSS: In the light of the
distribution ai ýCommittee praceedings the
other day I think it would be almast as well
ta have leit this Act as it was. We may flot
get copiesQ at ail now. Same persan connected
with the Privy Councîl may take it into bis
head that we are nat entitled ta them, just
as it was thought the other day that we were
not enti'tled ta copies of the evidence.
No; it only
Han. Mr. DANDURAND:
deals with the distribution of Statutes, which
has been done since 1867 by the Governar in
Council.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: But there was always
a chance that if the Governor in Council did
flot do it we could do it aurselves. There
was a blow-hole there that you have fflled up.
The matter is
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
of sa little consequence that if there is the
least objection I wiIl not insist on amending
My honourable friend must
this clause.
realize that tbe Governar in Council is baund
ta attend ta the distribution ai the Statutes,
and the first party entitled ta the volume ai
Statutes is the maker ai the laws, the member ai Parliament. Because we have been
entitled under that distribution ta only one
capy, I do flot suppose the Government will
quarrel with aur right ta have a second capy.
Han. Mr. TANNER - I do nat tbink the
bouse shauld relinquish this littie rigbt. It
may be the iact that the House bas nat
exercised the right ta say how many copies
should be distributed, but they may desire
to do that in future. I understoad irom the
statement made thé other day by the Chairman ai the Joint Committee an Printing tbat
tbey believed tbey were protected by the
general Statute, which ai course they are not.
This Bill, if passed in its propased iarm,

would override the general 'Statute. I intended ta move that the old clause be retained, and 1 will do so unless my honaurable
iriend will consent ta amend lis motion.
I stated that I
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
did nat intend pressing that amendment, because it is ai very littie consequence. As it
stands, and bas staad since 1867, the Governor in Council bas acted, as there bas been
na resolution. As I believe this ta be a
revision ai the whole Act, I wiIl have ta
reinstate the clause as it was.
Han. Mr. TANNER: It would be necessary
ta reinstate tbe whole clause in this Bill.
Yes; that is
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
why I arn asking the Chairman ta amend the
clause by striking out paragraph a and inserting the aId paragraph a.
The amendment ai Hon. Mr. Dandurand
was agreed ta.
The preamable and the title were agreed ta.
The Bill was reported as amended.

CUSTOMIS TARIFF BIL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 118, an Act to a.mend the Customs Tariff, 1907.
He said: Honourable gentlemen have before themn the Bill, with the schedules. I
need not describe the items. I think the most
important is the increase of duty on slaek
coal. The rates were 10 cents under the
British Preference, 12 cents under the Intermediate Tariff, and 14 cents under the Gencral.
The run-of-mine was 53 cents. Now it is
evened up. The proposed rates per ton under
item 588, comprisinýg run-of-mine and slack,
will be: British Preference, 35 cents; Intermediate, 45 cents; General 50 cents. This
is perhaps the most important item.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The run-of-mine
is reduced from 53 cents?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Yes, to, 50
cents.
Hon. Mr. DANIEiL: I would like to ask
the Minister a question. 'Section 3 states:
This Act shail be deemned to have corne into force
on the twenty-fifth day of March, one thousand Dine
hundred and twenty-five

The Bill is not passed yet. Amn I correct
in supposing that if on any goods, mentioned
in these various items, imported since the
25th of March, a higher rate of duty has been
paid than this Bill provides for, a rebate will
be made, and that where the duty is increased

by the Bill the amount payable on what has
been imported since the 25th of March will
be adjusted at the higlier rate?
Hon. Mr. DANDIJRAiND: I take it for
granted that the Minister announced the proposed changes on the 25th day of March, and
that the duties were altered from that date.
If there has since been a slight amendment,
in the form of a reduction, for instance, surely
the parties who have paid the higher duty
since the 25th of March would be entitled to
a rebate; but 1 do flot remember that there
bas been any such case.
Hon Mr. DANIEL: Take, for instance, the
duty on bituminous coal. The change here
is quite material.
It means that if people
have been importing this coal since the 25th
of March, they wi]l have to pay a good deal
more than they would if this legisiation were
not passed.
Hon. Mr. DAN3DIRAND:
But I thjnk
they have paid the increased duty since the
25th of March.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: They have?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: These proposais
were contained in the Budget Speech?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Hon. Wr GRIESBACH: The rule of Parliament is that from the moment of the
announcement in the Budget Speech the duty
is applied.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

Hon.,Mr. Robinson in the Chair.
On seotion 5-Priority of existing judgments
in certain provinces:
_Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, we SUSPended consideration of section 5, which adds t1he province of Quebec to
the exception .provided for Nova Scotia andl
New Brunswick.
The provisions of subsections one and ten af this
section shall flot apply to, any judgment or certificate

property in either of the provinces of Nova Scotia,
New Brunswick and Quebec......

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: -and
bring it within the present legislation.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: You do not want
the word "either" there.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: He claims that
this Bill will have effect only from the date
of its sanction. As it will have no retroactive
effect, it will not affect those judgments.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If we add Quebec
there, we should say "any". It was "either"
when there were two provinces, but when you
have more than two it is necessary to make a
change.

to

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: And as
to those judgments that have not been
liquidated?

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Why not say simply,
"In the provinces of," and strike out the word
"either?"

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It will not have
any effect on those judgments. I move the
adoption of the clause with the alteration.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Thatmight
mean tie provinces jointly.

The CHAIRMAN:
'"1any."1

The Deputy
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Minister drew my attention to the word
"either." It was correct to use it when the
dlause referred to Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick, but it should be changed to "any"
when the province of Quebec is added.
I would like to read the opinion of the
Deputy Minister of Justice on the suggested
amendment. A question was raised as to the
necessity of protecting liquidations of bankrupt estates which may have affected judgmenits registered p'rior to the coming into force
of the Act of 1920. The Deputy iMinister
thinks there is no need for any proviso of that
kind. He says:

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
suggest to my honourable friend that we should
not give the Bill third reading until we see
the amendment in print and study it from
that standpoint.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Dandurand
was agreed to, and section 5 as amended was
agreed to.
The preamble and title were agreed to.
The Bill was reported as amended.

I do not believe that there is any necessity to
amend clause 5 of the bill to protect transactions
made. in connection with the administration of estates,
between the date of the coming into force of the
Bankruptcv Act on 1st July, 1920 and the date of the
coming into force of the present bill. The effect of
clause 5 will be to attribute a certain quality to
judgments registered prior to the lst July, 1920, but
such qiality wvili only attach to such judgments after
the date of the coming into force of the present bill;
such judgments will not have possessed that quality
until the coming into force of the present bill and
anything done heretofore will not be
consequently
aftected.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But he
overlooks the all-important point that that
quality was not given to the judgment and
will not be until the passage of this Bill;
consequently a judgment would have come
within the bankrupt estate and it could have
been liquidated andi the proceeds distributed
amongst the creditors.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: He claims that
that will have been done legally, inasmuch
as this Bill bas no retroactive effect.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, it
will have been done legally. It is all right
if you are not seeking to restore the status
whi.ch such a judgment hadHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Hon. Mr. DAN'DURAND.

REPORTED

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 115, an
Act to amend the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police Act.
Hon. Mr. Stanfield in the Chair.
On section 1-readjustment of pensions
granted prior to 7th July, 1919:
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: May I remind the
Minister that he said he would tell the Committee what amount of pension would accrue
to a Mounted Police Officer under this change;
that is, how much the individual pension
would amount to in the aggregate.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I gave the total
of the increase. I think it amounted to $27,000 or $28,000 at the peak. Of course it will
come down gradually. The rates are to be
found by looking back at the schedules, which
must be contained in the statute of 1919. We
might perhaps pass the Committee stage, and
at the third reading I will give the honourable
gentleman the information desired.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: It is merely a matter
of curiosity on my part, but I thought I
would like to know.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
There was at
a certain date a schedule based upon the
salaries involved. The salaries were gradually

MAY 19, 1925
increased, and for those members who were
retired subsequently the pensions have increased with them. Those members who took
their pensions prior to 1919 wil1 be brought
up to the level of the new sehedules.
Section 1 wau agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed to.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, before, the Orders of the Day
are proceeded with, *may I say that I, like
most others, have noticed in this morning's
press that my honourable friend from De
Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique) to-day reaches
his eightieth yearHon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: -and his

as a member of the Privy Council.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This is a

complimentied by being told that it was a

that was net. after aIl, a very flattering comnplument. But when it is associated with a
reality as brilliant as that, whieh is cxemplified
in tbe persen of eut boneurable colleague,
that compliment ris so truc tbat it constitutes

ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE
BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading of Bill 115, an Act to amend the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act.
He said: I promised one of my honourable
colleagues certain information on the third
reading of this Bill. I do not know that it
is necessary to put on Hansard the whole list
of the salaries that have been drawn and the
increases in pensions; so I will give the statement to my honourable friend. I stated when
we were in Committee that when this Bill was
passed we would be at the peak of the expenditure. Since that time, unfortunately,
the one who stood at the top of the list, in
a position to enjoy the largest increase, has
died. I will lay on the Table the list of
increases.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.

There is but a

The clause states
that a declaration must be moade that there

have failed.
The amendmoent is made for
the purpoe of covering the case where it has

MAY 27, 1925
before us, we rnay discuss them separately;
but hie will find that the present amendment
bears upon the statutery declaration ta be
made by one of the parties, and if rny lhonourable friend will read the clause carefully he
will sec that this is a most proper amendment.
Han. Mr. REID: I ar n ot going ta abject
ta this particular clause, but 1 only wish ta
draw attention ta the necessity of being ýcarefui in amendments ta labour legisiation.
I
think we should net unnecessarily upset the
working of an Act that bas been going an
with satisfaction for so many years.
Section 2 was agreed to.
On section 3--relation of parties ta remain
unchanged ýpending proceedings before a
Board:
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Is this the clause
that bas 'been twice rejected by the Senate?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No. My hionourable friend is mistaken.
It was carried
last Session, I think quite unanimously. Perhaps rny honourable friend resigned himself
ta seeing it passed, but in Committee there
had been divisions on two clauses, and each
time the majarity of the Senate rallied ta the
principle contained in this clause, and it
reýceived unanimous consent and a third reading.
Hon. Mr. BEAIJBIEN: I arn sarry if I
have misled the Senate: I did flot recolleet
that the clause had passed last year. I know
certainly that it did flot pass without a very
strenuous effort on the part of certain members af this House. 0f course, it goes without
saying that on the third reading it is absolutely useless to begin the fight over again.
I want ta draw attention ta the fact that
it is a perfectly unjust principle. 0f course,
the scope of the Act is limited, and therefore
that injustice will not now be so great as
it was bef are, but the principle is there, and
wherever it operates it is going ta operate
iperfectly well
unj ustly. Everybedy kno"
that it imposes an obligation that ie binding
on one side, and absolutely unbinding upon
the other side. Everybody knows that yeu
cannat, impose upon men, belonging to a
union which is nlot incorporated a legal obligation net to strike--and the uinions in
this country are flot incorporated. T'hat is
an illusion that is put into the statute. On
the other hand, everybody knows that that
clause may operate very unjustly against capital, and I ask, why should we in this House
knowingly create an injustice? Are we obliged
ta, do so?

309

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
gentleman takes for granted that there is an
injustice.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Everybody knows
it. Wiil my heneurable friend contend that
he can hold 10,000 men by a clause in a
statute telling them not te strike? Everybody knows that that clause is absolutely
futile as far as the men are concerned, but
that it aperates ýagainst every corporation.
With this amendment, no corporation will
dare ta change wages, even tbough they bave
geed reasan ýfor doing se, and during that
time they may accumulate goods which they
wili never be able te seil because they were
produced at wages absalutely eut of reasan.
Why is it we are forced to adapt such
legislation? That is what I do net understand.
Again I raise my voice in protest
against tihat kind of thing, which bas coe
before this House .twa or three times. Even
if 1 amn alone I will bave to do 'it. It is
absolutely unfair. We are constantly being
pushed by what is called the voice of the
people. But the voice of the people calîs
for justice, when they analyze the situation.
This clause is flot just, because it qperates
upon only ene party, and I do nat think it
should pass.
I have heard
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
my ihonourable friend before on this clause,
and, although he holds streng viewe, and
expresses them with vigor, hie was defeated
in this Chaniber last year by a vote of 28
ta, 15, which probably shows that there is
another point of view which carried, tihe
maj ority. That point of view is the principle
of equality. Now, rny honourable friend says
that on the face of the Act there is equality.
A most respectable paper, the Montreal
Gazette-which I read every rnorning when I
take rny coffee-said this rnorning:
A new clause in the Bill provides that any employer
dedlaring or causing a lockout or making effective a
change in wages or hours contrary te the provisions of
the Bill shall be liable to a fine of not less than $100
nor more thon $1,000 for each day orepart of a day that
suth lockout or change existe. There is no such penalty
providei in the case of those who cause a strike contrary to the provisions of the Bül.

Well, I arn glad sometimes te find. an errer
in my rnorning gospel, se, that I may feel that
I ar n ot tihe only fallible Persan in the
reali. 0f course, the writer of this article
had the Bilil, and saw tlhat arnendment, but
he did net read the clause in -the Act itself,
which is as follo'ws:
Any exnployee who go-e on strike contrary ta the
provisions of this Act eaoli ho hable ta a fine of not
lee than $10 for mors than $50, for each day or
part of B day that gSuh omnployee, is on uthfloe.

310

SENATE

There needed to be no such amendment
presented in this Bill, because it is already
in the Act.
My honourable friend says there is injustice
in that the employee cannot be reached.
Well, he lias been reached at times, and I
draw attention to the fact that it is a
personal obligation upon eadh of the men.
There have been in all nineteen prosecutions
under the Industrial Disputes Investigation
Act since its enactment. Six of these were
against employers-for alleged illegal lockouts,
breaches of agreement, reduction of wages
prior to dispute being dealt with by Conoiliation Board; ten were against employeesfor alleged illegal strikes, inciting strikes,
aiding strikes, etc.; and in three cases an injunction was sought to restrain Board
procedure.
My honourable friend says the parties have
to remain as they are tili the Board has
made a pronouncement. Whatever the decision of the Board, we all know that it can
be set aside or refused, and then the parties
are free to do as they please. Is there really
an injustice in view of the fact that the
status quo will be maintained pending investigation?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Will it he maintained? That is the question.
lon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The very
essence of this Act is to prevent strikes. It
bas done its work we]l. In 600 cases it
lias prevented strikes. What will happen if
we say that the employer is to be penalized
if lie refuses to maintain the status quo?
Before answering that question I want to
state that the Act as it is on the Statute
Book places an obligation upon the employer
to maintain the status quo; the only thing
that the Act does not say is that he will be
penalized if he disobeys the law. I believe
it is good law to say: "You shall respect
that law: there will be a penalty if you
violate it;" especially when there is a
penalty imposed upon the other party to the
contract.
What will be the situation if we pass this
amendment?
It will be a notice to the
employer that he is to maintain the status
quo. He is the party who decides that he
has to reduce wages or to alter the conditions of a contract; and, knowing that he
must give thirty days notice he can fix his
own date. It is because he can fix his own
date that I sec no injustice in this amendment. He knows that he will have to await
the result of the investigation. He need not
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

violate the spirit of the law: he only nods
to know that he will be penalized. He had
a moral as well as legal obligation under the
Act as it was. Now we say that if he
disobeys that law he will have to pay the
penalty just as the poor employee does. He
will prepare for that contingency, and will
take time by the forelock and give the
necessary notice in order to be free from the
deoision if ilt displeases him.
My honouraible friend has said that we
should leave well enough alone-that we
should net threaten capital. I draw attention to the fact that the Act has received
the commendation of most of the civilized
countries in the world; and if we can perfect
an instrument that guarantees a minimum of
strikes, I think we will have done good work
for the people of Canada. We have been the
pioneers in this kind of legislation. When
moving about Europe a year or two after
the passage of the Act, I found that it was
regarded as a new instrument of peace in
industrial conflicts. I believe we are moving
in the right direction in re-establishing the
Act for use by the Federal authorities, and
establiishing equality between employer and
employee. There was equality in the obligation to maintain the status quo, but there
was inequality 'against the employce in the
penalty imposed. It was decided by a vote
of two to one in this Chamber that there
should be equality between the parties, and
I am quite sure that this clause will net be
rejected after having been passed by such a
vote last Session.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
The honourable
gentleman said a moment ago that this Bill
passed the Senate last Session. That being
se, I would like to ask him why it did not
become law. It was not acceptedHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My honourable
friend is in error. It passed the Senate.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
But it went to
another place and did not pass there.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But it was
not that clause which prevented it passing.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
The honourable
gentleman says this is exac ly the same Bill
as that which we passed last year. Has there
been a change of seul or mind in the other
place that he thinks it is going to pass this
year?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will answer my
honourable friend. Our amendments were not
accepted in the other Chamber last Session
becaus-e there was added by the honourable

MAY 27, 1925

gentleman ffrom Middleton (Hon. W. B. Ross)
an amendmaent transferring the power of 'the
Minister off Labour to choose the umpire on
these arbitration boards to the Chief Justice
of either the Superior Court or the Supreme
Court. It was on that clause that the Bill
failed to receive the ratification of the Commonsý, but the amendment which we are now
di.scussing had passed the Commons. Naturally, -the Minister of Labour bas net introduced the amendment affecting umpires in
thîs Bill. He did flot concur in it wben the
Bill met with 'the refusai of the Commons
upon its return from this Chamber last Session. The presenit amendment, however,
passed the Senate, as it had been passed -by

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Is this -the Act
that was declared ultra vires by the Privy
Council?
Yes.
Hon. Mr. BEATJBIEN:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
This is the
Act that was declared ultra vires in the form
in whieh it is on the Statute Book. In order
te confform te the dictum of the Privy Council
the present amendmaents are before this Chamber.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: That is, the Act
itself was declared ultra vires.
Some off its
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
clauses.
Hon. Mr.. MeMEANS: Only some off its
clauses?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The honourable
gentleman speaks off equality. He says there
is equality between the employer and the
employee. That, is his contention because
there is provision for a fine against the employer and also against the employce. But
how can a, fine be collected from the employee? Perbaps the honourable gentleman
could tell us now how many of tbe thousands
off employees in this country bave ever paid
that fine during the past twenty years?

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I do net know
about tbat. It is onesided legislation: it is
all for one aide and ail against the otber:
it is a case off beada you win and tala I lose.
That is about tbe plain English off it.
Hon. Mr. REID: In taking part in this
discussion, I wish it te be understood 'that
I am net in sympathy with either aide, but
only wisb te see a law on the Statute Book
which will be in the best interest off the
country as a whole. The first part off this
Bill, as I understand it, is for the -purpose off
continuing in force the Industrial Disputes Act
which bas been in operation for so many
years. I think we all agree that tbat Act
ahould be allowed to continue. It has done
good work in tbe past and will continue te do
good work in the future. The Leader off the
Government bas stated that other countries
bave copied the iaw as it bas stood on the
Statute Book for so many years. Tbat is
true, but there has been ne such clause in
the Act as is contained in this Bill.
But there is another side te tbis question.
There are a great many industries in thîs
country te-day that are sailing pretty close te
the wind. At present everything is going
satisffactory with the employers and the employees; but Parliament rnight reduce the
tarif! overnigbt, and censequently an industry
might have te lower wages; yet the employer must give tbirty days notice.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I draw the attention off ry beonourable friend te the fact
that the Act as it stands on the Statute Book
mentions the thirty éays, and even if this
amend'ment is rejected that provision remaina
in the Act. Section 57 off the Act saya:

Hon. Mr. REID: Will the honeurable gentleman read on and tell me if there is provision for a fine off $1,000 a day if the thirty
days notice is net given? That is what I
was discussing just now.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Would my honourable friend keep in mind censtantly the
fact that this law dees net apply te ordinary
industry, but te public utilities that are interprovincial, such as railroads and telegraphs.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: How many employers were fined?

Employers a.nd employeoe sheil give et Ieast thirty
days notice of an intended change affecting conditions
of employjmpnt with respect to ws.ges or bours; and
in the event of such intended change reulting in a
dispute, until the dispute 'hme been finaily dealt with

SENATE

Hon. Mr. REID: If that is ail it applies to,
it is all the greater reason why such a provision should not be in the Bill at all. As
far nis the railwais are concerned. they are
working very satisfactorily; they have a
Board appoi-e:d i ys tihe mlv
and have no
trouble at al!. J do not think the emploiees
or the raile vs have asked to have this clause
put in. When it cones to public utilities
or Government works, then you get in the
thin edge of the wedge, and next Session
you will introduce a Bill to make the law
apply to nanufacturing and other industries
as well. Wetare getting too much legislation
on the Statute Book for the good of the
country as a whole. I think we should go
slowly with this kind of legislation until cither
the employers or the employees act. If they
have not requested or demanded this legislation, we shouîld not insist upon it. Let us
come out into the open, and see whc wants it.
Does the Government want it for its utilities?
I do not believe it. Do the railways want
it? I îlo not think so. I (o not believe that
any Govecrnment, Liberal. Conservative or
Progressive, wants a clause providing for a
penalty of $1.000 a day. As has been said.

from

the

em-

ploiee. That clause was not intcnded for
men walking out. but for those who went out
and did violence. Men who commit acts of
violence shou'd be liable to a fine, but that

should be the only cause; and 1 defy the'
leader of the Government to point to any
other cause. Because a $10 fine is imposed
on an enployee that is no reason why an industry should be made liable to a $1,000 fine.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My hoonourable
friend seems to be frightened at the $1,000
clause. I would draw his attention to the
fact that the Act now on the Statute Book
provides for that penalty. I will read it to
my honourable friend:
58. Any em;ployer declaring or causing a Iockout
contrary te the provisions of tris Act shall be liable
to a fine of net less than one hundred dollars, nor
more than one thousand dollars for each day or
part of a day that such lockout exista.

He will find that the change now made is
to add the words, "or making effective a
change in wages or hours."
58. Any employer declaring or causing a lockout or
making effective a change in wage or hours contrary
te the provisions of this Act shall be liable to a
fine of not less than one hundred dollars, nor more
than one thousand dollars, for esch day or part of
a day that such lockout or change exista.

The words "or change" are also

My
friend will sec the reason. It is
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

new words.
Why were
honourable
because in

1907 wages were generally low, and the effort
was to inerease them. Nobody ever thought
that there iwould come such a change in economic conditions that the employer would at a
certain time declare his intention to reduce
w-ares. It was inconceivable in 1907 that the
employer would be in a position to impose
such a reduction. Now the tables are turned
the situation is altered. Labour has obtained
increased wages. In some cases, I believe,
tho-e wages should be reduced. I do not think
that ali the rates increased during the war because of spcial conditions and higher cost of
living should remain up in the air. But my
boonourable friend has now the reason why a
little change is made.
All that could be
imagined on the part of the employer was a
lockout. not a reduction of vages. It was
the other party who was fighting for a change
in the wages. Noa'w that they are to be reduced, there must be a penalty imposed on
anyonc who reduces wages without conforming
to the present Act, which declares that pending the reference to a Board, the status quo
shall be maintained. That is all.
Hon. Mr. REID: I would like a little further explanation. The Act that the honourable
leader has been citing applies to all industries,
I suppose.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No, only to
public utilities. That is ail there is under the
Industrial Disputes Investigation Act.
Hon. Mr. REID:
As I understood the
honourable Senator from Welland (Hon. Mr.
Robertson), be stated that it was to apply only
to railways and public utilities.
Hon. Mr. CASCRAIN:

And mines.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
We have passed
the first clauses of this amending Bill. They
revive the Federal power to apply the Industrial Disputes Investigation Act to matters
that come under Federal jurisdiction, inasmuch as the ,Privy Council bas declared that
we cannot invade provincial jurisdiction and
that we must limit our actions to the Federal
sphere.
Hon. Mr. REID: The Industrial Disputes
Investigation Act that was before the Privy
Council, as I remember the Act, applied to
all industries that were under the jurisdiction of the Dominion Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No. My honourable friend is in error.

The provisions of this Act shall be construed as
relating only to the appliiction of the Industrial
Disputes Investigation Act, 1907, and not so as to

by section two, paragraph (c), of the said Act.

What is an "employer"?

provisions shall be construed as relating only

What does

"employer" mean?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND (reading):
"Employer" means any person, company or corporation employing ten or more persons and owning or

whether operated by steaa, eleotricity or other
motive power, steamships, telegraph and telephone
lines, gas, electric light, water and power works, or
any number of such persons, companies or corporations aeting together, or who in the opinion of the
Minister have interests in common.

That last part
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
seemas to be pretty wide.
Hon. L. C. WEBSTER: That is very wide.
How does my
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
honourable friend interpret that last part of
the paragraph? Is it restricted by the first
part?
It means a
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
group. I would not like to hurt the feelings
of my honourable friend-dt means a merger,
for instance, or a trust. So it is extended
beyond the individual utility.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I presume
to draw my honourable friend's attention to
this fact, that under the operation of the
Act in the past a dispute might extend over
a number of coal mines, for example, within,
say, the province of Nova Scotia-perhaps
over 26 or 30 of them. They had interests
in common. Under that clause, or the interpretation of that clause, it was possible to
establish one Board of Conciliation to deal
with a dispute involving al the employers,
although there was in that case probably no
merger existing.
Or it would
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
cover the Shipping Federation.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes.
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: Would it cover the
boot and shoe dndustry?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: -No.
No; because
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
there are so many people who are shoeless
it is not an absolute necessity. A public
utility is a service in which a third party,
the public, is vitally interested, and it is
to protect the public against conflicts from
which dt might suffer that this Act has come
into force.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Answering directly
the honourable member from Welland, I may
say that any mine, in any province, incorporated by letters patent, would evidently fall
immediately under the scope of this law.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Prior to the
Privy Council's decision.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Any dispute in

My honourable friend can see how wide is
the scope of this Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I believe that
every honourable meriher in this Chamber
will feel that it is the duty of the Dominion
Government and the authorities to see that
this Act applies to ýany works that ýcorne under
federal jurisdliction. My honourable friend
forgets that it is of great importance to maintain Iaw, order and prosperity throuýghout the
country, and strikes bring pýrosperity te, no
one. The good effect of this Act bas been
te prevent strikes and loekouts. Furthermore,
we have passed that stage of the Bill; we
are now on clause 3.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEýN: But my honourable friend forgets altogether that the law
which he now claims bas done such good
service nover had in it the provision which
he now wants to introduce by this amendment.
Hon. Mr. DA'NDIJRAND: The conditions
are new.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Se wbat you had
hefore was realiy a conciliation law; nobody
was constrained; and therein lay its virtue.
Hon. Mr. DANDIJIIAND: But my honourable friend is in error.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I will refer to that
in a moment. The parties were brought together and urg-ed to have a conciliatory conference. Thore was ne big stick in sight at
ail. That is where the Act really served the
purpose for which it was passed. But now
what are vou doing? My honourable friend
says, 'We already have an obligation in the
law, and we are strongthoning that obligation."
You had put into the statute an oligation
which did flot operate either one way or the
other. Both parties were absolutoly indiffercnt te it; therefore, the law remained in
spirit, as it wvas first enacted, a conciliation
moasure. There was in it ne constraint at
ail. But now you are changing it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Aitering it.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: You had a clause
that nominally imposed an obligation, but
in reality did not. Therefore the law was
nothing- but a conciliation law. But, as I
statod last year to this Housse. you are puttimg
teeth into it. That is whýat you are going
te do.
Hon. 'Mr. ROBERTSON.

Hon. MT. DANDURAND:
There must be
respect for the law.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: And you are very
careful that tlhey shahl be used enly on one
side.
Hon. Mr. DANDIURAND:
No. I invite
my honourable friend te read section 59.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I wi'l put this
case befere xny honourable friend. There are
probably 50,000 or 60,000 employees on the
railways of Canada at present; perhaps more.
If a strike were calleýd to-morrow without
notice, would my honourable friend contend
before this House that it would be at ail
possible te impose, or think of imposing, a
fine on any one of those fifty or sixty thousand mon? Why, it would net oven enter bis
mind; he would repel any such thought.
Hon. Mr. DANDIJRAND: If thoy acted
iiiegally?
Hon. Mr. BEAUTBIEN: Yos, if they went
on strike. Since the inception of the law
there have beon six of such cases-six as
com.pared with 500,000 werkmon in Canada.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
Because they
did net violate the law.
Hon. Mr. BEAIIBIEN:
'Six cases in
twenty years. And m3X honourablo friend
knows that absolute violation of that law
toek place, net once, but many times.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: On the railroads?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: No, net on the railroads. After this morning's session of the
Committoe everybody knows that there ceuid
net po.ssibly ho a strike on the railways. We
know how the charge for wages on the rai!wvays bas jumped in the last few years from
about thirty millions te seventy-five millions
-an increase of 250 per cent. De von think

it is possible for the workors on the railways
te strike? No; net until such time as the
people get hungry and have te go te these
gentlemen and ask them te be kind enough te
reduce their wages. I do net know what wvii1
happen thon. Wilh the Goveroment dare te
have the teeth of this Bill applied te the 60,000 werkers on the raiiways? I would hike te
sec the Goveroment that would dare te do
that. But the teeth will ho applied te capital,
because capital is something anonymous. AIthough it dees reprcsent thousands and thonsands of poor people, as well as of rich, it is
a thing that you cao strike at and that des
net str:ke back, because it dees net vote au

doos the man in the street. That is why such
extraordinary thin.-s happen. There are mon-

MAY 27, 1925
talities that are just and fair under ordinary
circumstances, but flot when compariug
numbers on one aide with what I might
eall quality on the other. When you have
500,000 workmen on the one fiand and perhaps 5,000 corporations on the other, there
can be for the Clovernment no other decision
than to aide with the .500,000 votera. That ia
the rule. If this case were submitted to a
jury composed of judges, .my contention ia that
witbin half an hour they would ask the Government: "Is that clause hinding on the workmen? Can you assure us that it is?" The
Government could flot say that -it is binding,
for it is flot. The judges would say: "We
shall wait until you find a method whereby
this Act can be enforced justly on bath sides;
then corne back te us." That is 'what would
happen. But we have no such mentality teday, unfortunately. I regret it. But I would
point out to my honourable friend that the
scope of this law is much wider than he thinks.
It applies to every corporation that is called
an employer under the clauses which he has
cited, and incorporated either by Act of Parliament or by letters patent from the Department of State of Canada. That is a very
wide scope indeed.
lion. SMEATON WHITE: I would like to
ask my honourable friend what he und!erstands by the words "go on strike "?
Hon. Mr. DANDURANID: My honourable
friend will find it in the interpretation, clause:
"Strike" or "«to go on strike" (without limiting the
nature of its meaning) means the cessation of work
by a body of employees acting in combination, or a
concerted refusai or a refusai under a conimon understanding of any num'ner of empioyees to continue to
work for an employer, in consequence of a dispute,
dlone as a incans of compelling their employer, or to
aid other exnployees in compelling their employer, te
accept terme of esnployment.

Hon. Mr. REID: I would like a littIe
better explanation as to the application of
this Act to railways and public utilities. I
have read the Act, and must confesa that I
think it takes in ail industries. Paragraph e
of subsection 2A is as follows:
This Act shail apply to the following disputes Only:
(e) works, undertakings or business belonging td,
carried on or operated by aliens, Entiuding foreign
corporations iminigratmng tato Canada to ciarry On
busins;

I take it that that clause would apply to
any industry, say in the United States, that
might have or wish to establish a branch in
Canada. Miglit not the clause juat quoted
apply to public utilities such as are mentioned in paragraph g:
<g) works, undertakings or business cf any cosnpany

or corporation incorporated by or under the authority
of the Parliainent of Canada.

315

I take this clause to mean that if any comnpany got a charter through the Parliament
of Canada, this Act would apply to it. But
it goes further and says: "by or under the
authority of the Parliament of Canada." As
the Parliament of Canada has given power
to the Secretary of State *to issue charters to
corporations without an Act of Parliament.
this Act would apply to every company that
holds a Dominion charter.
But it goes further still. There are
thousands of companies incorporated by the
provincial legislatures, and the idea is to get
after them as well. Subsection iv reads this
way:
(iv) Any dispute which is within the exclusive
leislative jurisdiction of any province and which by
the legislation of the province is macle atibject to
the provisions cf this Act.

In other words, as I interpret this clause,
it means that every company or employer of
labour that has invested money in any industry incorporated. under an Act of 'the Parliament of Canada will be subject to this
Act. It goes furth.er than railway corporations. They want to make this apply also to
the provinces, and that raises serious problems, for there may be political questions in
the provinces that will interfere. 1 would
like the leader of the Government to tell me
in what respect my interpretaýtion is wrong.
Hon. Mr. DANDTTRAND: My honourable
friend will notice that new section 2B limita
the operation of this amendment to the employer as defined by the Industrial Disputes
Act of 1907:
2B. The provisions of this Act shail ha conetrued
as relating only -te the application of The Industriel
Disputes Investigation Act, 1907, and net so as ta
extend the meaning of the word "employer" s
defined by section two, Paragnaph (c), of the said
Act.

My bonourable friend will have to look to
the Act itself to find what the word "employer" means, and he will tbere find that
the provision applies only te public utilities.
Mr. REID: Then we have a1l those other
clauses.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend will have to read clause 2A, which
says:
2A. (1) This Act srhall saply to the follomwing dispute

slept over this Bill and thought it out carefully they may bring some very good arguments.

Hon. Mr. REID: As it will be impossible
to get througli tiis Act this afternoon, I
would suggest that the honourable leader
would agree to let it stand until to-morrow.
It is a very important Act, and should be
carefully considered.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: But after speaking
to one another they might to-morrow enlighten
this Goverrnent, though I do not say it needs
any enlightenment.
However, I have just
received a very important letter.
There bas
been complaint that we have not had enough
to do tiis Session, and I think we should enjoy a discussion.
The word "parlement,"
in French, means a place where we talk, and
we oughtt t have a little more to say here.
This letter is fron the Canadian Institute
of Mining and Metallurgy:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I think my
honourable friend will sympathize with me
when I tell him that, if he has given us all
the light that he possesses on this clause,
there would be greater danger in adjourning
the matter until to-morrow.
New members
will come in and put the sarne questions that
have been put, and at 5 o'clock we will be
asked to adjourn for another day, when
we will have another set of Senators
who will ask the sarne questions.
I have
seen that in the House of Commons.
One
evening, from 8 o'clock till 12, the then Minister of Justice, Right Hon. C. J. Doherty,
had to answer ten times the inquiries that
were put to hirn on an Act, and I could sec
gentlemen corne in and hear them say: "Unfortunately I was not here when the honourable gentleman gave bis explanation;" so the
questioning would start again.
If my honourable friend bas about exhausted his arguments, will he not allow us to go out of
Committee, and take the third reading tomorrow?
Hon. Mr. REID: Of course, I sympathize
with the honourable leader, but at the sarne
time I object very strongly that when an
important Bill like this comes before us we
are expected to put it through simply as a
rubber stamp. I think it should be discussed
thoroughly.
We have plenty of time, even
if it should take till the day after to-morrow.
The honourable leader says that other Senators
will be coming in.
I think every Senator in
this Chamber should have all the light that
can be thrown on this legislation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But it is the
duty of every Senator to be in his seat.
Hon. Mr. REID: Certainly it is, but there
are particular times when every Senator cannot be here.
A Bill like this should not be
rushed through hurriedly.
I have not exhausted all I have to say on it; but if the
honourable leader wishes to go ahead I am
willing.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I really believe
that the honourable gentleman is quite right.
When the members of this House will have

May 23rd, 1925.
Honourable J. P. B. Casgrain,
The Sonate of Canada,
Ottawa, Ontario.
Dear Sir:
The Executive of the Institute have noted with
regret that Bill No. 25 "An Act to Amend the
Industrial Disputes Act 1907" bas again passed the
House of Commons and will shortly conte before
the Senate.
You may renenber that we wrote you on June
10th, 1924, protesting against the Bill and recorded
several well founded objections of both the mine
operators and this Institute.
Since that date there have been no developments
in any way influencing the Institute's Executive to
change its recorded opinion of last year. In fact,
the passing of this Bill during the present disturbed
industrial conditions of the countrv would be most
detrimental and we respectfully ask that the Bill be
carefully studied before it is endorsed.
Representatives of both the Institute and mine
operators would be glad of the opportunity of appearing before you in Ottawa in case further information
is desired.
Yours faithfully,
Geo. C. Mackenzie,
Secretary-Treasurer.

Surely, in an instance like this, the discussion migit be postponed until another day.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
Only last night
I incidentally found that this very Institute,
whiei bas been in the habit of religiously
opposing this Bill for years past, have not
engaged their usual medium to represent their
case here, because they say that they are
not concerned, since the decision of the
Privy Council exempts provincial organizations, such as a local mining company, from
the operation of this Act.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Will Cape Breton
be in this Act?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Cape Breton is
in it. That is why the Federal Government
have said "Hands off," and have lain down
and done nothing in connection with the
lamentable situation which now exists in

MAY 27, 1925
Nova Scotia. They Say: "We have no responisibility."
May 1 point out to my honourable friend
from Grenville (Hon. Mr. Reid) that the
amendments involved in this Bill have been
passed by both Houses ini two preceding years,
and on each of those occasions they were
thoroughly discussed in this House in detail.
1 rather agree with my honourable friend the
leader of the Gove'rnment that it, is quite
unnecessary to continue going over the points
that we have disposed of on two previous
occasions, and axe asked now to re-endorse.
Hon. L. C. WEBSTER: May I ask the
honourable leader whether the following subsection would apply to the coal mines:
(iii) Any dispute which the Governor ini Couneil

of the Privy Council says it shou1d apply.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: In that case it
applies to anything and everything. In order
not to stay under any f aise impression, I
would ]ike to put a plain, straiglit question
to the Government; whether this amendment
applies or does not apply to local mining in
the different provinces by companies incorporated under letters patent or Act of Parliament of the Dominion. Would the honourable gentleman from Welland put that question? If not, I wilI put it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I should be glad
to have týhe honourable gentleman put the
question if hie desires. In my judgment it
is wholly unnecessary to, ask the question.
Under subsection iii the Governor in Council
may declare any industry to be a public
utility within the meaning of the Act if an
emergency exists. I think that if I were
an employer, in that case I would object to
a Board being appointed, and would do
exactly as the Hydro-Electric Commission did
last year, and I would be suppoi'ted by the
courts and by the Privy Council. I tliink
this is a fool proposition, and a fool clause
in the BI'1; but it does not affect the administration of the law so far as the administrator of that law keeps within it; t¶herefore
the clause can do no harm, and I amn not
worrying about it. I tbink it is wholly unneoessary. The employer bas bis protection
at ali times.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Wiil the honourable leader answer my question-because I
see the honourable gentleman from Welland,
as usual, has kept away from it: it was not
a question with which hie was sympathetie.

317

My question is simply this: under paragraph (g) of section 2A it is quite evident
that the Act will apply to disputes in works,
undertaýkings, or business of any company or
corporation inýcorporated by or under the
authority of the Parliament of Canada-that
is the flrst qualification, so to speak; and the
second, my honourable friend says, is the
restriction in the word "employer." I want
to know if a mine încorporated by letters
patent in Ottawa, but functionjing wholly in
one province, would faîl under the scope of
the Industrial Disputes Act as amended.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Refer it
to the Privy Gouncil.
Hon. Mr. BEATYBIEN: No: I can get a
straîght answer from my honourable friend,
the leader of the Hlouse. If I did flot know
that hie would give me such an answer, I
would not put the question to him. I know
I arn going to bave a straight answer.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is it from me?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Yes, of course: I
amn waiting.
AIl I can tell
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
my honourable friend is that this text cornes
to, me from the House of Gommons. It was
presented in that House by the Minister
of Labour, and supported by the Minister
The Department of Justice
of Justice.
declared it to be on ail fours with the
judgment of the Privy Council. I present it
as I received it from the Departmýent of
Justice, with the sanction of that Department. My honourable friend will not surely
ask me to give my personall opinion upon the
extent of some of these clauses. I mýay Say
that I have my own fear as to the application of one of thern; but, as the honourable
gentleman from Welland (Hon. Mr. Robertson) savs, it is in the Act; it will surely
serve a ýgood purpose if there is a difference
of opinion on its lýegal aspect and it is tested
in the courts! I rnight not like to say that
the Privy Council would be wrong 'if it
declared that we ýare going beyond the
authority of the Parliament of Canada in sorne
respects in this Bill. I bave rny fears as to
a certain aspect of the Act, but I believe
it is most important that the Federal authorities should be clothed with power to prevent
strikes in a field which, generally, is its field,
and for thýat purpose I cornmend the Act
to the Senate.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: 1 humbly beg -the
pardon of this House and of the honourable

318

SENATE

gentleman for having put my question so
obscurely that the honourable gentleman could
not answer it. I thought my question was
plain, but I am going to repeat it again. If
there is any trouble in a mine incorporated
at Ottawa, will that mine fall within the scope
of the Industrial Disputes Act? If my honourable friend has any doubt, perhaps he can
get some information not very far from him.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I think I heard
my honourable friend make a similar request
on several occasions last Session.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It would fall
under paragraph g of the first section:

Hon. Mr. GORDON:
But the penalty
which will be enforced under clause 4 is a
new one. There was no such penalty as that
in the old Act.

Works, undertakings or business of any company or
corporation incorporated by or under the authority of
the Parliament of Canada.

Hon. Mr. REID: I would like to ask the
honourable gentleman why that would not
apply to an industry?
Hon. Mr. DANDUJRAND:
Because the
scope of the Act is limited. The Bill mentions mines as oublic utilities. If my honourable friend will read clause 1 of the Bill
he will find descriptions of most of the utilities covered. There may be others which are
not mentioned. but which fall under the general declaration.
Hon. Mr. GORDON:
Honourable gentlemen, I was very much concerned about the
insertion of this clause in the Bill of last
year, and I remember very distinctly that the
information which I got from the leader of
the House at that time was that it would
cover all mines. We all know that in Northern Ontario and Quebec there is to-day a
great mining development; and if this Act
is to apply to companies employing ten men
or more it is going to operate very adversely
on many small companies which are in process of development. Suppose to-morrow an
owner were under the impression that he
could no longer pay the wages which he had
been paying in order to show that he had
a mine, and he decided that he had to close
down or pay his men less, under this provision he would have to continue paying his
men the wage which they had been receiving.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
he hadn't the money?

How could he if

Hon. Mr. REID: Borrow it from the Govarnment.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: That is the point
I am trying to bring out. If this clause is
left in the Act, it is going to retard the development of that country very materially,
and I think the Government would be well
advised to withdraw it.
Hon. L. C. WEBSTER:
May I suggest
to my honourable friend that we might postpone this discussion until to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

Hon. L. C. WEBSTER:
courteously received.

And it was always

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I draw attention to the fact that the amendinents do not
alter the position of these miners.

Hon. ?Mr. DANDURAND:
the same.
Hon. Mr. GORDON:

The penaly is

Why re-enact it?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
law clearer.

To make the

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: What would happen to some of those miners if they did not
have the $1,000? Many of them have net got
it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Surely my
honourable friend realizes that since 1907 this
Act bas been applied in a humane and intelligent way, and that there have been no such
cases as the honourable gentleman cites. One
may imagine all sorts of cases, but in the general application of this Act there has been no
cruelty to any of these small companies. It
is for the general advantage of Canada to
maintain peace and order between capital and
labour. The case my honourable friend speaks
of would hardly be one in which there was
capital.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
May we ask the
honourable gentleman to adjourn this matter
until to-morrow. There is a more serious
question involved, namely, the constitutionality of the law.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
If my honourable friend wants to adjourn on that point,
I would suggest that we should sit to-night.
We would not settle that question until three
o'clock to-morrow morning.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I do net know that
we need impose upon ourselves night work
at this stage of the Session. What is the
hurry to get this Bill through? After all,
this is a very serious matter. The operation
of this law is going to govern companies doing
business exclusively in a Province. Supposing a mine in the Province of Quebec has been
incorporated under 'letters patent of the
Federal Government, and there is troublea dispute between labour and capital, a strike-

MAY 27, 1925
immediately the Federal Government will say
the law applies. In my opinion, it would not
apply, because there will be a question purely
and simply of civil law, as to whether or not
the contract binding the men to the company
and the company to the men, which is exclusively a civil contract, falls under Federal
or Provincial jurisdiction. My opinion is that
it would fall under Provincial jurisdiction, and
the Privy Council has so stated.

Still, it is

quite evident that this law can be interpreted
as extending to such a case.
We are here to revise. We told ithe Government that two years ago, but it took no heed.
What was the result? The result was that the
Bill was thrown out. We do not want to pass
unconstitutional law: why should we hurry
this through?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I draw attention
to the fact that the whole question of constitutionality is contained in clause 2. We
are now reviewing an old friend. My honourable friend and I have each made half-a-dozen
speeches on the clause which is now under review, and must have ocoupied six or eight
hours. If he wants to discuss the constitutionality of the Act, he can do so now only on
the third reading. Kindly allow me to move
the adoption of clause 3, which is the clause
under discussion, and upon which we voted
twice two years ago-in Committee and on the
third reading-and on which we voted last
year. Surely the Senate will have no more
light on this clause to-morrow than it has at
present. I am sure my honourable friend does
not wish to impose upon the one who has
to explain this clause a repetition of what
we have just had.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I do not want to
bore the House, but my honourable friend
will understand that clause 3 makes the whole
law objectionable. Without clause 3 it is
innocuous. I am drawing the attention of the
Government to the consequences of that
clause. You are putting the teeth in now and
are driving them in where you have no jurisdiction-in every Province. Why should you
do that?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We did it last
year.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: And the Privy
Council told you you were wrong. ,
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, but not on
the principle contained in this clause, because
there is very little in it. The Act said that if
an employer caused a lockout, he was liable
to a penalty up to $1,000; now we say that if
he changes conditions in wages or hours, he

319

is liable to a penalty. That is all. It is the
same thing, because the change may bring
about a lockout. We are clarifying the situation, and it seems to me that after the long
discussion we have had the Senate should
be ready for a vote.
Section 3 was agreed to.
Section 4 was agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed to.
The Bil was reported.

second reading of Bill 69, an Act respecting
the construction of a line of railway forming
part of the Canadian National Railways between Turtleford and a point in Township
48, range 12, west of the Third Meridian in
the Province of Saskatchewan.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I should
like some information in reference to these
two railway Bills, namely, the extent to which
the Government of the Province of Saskatchewan proposes to subsidize these roads. I
understand that substantial assistance is being
proposed by that Government.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Why not let those two
Bills stand until to-morrow?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think perhaps
we could take the second reading. Then I
can get ail the information my honourable
friend desires.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is in
the schedule, but we tan discuss it to-morrow
and show what the Senate accomplished last
Session.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend will not forget that the subsidies were
available last year.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Minister
from Saskatchewan, and others from that
Province who spoke in the Committee, said
the money was in the bank.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, yes,
but it was not progered by the Governiment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, I think it
was. I offered it, but it was in Committee.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, but
you had no control over the funds.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second

He said: Honourable gentlemen, this Bill
amends the Special War Revenue Act of 1915.
whichi co\ ors considerable ground. I would
su 'zaest that we take the second reading, and,
althougb it may be that we could take the

arnend this Bill without reducing the revenue,
which is flot within our jurisdiction, or increisinz the charge upon the people-I think
we may take the Committee stage, in order
tbat the Senate may have the advantage of
explanations which it has a rigýht to have on
each and every clause of this Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

On section 2-Stamp Tex on buis payable
on lumoind, etc., or drawn on person outside
of C:usa.da:
Hon. Mý,r. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gnntlomon wili notice the w ords that are now,
as they are underlined.

These are the new woî'ds-or if a bilt of excliange transferred or detivered to
a bank or i-,ued bv a bank is d,.swn uipon a vers ii
outside of Canada according to rlie telor of the bill

and the clause continues-such

ulceined t0 ho drawn for ai atuuunt flot exceeding twenty-five hundred dollars.
Tise prtipose of tic amendmouet is to make
the xsa-xitssutnss tairp tax on fotoign buis one
dollar. Tbe tax on suria buis, iinsposed by
section 3 (as), i.. nut liirnited to any msaximutm.
Thore bcing nu msaximums i-xd for foreign
buis of exciange, the unlimited tax
tended to cause a transfer of deposits or
moncys outside of Canada if buminess had to
be dune outside of this country-say, in the
United States-and large sums were to ho
transferred. The amount payable in stamps
on S100,000 would bc $40. Parties dealing ina
suci large suins îvould naturally try to save
the ffl as often as possible by opening an
arrount in a foreign country. The consequence was tbat in fla crase of large operations Canada lost not only the ordinary tax,
but also the deposit, whica was made in the
foi'eign country to meot obligations arisiýng
thiete.
Thus the hanks end the publie in
Canada w'ere depi'ived of the advantage of
Iraintg those suins remain in f bis country.
Tise obieet of the proposed aneondment is

of exehange to an amount not exreeding what

MAY 28, 1925
Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP: Can the lioncurable gentleman tell us wliat is the total
amount received annuelly tlirough the stamp
tax on clieques?
The revenue
Hon. Mr. DANDURANID:
fromn stamps, including cheques embossed, for
1924 was $8,771,285.15, and for 1925 was $9,324,455.36.
Hon. Mr. GORTXN: I presume thiat includes stamps on notes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No. It does
on receipts.
Hon. Mr. GORDOiN: While I am on my
feet, I would like to say a word regarding- the
tax which is imposed upon notes. Under the
Act as it now stands the maximum stamp
placed on any cheque is $2.
It is $1 on
Hon. Mr. DAN'DURAND:
cheques.
Hlon. Mr. CORDON: The maximum, then,
is $1. On notes, as I understand, the stamp
tex is 4 cents for every $100.
Hon. Mr. DA'NDURAND: And unlimited.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Is there any reason
for this? A borrower, on $10,000, would liave
te pay $4; on $100.000 he would have to pay
$40, and on a million the amount payable in
stamps would be $400. But the man wlio
lends the money is required to, pay a maximum
of only $1, even to a million-dollar cheque.
I would like to ascertain if tliere is eny reasen
et all for this difference.
Hon. Mr. DANDIJRAND: 1 would say,
offhand, that tlie division wlidl my lionourable friend makes is not absolu.tely a truc
one.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Wliy net?
Tlie lender
Hon. Mr. DANDU'RAND:
likely bas to bear a part of tlie load of tlie
borrower. It is true that the person giving
a note may pay $400, *liereas the man who
issues bis cheque for a million dollars bas to
pay a tex of only $1, but it is question wlio
really carnies the heavier part of the load.
This is* an economfic proposition which I amn
net ready te discuss.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Is my
honourable friend awere of any cases in whidli
the maker of a note is able te dictate te, the
beneficiary wlio shaîl pay the stamp tax? It
seems te me tliat thîs tex is imposed in inverse ratio of the ability te pay. Tliat is te
say, the man wlio cen issue lis clieque witheut any diffcculty is required te pay the least
tex, namely, 81, and the sky-line le the limit

of the chieque, but when some poor unf ortunate is squeezed and has to give a promissory note he lias to pay 4 cents on every
$100. That, means that in addition to the
pound of flesh whicli he must deliver to the
creditor lie lias tu pay a tax on the pound of
flesl.
Hon. J. H. ROSS: It is ail wrong.
My honýourHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
able friend (Hon. Sir James Loug-heed) asks
if there are any cases in which the borrower
may haive part of these charges absorbed by
the lender. 0f course 1 was dealing in large
sums, because the honourable gentlemen
from Nipissing (Hon. Mr. Gordon) lied
spoken of a million.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That only
intens~ifies the difficulty.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Tlie person who
borrows a million will not mind paying a few
dollars more wlien lie issues lis debentures or
issues bis note, with bis collaterals.
1 have asked the Department for an explanation of the reason wliy thie demand and
caîl loans or notes pay more than the chieques.
This is a question of policy which weuld bave
to be discussed on a liiglier plane. I confess
thet I have been myseif at a loss to understand the reel cause for that division in
taxation. Is it because-and probably this
would be a good reason, a determining factor
-the cheque is a document t-bat figures in
the daily aftairs of thie people, and wliereas
thousands of cheques are issued, only very
few premissery notes are signed, and for that
reason the eheque mu.st be treated less severely? I cannot say. I confess I bave not
yet been able to leern a reason that satisfies
me.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Better let
this clause stand.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: No person cin ýgive
a better reason, at times, than my honourable
friend, but I must assure hlm thet hie bam not
given any reason at all why this distinction
sbould býe continued. Every year since the
Act came into force I have asked the same
question. It is absolutely rîdiculous to suppose that the borrower is in a better position
to pay a tex than the lender. My lionourable
friend intiniates that there are not very many
1
notes given, but I arn sorry te have to tel
hlm tihat in this country, especially in these
times, there are thousands of notes given
every day.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, tlioy
are a very popular institution.

MAY 28, 1925
A small concession is now made-if you do
not mind me saying a word about it before
we come to that clause-in exemptinig cheques
of $5 and under from taxation. In my opinion
that is sta.rting the wrong way. I think there
is no way in which revenue can be more easily
collected than by a smali stamp tax, but it
should be don' in an equitable way, and I
think that, instead of doing away with the tax
on cieques of $5 and under, more could be
accomplished by placing the borrower on a
par with the lender.
Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP: My honourable friend attempted to juetify the position
of the Government in charging a heavier tax
on notes than on cheques by what had been
done in England for two or three centuries.
I would draw my honourable friend's attention to the fact that in England the stamp
tax is four cents. twopence, regarddess of whether the cheque is for a few shillings or for a
million pounds. That simplifies the whole
siftuation.
Somene said a moment ago that necessity
caused the Government to do certain things.
I may say that this kind of taxation-two
cents on a choque of $50, four cents on a
cheque of $51, and six cents on a cheque of
$101-is one of the most complicated and
annoying kinids of taxation that we have, and
there is no precedent for it in England or anywhere else that I know of. I hope the Government will find some way out of this kind of
taxation, which in some parts of the country
is regarded as nuisance taxation. If you had
a snall tax equal to that in 'Great Britain,
and it applied to ail amounts, the situation
would not be so unsatisfactory; but people
who do not rely on clerks and offices to do
their work for them forget the right amount
to put on, and the bank complains of having
to charge up two cents, four cents, six cents,
and so on. At the time the tax was adopted
I thought it unwise, and I hope the Government will take the earliest opportunity of
getting rid of it.
I understand that overdrafts in banks pay
a higher tax than cheques. Is that so? If
a man is unfortunate enough to overdraw his
account in the bank, how much is he charged
for it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Four ýcents per
hundred. It is the same principle, but it is
unlimited. The tax on cheques is limited to
one dollar.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: There is another matter that I would like to call attention to. When
this stamp tax was first imposed, one was ailowed to pay it with either revenue stamps
or postage stamps. Just prior to 1878 there

3n

was a stamp tax which. before it was ajbolished,
was changed to allow a man to use either
postage stamps or revenue stamps. I remember very well at the time hearing a great
many express the opinion that that was a great
convenience to the public. When the present
tax was put into effect during the war it was
provided that one could use either postage
stamps or revenue stamps, and I remember
saying to Sir Thomas White that I thought
that was a good provision in view of the experience that I had had of the old Act. I can
see only one reason why the law has been
changed to require revenue stamps to be used
instead of postage stamps: I suppose it is
in order to find out exactly what is being got
from it. But now that that is known pretty
well. why not change it? It would be a great
convenience to the public. In the last three
months there have been times when I could
not get revenue stamps. Some of the drug
stores and book stores keep postage stanps,
but they do not keep revenue stamps. and
there are times when they are verv hard to
get. and a regular nuisance. I would like the
honourable gentleman to take the Cabinet
under his careful guidance some day, and try
to induce them to go back to the system we
had a few years ago under which a man could
use either postage stamps or revenue stamps.
Hon. Mr. DANDTRAND: I may inform
the honourable gentleman that from the very
beginning I have been of the opinion that the
use of a stamp other than an ordinary postage
starmp would be of very great inconvenience
to the public. The argument of the Minister
of Customs was that we would not know
what th? tax brouglit in. But there was also
another argument which had to be taken into
consideration. The Post Office is an immense
Department that tends to increase constantly;
in that Dcpartment expenditure can be added
to by a change in the scale of postage, in
transportation, in deliveries of all kinds, and
it is most important that such a Department,
which is capable of such formidable developnient in expenditure, should know whvat it
produces.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: But do you not know
enough now from your experience and your
receipts uider the Revenue Stamp Tax to be
able to keep the Post Office where it belongs?
There is a
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
modus eperandi which I think would satisfy
my honourable friend. It would be to convince the Postmaster General that every post
office should have excise stamps as well as
postage stamps at the disposal of the public.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: That would help a great
deal.

SEN;ATE

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: In dealing with the
quecstion cf taxation gencrally, il seefls te
mic of cons-iderýable importance that the
rev enue clerix ed sbuuld be traced to its source.
We are going to be paying taxes on a large
scaeil fnr, a long time, and only experience
and tir.iv xviii abow xxhere the taxation can
bcst be borne, that jý, if it can continue to be
borne bei tel in one place than in anothor. I
do net see how a policy can be applied to
the ncce,Àî-iies of the case from lime le time
unlesý a close scrtîtiny is kept of the sources
of the revenue and of the arnounit derived from
each different, source. I think that to-day
revenue is being dcrivcd from sources that
e îu ilI Lffurd te be taxed, wbile there are
other <ources fruni which more should be got.
It ýýeeins to me that these different sources of
revenuie sbeuld be scrutinized and ana lyzed

Hon. W. B. ROSS: I would like to ask the

potmnasier paid a percentage on the ameunt
cf stamps that hie seUîs-net only postage
stamps, but revenue stamps?
Hun. Mr. DANDURAND: In certain cases
he is. Tbere are txxo or three classes of post,
officeis. There is une class in whieh the pustmaster niakes a little commissiun on the sale
uf stamps. At prescut ho does net selI excise
..tamips. The Pe.stmastLer General wvas afraid
at the outset that the excise stamp would be
put on Jotors, and that confusion would
ensue; but, after the general use of the excise
sîamp. prubably he cuuld be reconciled te
the idea of offering that facility te the people
at large.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: If you go back far
enoughi in the ,eventies and eighties, I think
yen xxill find that net only were pestmasters
aïl!oxxd a. comsmission on the sale of stamps,
but that druggists and booksellers ceuld buy
say $100 werth of staimps and get semething
like 2-, lper cent commission on them.
Heu Mr. DANDURAND: There is a cemmissien un excise stamps, altheugli I cannet

Elon. W. B. ROSS: I do not kison about
that paragraph (a) of subsection 19. That is a
pretty serious clause.
Is it entirely new?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: "This section,"
says the .explanatory note, which my honourable friend h'as, "ýthis section is in practically
the saine language as paragraphs (c) and (d)
of subsection 3 of section 12. Its object is
to make taxable adv-ances, of the sort described, by any person."
Hon. W. B. ROSS: It is to get at trust
companies, I suppose.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Just that-my
honourable friend has it.-and similar institutions.
Hon. Mr. TODD: I would like to ask the
honourable leader of the Government a
question with regard to that.
I understand
there is no stamp tax on a note unless it
goes through a bank. That is correct, is it
not?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It is.
Hon. Mr. TODD: If a note is secured hy
collateral and does not go through a bank,
why should it be taxable?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Wbat is the
question, again?
Hon. Mr. TODD:
According to, this
section, if the samne note is secured by collateral it requires stamps. I do not see the
logic of that.
Hr1on. Mr. DANDURAND:
It is simply
applying to that note the saine treatment as
if it went to the bank.
Hon. Mr. TODD: But, as I understand, if
the note .does flot go to a bank it requires
no0 stamps.
Hon. Mr. MeLEAN: Does it not require
stamps before you can collect it-if you -have
to sue on it, for instance?
Hon. Mr. TODD; Yes, if you have to
sue.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This applies to
trust companies doing a banking business.
Hon. Mr. TODD: I have taken the case
of an individual. I do not see why a note,
if not discounted at the bank, requiros no
stampýs, whereas the same note, if there is a
collateral given, does require stamps.
Hon. Mr'. DANDURAND: I arn inforrned
that large companies, such as insurance coin-

kind of bu-miess. and the intention is that

very propecly cegarded as a nuisance, this tax
on rceipfs is outrageous. Foc one reason, I
do n'~ believe 50 par cent of the people who
should pay it actually do so. Is the Depactmnn in possession of any infocmation as to
t he numbar of people who ought to pay this
fax and the compacative number who are
payîng it? In my personal observation I see,

Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP: Do I understand my honourable friend to say if a man
pays an account with a cheque that is stamped
according to law, he should also pay for the
stamps on the receipt?
on. Mr. DANDURAND:
No. It is the
creditor receiving payment of an amount
above $10 who must put a stamp on the receipt. But, as he endorses the cheque. which
ecs back to the sender, ha informs the sender
tit i is not necessary to give a receipt.
Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP: That is right
and proper. It is not an evasion of the law.
lion. Mr. DANDURAND: The intention
of the law was that a receipt for a payment
of $10 or upwards, in order to be valid, should
have a stamp affixed to it.
Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP: Not if it is
paid by cheque, surely.
My honourable
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
friend says the Department is going to put
the screws on the people who are evading
the law. How is it going to do it? T understand that by this amendment the screws
are being loosened, and that the Department,
instead of enforcing the law, is going to say
to a man who neglects it, "We are going to
let you off."

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
offence.

For the

first

Hon. Mr. TANNER: I know, for the first
offence. The reason is that it is costing a
good deal of money to enforce the law. That
is the excuse. The business of the Government is to enforce the law whether it costs
a lot or not; but the Department is taking
the line of least resistance. I know perfectly
well, as my honourable friend has stated, that
large business concerns evade this law. But
why are they evading it? Because the Department is not enforcing the law. Cases have
personal observation,
comne under my oni
riaht here in the city of Ottawa, of large
business houses handling out what I wouid
call receipt, and what I am sure my honourable friend would call a receipt, without
affixing a stamp to it. For instance, I go
into one of the large stores and buy $30 or
$40 worth of goods-as happened in the case
T have under my hand-and I go to the
cashier and pay him, and he hands out a
statement with a rubber stamp on the bottom
of it, "With thanks." That is a receipt; yet
these stores say it is not a receipt, that it is
only a statement, and therefore they do not
have to affix a stamp to it. May I ask my
honourable friend what does the Department
Hon. Ir. DANDURAND.

They say, "Oh, there is doubt about
say?
that; we are not sure but the firm is right."
That is a most extraordinary stand for the
Departmnent to take. No ordinary man has
ever put such a construction on a document
of that kind. There is the statement of the
goods, and there is the statement "with
thanks." With thanks for what? With thanks
for the money, of course; yet the Department says to that man, "Perhaps you are
right that it is not a receipt." Is the De irtment going to accept the construction of this
That is the sort of thing that is
dealer?
going on right under the nose of the Department in this city in more than one of these
business houses. What is the view of the
Department?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I ar informed
that from the description the honourable
gentleman gives of the transaction a stamp
would be called for, and that the Department is preparing its organization to cover
this new ground.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: What about the Department's attitude?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
its organization to reach out-

It is preparing

Hon. Mr. TANNER: What is the Department doing down in the Maritime Provinces?
It is prosecuting people down there. while
here in Ottawa and the surrounding countrv
it is letting them off. It says, " Oh, we will
not fine you: we will let you off with $10."
What is $10 to one of those big departmnental
stores?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This amendment
deals with a first offence, and, as my bonourable friend knows, you minst temper justice
with mercy to those who are offending, and
who may claini innocence or ignorance. In
the case of a first offence, the Minister is
given some discretion: instead of having to
impose a fine of $50, he m'ay reduce it to S10;
but that is the end of his power.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I was going to read
what the Department says, because I have
the correspondence with the Department in
one of the cases I have referred to.
There are two points as I sec the matter.
In the first place, the law is the law. This
proposed amendment will not come into
the
operation until the 2nd of July. In
meantime, some two or three months ago,
the Department took it on itself to issue
instructions: "Do net prosecute any more
people: let therm off with $10." Where does
How
the Department get that authority?
can the public be expected to take any notice

MAY 28, 1925
of a law when the Department takes it upon
itself to override that law?
The other point is in reference to the
question of what is a receipt-I do flot propose
to give the names of the persons-and this is
what the Department stated in answer to a
gentleman who was interested in the matter:
There ia also, another feature which I wish to bring
to your attention as far as this case ls concerned.
The rubber stamp which was printed on the receipt
given to you bore the word,: "February, 1925--with
thanks." The firm was under the impression -that, a
there was nothing in those words clearly acknowledging the payment of a sum of money, this did not
constitute, a receipt. 1 admit thet there was a certain
doubt about the inatter, but when the manager initervie'ved the Departîment we pointed out to him, thât
the words "with t.hanks" signified that the firm
acknowledged to have received eomething, and, as
this stamp, is only used ini the case of cash payments, the acknowledgment can only refer ta a sum
of money. The Department does not think that, ia
view of the circuinstances, this was a straight violtio
of the law as would be the case where a party
issues a clearly worded receipt without affixing any
stamp thereto.

What are you going to say about a Department that quibbles in that way-first telling
this flrmn that it should affix a stamp, and
then stating on paper that it was flot a
straight violation of the law? What doesii
consider to be a straight violation of the law?
I do not know the difference between a
straight violation and a crooked, violation. It
is a violation just the same. Either this firm
had to put on a stamp, or it had flot. When
you find a spineless Departinent saying, "We
do not know whether it should be stamped or
not, 'bu' we do flot think it is a straight
violation," I am not at ail surprised at the
peopie treating the law with dierepect. If
the law is to be treated with respect, let the
Department treat it wit.h respect, and give
fair play to everyone; if it is going to let
department stores right here in this city do
as they please-and more than one of thein are
doing so-how does it expect people in the
backwood,- to go out and buy stamps for
receipte?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:- 0f course, the
matter is not sucli an easy one as that. We
aIl know that we can go into a store and buy
an article for $10 or more and pay our money
for it and receive the article over the coumter.
We do rnot ask for a receipt. It is a cash
payment. If, in order to keep tab on their
emiyioyees, a firm passes through the machine
the amount which has been paid, and we are
given a copy of the statement-which 1 wouid
say I do flot need-the partyr who, hande me
the statement can clearly claim that he did
not neci to give the receipt and should not
be penalized for having thanked- me for
coming into the store.
S-22

337

Hon. Mr'. TANNER: I arn not biaming
my honourable friend. If he was at the head
of the Department, I know he would flot
write sucli a letter as this. But I know
personaliy of severai other cases just like the
one I have referred to. It appears to me that
there are certain classes of people in this city
who have ýbeen disregarding the law right
along. They went to the Customs Office, and
someone hustled down to the firm, very conveniently, and got them to put the stamp on,
and they did not even pay the $10. Then
later one officiai wrote to the Department
and the reply came back from the next to the
head of the Department. I feel it my duty
to cail my honourable friend's attention to
this, because I know that ha would enforce
the law in an equitable way.
Hon. Mr. DANLURAND: I will see that
the matter is drawn to the attention of the
Departrnent.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: This is a revelation. ta
me, and I think if this interpretation of the
Act has been accepted and acted upon in the
city of Ottawa, it is practieally the only city
in Canada where it has been done. 1 know
that, as far as the Province of New Brunswick
is conceprned, the interpretation placed upon
the 'law by bte business men-the boards of
trade and business associations-ils that whenever a trensaction for $10 or over takes place
in any store, for which cash is paid, a twocent stamp *muet be attached.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: If no receipt is
.given?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: If no receipt is given;
if they made out a slip or counter slip. I do
not beiong to- the Retail Merchants Association, but I read last year an extract frorn
the proceedings at their meeting in which this
matter was stressed and the attention of some
of the mEmbers of the Association was called
to the fact that they apparently did not
cleariy urderstand that. I think that any
one of us who are not lawyers, but who think
for ourseives, wiil be dlear if we read the Act,
that when a transaction covers 310 or more,
and an acknowledgment, is given, even just
a statement, a two-cent stamp must be afflxed
to it. Certainly that has been the interpretation accepted, practically ai over Canada. It
would look to me almost as though there
was connivance on the part of the Department to allow this ta go on in the city of
Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I amn informed
that the interpretation put on this Act by the
Department of Finance is that if there is no

=EVisuD EITION

SENATE

338

receipt given the law does not cail for the
stamp. Clause 14 of the Special War Revenue
Act of 1915, which governs this point, defines
what is a receipt. It says:
For the purposes of this section the expression
"receipt" includes any note, memorandum or writing
whereby any money amounting to $10 or upwards, or
any bill of exchange or promoissory note for money
amounting to $10 or upwards is acknowledged or
expressed to have been received, deposited or repaid,
or whereby any debt or demand or any part of a
debt or demand of the amount of $10 or upwards is
acknowledged to have been settled, satisfied or discharged, or which signifies or importa any such
acknowledgment, and whether the saine is or is not
signed with the name of any person.

The view of the Department is that if a
cash sale is made and no receipt is demanded
or given, the transaction is valid.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I do not think that is
quite correct.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And yet there
is the cheque for $15, say, which goes to the
creditor for the payment of a debt. That
cheque is endorsed, collected, and the money
passed. In order to get the money the creditor
to whose order the cheque is made out endorses the cheque and that endorsation holds
as good as a separate receipt; but there is
no stamp cal.led for upon that form of receipt
which is on the document itself.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Would you just read
the last clause again, please?
For the purposes of this section the expression
"receipt" includes any note, memorandum or writing
whereby any money amounting to $10 or upwards, or
any bill of exchange or promaissory note for money
amounting to $10 or upwards is acknowledged or
expressed to have been received, deposited or repaid,
or whereby any debt or demand or any part of a
debt or demand of the amount of $10 or upwards is
acknowledged to have been settled, satisfied or discharged, or which signifies or imports any such
acknowledgement-

Hon. Mr. BLACK: There is exactly what I
had reference to: "which signifies or imports."
The receipt is very clearly an acknowledgment which signifies that the bill was paid.
If a counter check is given in which there is
an acknowledgment it should have a stamp
on it, and the interpretation of the Department to that effect is on record in the city
of St. John., and I can produce it here.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And I have not
yet read the last phrase, which will perhaps
support to a greater extent the argument of
my honourable friend:
-and whether the saine is or is not signed with the
name of any person.

Hon. Mr. BLACK: Anything which indicates that a transaction has been consummated
for $10 or more.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. M'r. MeLEAN: I would like to have
that made plain by the leader of the Government. If a man goes into a store and buys
$15 worth of goods, the party selling makes
out a slip and takes it to the cash box and it
is marked paid. Is that liable to the tax?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The information
that I have is that it is a receipt.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: What I cannot understand is why the Department is so doubtful
in the case in Ottawa?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know
from what Department the honourable gentleman from Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner) has
his information.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: The Department of
Customs and Excise. The letter is written by
the Deputy Minister.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Well, this matter will have to be investigated by the Customs Department.
Section 6 was agreed to.
On section 7-excepted articles not liable
to tax:
Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP: This is a new
section, is it not?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: They are exemptions.
Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP: Why do you
exempt certain people and not others from
this sales tax?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
gentleman will see for himself:
Vegetable plants; lasts for boots and shoes including
rubber footwear and patterns and dies for boots and
shoes including rubber footwear; goods enumerated in
customs tariff items 453e, 469a-

That is, gasoline engines and well-drilling
machinery. They are implements of production.
Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP: They are not
all the implements of production. Why exempt some and not others? What is the underlying principle of the exemption?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: These are not
the only ones; they are additions to the list.
Articles and materials to be used exclusively in the
manufacture of goods enumerated in customa tariff
items 453e, 469a.

Those are engines for boats, and welldrilling machinery.
Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP: Why does
not that machinery pay the same as other
kinds?

MAY 28, 1925
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Because these
are irnplements of production; it is in order
to try to develop our natural resources.
Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP: But there
are hundreds of machines that are implements
of production, and they pay a 5 per cent fax.
Hlon. Mr. DANDURÀND: If xny honourable friend would look at the other exemptions, he would find quite a list.
Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP: Where do you
draw the Uine?
Hon. Mr. DANDITRAND: These matters,
of course, are very carefully considered by
the Finance Department, and where it seems
to be in the interest of larger production the
customs tariff is amended.
Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP: The situation
as I see it is this. Ever since this iniquitous
sales tax was established by this Government,
the men that made the loudest noise and had
the most influence with the GovernmentHon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know
ifmy honourable friend was a Minister of
the Government -in 1921, but, if so, lie must
be somewhat more tender to his child. This
was a sales tax extablished in 1921.
Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP: Yes, 1 per
cent.
Hon. Mr. DANDtJRANIY: It was 4 per
cent at the time.
Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP: Oh, ne, it
was 1 per cent.
Hon. Mr. DKNDURAND: I arn informed
it was 4 per cent.
Hon Sir EDWARD KEMP: I say it was
not.
Hon. Mr. BELCOIJRT: What difference
does that make in principle?
Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP: There was a
1 per cent sales tax, or iý, and on certain
articles if was somewhat different. The tax
applied in theory to everyone in this country.
There are small industries and large industries
in Canada, and small merchants and large
mercliants, and it applied to everybody. There
was a certain class of men who, came te
Ottawa and said: "This bears s0 heavily on
us that we cannot pay it and do busine."
The resuit was that it was gradually whittled
down until if affected just a few industriai
enterprises and' great mercantile industries,
because the industries my honouraýble friend
referred to this afternoon were entirely
exempt from any fax of this kind.
8-22J

These mercantile concerns are the ones that
to-day are prosperous, and they are so because of the fact that fimes are duil in Canada, and there are slaughter markets ail over
the world which seek te bring goods ini here
on which there is very little customs tariff
collected. This country is not protected as
the United States is, and these mercantile
concerns buy from persons wlio are forced
te qsell, and thus they are making large
profits. Their own published statements show
that in some cases they are making profits
of a million dollars a year, and those people
are absolutely exempyt from fax.
On thle other hand, there are lit fIe factories
aIl over Canada which are in a bankrupt condition, and are paying 5 per cent on their
turnover. It can easily bie seen what effeot
this tax is liaving in this country to-day. It
is fthe most outrageous tax that was ever put
on any country and there is no precedent
for it. Neither in the United States nor in
Great Britain is anything idike fliat attempted.
How can you collect such a fax from people
wlio are bankrupt-from the man who has ne
balance on the right aide of lis balance-sheet
at the end of tlie year? What is the result in
the Department of Finance to-day? I believé
the Department would be asliamed te reveal
the situation whicli exists. There are people
in every part of this country who owe the
Department fliousands of dollars that cannot
be collected because fthc people have net the
money. Tliey are net making any money,
and conditions are such that they cannot
make a profit. How can they pay 5 per cent
on their gross turnover under these conditions?
It is impossible. This tax lias creafed a Iack
of confidence in this country: if bas been
'more detrimental flan any oflier kind of fax,
The situation ia this, that there are mert
coming te the Government every year saying
fIat fhey cannot stand this tax; and tleycannot. Look over your legislation, and your
will find that exemptions are getting down te.
narrower points. If you must have a turnover tax, put if on everyone alike-on those
wlio are successful as welI as those who ard
net se fortunafe. I say thaf if is the people
wlio make tlie loudeat cry in Ottawa Whio gef
fthe most exemptions. The exemptions are
net 50 great this year as fhey have been in
cf ler years, but liere is a ssmple.
I confend that fhis legislatien would bank-ý
rupt many of our amaller but very valuable
industrial concerna. I have observed, in the
press, from circulars that come te me, and by
experience in sitting upon oe or two boards,
fIat indusfrial organizations in thîs country
are iasuing bonds for amounts varying from

SENATE

340

$50,000 to $500,000. What are *these bonds
for? To pqv off bank overdrafts; in a great
many cases, to pay this tax. The other day
I inquired of a reputable banker: "What does
this mean, ail this issuing of bonds ail over
Canada by those small industrial concerfis?"
The answer was: "You cannot mortgage a
piece of real estate direct to a bank; a bank
cannot take such a mortgage as security; but
the bank cao say to the customer, 'Issue
bonds, under the Act, for $50.000 or 3100,000,
and pay off your overdraf t with part of it'."
As I have said, this is good for the banks,
but it is mighty poor for the industrial conceros of the country. If you; must raise the
money, put this tax upon wholesale and retail
merchants, and a amaller tax on manufacturing
econcerns3; but do flot keep wbittling this thing
down matil you get it where its effeet is ta
bankrupt people wbo have ta stand it. It
is a mighty big thing for a man ta have ta
pay $50,000 or 3100,000 ta the Government5 per cent on his turnover. There are xnany
concernis in this country whose grass 'turnover
is a million dollars, and it is upon that grass
turnover that the heavy tax of $50,000 must
*be paid. It cannot be done, and if it gaes
on you wili bankrupt une concern after
another.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Lost.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, 1 think we
are inox wg ini the right direction-in the
direction which pleases my honourable friend:
it i6 the exemption of the sales tax; and I
think if ho, looks into this very small Eist of
exemptions, he wil'l find that tbey are in the
right direction.
There is quit e a large industry known as
the boot and sboe industry which bas been
,complaining of bard times, for variaus reasans
which I will nat enumerate. They are given
au little advantage in certain matters wbicb
go inta the making of boots and sboes:
Lasts for boots and shos, including rubber footwear, arnd patterns and dies for boots and shoes. including rubber footwear.

This bas been welcome news ta those manufacturers, and I amn quite sure that it meets
with the commendation of my bonourable
friend.

There are a fe'w other items which are
practically the same ais last year. Sa there
is no abuse under this clause; and as ta, the
process wbicha my honaurable friend seems ta
fear, of un due influence being exercised at
headquarters, there is notbing that appeare in
these amendments that would suppart such an
assumaptian.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Why
should, gasoline engines be exempt?
Hon.

Sir EDWARD KEMP.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Gasoline engines
were exempt before, and the word "gacoline"
is taken out, and the word "engines" left.
This wiII make a littie profit in the purchase
of engines for boats to, be used bona fide by
fishermen for their personal use in fisheries.
I think these exemptions are 6urrounded with
sufficient safeguards, Sa that the industry that
is intended to be protected, to be heilped,
will be effectively assisted by these amendments.
Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP: I ar n ot
objecting to the boot and shoe people being
con6idered in regard to this taxation matter,
but I think there are many people in this
country wbo are in just as difficuit a position
as the boot and shoe industry. Why should
you pick out that industry, wben there are
hundreds. and thousands of others that are
in a similar position?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As a matter of
fact, the boot and shoe industry is flot
exeînpted; the exemption applies simply ta
patterns.
Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP: The taxation
was reduced by haif on the boot and shoe
inUustry.

Section 7 wvas agreed to.
Section 8 was agreed to.
Un section 9-priority of excise taxes repealed:
Hon. W. B. ROSS: This is the most important section w-e have had to deal with today. What I would like ta consider is whether
it would flot bc wise to add some words there
such as "and shall be deeîned neyer ta have
been enacted."
I suppose the repeal of this section wil
just leave the Act as it stands to-day, and
for the future there shall be no charge or lien
on a manýs assets. But what about the past?
Section 17, which We are repealing, says that
the taxes specified under this Act shall constitute a first charge on the assets of such
persan. Well, up to date fia one knows just
what that amnounts to. There is no provision
for following it up and making the charge
effective, nor for protecting the Department
or the Goveroment against a man se]ling his
property.

I suppose it is doubtful wbether a first
charge would amount to anything in default
of the Government entering an action to
declare that they had a charge, and getting
an injunction against a man who was making
away with his property, and appointing a
receiver to collect the earnings of the property

MAY 28, 1925
so as ta make the lien good. There is nothing,
when a first charge is given, that enables you
to make an execution, or any'thing like that.
It seems ta me more provocative than anything else. Would it net be betier to clear
the decks absolutely of that, and say that
this section is repealed, and shahl be deemed
never ta have been in force?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
1 arn afraid
that my honourable friend would create chaos
in very many instances by adding those words.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Not only that, but
it would open up a volume of litigatian.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: It would simply abolish
litigation.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No; if you providp
that the Act shail be deemed neyer ta have
been enacted, you stamp immediately with
nullity every step that bas been taken since its
enactment, by virtue of that provision. For
instance, priority bas been exercised in perhaps a hundred cases. You would upset al
that bas been dace in that way, and the whole
of that liquidation would have ta be begun
over again. A praprietar could bring an action,
saying: "This section is naw declared neyer ta
have been enacted; what wouldi have been
done in exercisîng any priority would be
absolutely voidi; the distribution that lias been
mnade~ of the propterty is invalid, and consequently I now have a right ta recover the
arnount that was apportioned in the way At
wa.s done." You wauld open up the whole of
tbose cases in which priarity had been exercised.
My honourable friend talks about
avoiding litigation.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED. Have there
been any cases of that nature?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not know:
there must have been.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, there have
been.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
be inclined to doubt it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: You would be
cr.eatin.glitigataioain a eertsain anab"ihdut;eway.
You are bound to have litigatian ini thet case.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Something ought ta
be dace with this: it is certainly net satisfactorT the way it is. Take the case of the
tax imposed last year. Suppose that it becorne a lien three rnonths ago; and thenl two
or three weeks frorn now, thîs Bill becornes
Iaw; will the lien or the charge, that becarne
effective three rnenths age, stiil rernaîn?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Net if it bas not
been acted upon.

Hon. W. B. ROSS: That is what I want, il
you make it this way, that wherever a lien
bas been collected it mnust rest; but ini ail
cases prier ta this Act, where this so-called
first charge was aeserted and bas flot been
actually collected, it will go.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I should say 80.
The last section provides that the Act shail
corne into force on the lst dýay of July. On
that day ev ery priority of that kind is gone
if it bas flot been exercised.
lon. W. B. ROSS: Why is it gone?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Becauee it is
abolished; it is repealed.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: This section is abolished.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But it abolishes
what? It abolishes priority. On the lst of
July ail those priorities will be gone,
absolutely.
Hon. «W B. ROSS: Ail priorities that would
have arisen if the Act were not repealed-they
are gone; but what about the past?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The past ones have
either becu consurnmated, that is, ýcompleteIy
acted upon and reýalized, and that is the end
of them; or they have not been consummated.
Sorne are stili open, but we corne along and
say that these are no longer valid.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: No, you do flot: you
say the Act is repealed.
Hon. Mr. BEWjOURT: But if the section
which gave a priority is declared neyer ta
have been enacted, then you destroy ah initie
the priority whieh has been decreed and
acted upon until this Bill becomes law; you
declýare illegal ail that has been done under
this section.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I deny that absolutely.
If you constituted a charge last year, and the
charge was effective, then tihe repeal of the
Act for the future is not going to affect the
charge of last year.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I have flot the
slightest doubt that it is. The thing is gene
absolutely. The authority under which you
justified the asserting is gene. You have no
more auttiority or basis to assert it.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: You have no more
authority ta impose a charge; but a charge
that has been imposed-whai are you geing
ta do about it? Some of them have been
collectea. and some have net.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: There was no
special procedure, or sacramental worde necescary ta exercise the priority since it was

SENATE
granted by an Act: it was the law itself. INow
the law is gone; you can no more assert it
or dlaimn it; it is gone.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I do not agree with the
honourable gentleman at ail. You repeal the
Act. That affects the future, but it leaves
the pas,. untouched. 'That is in the interpretatio-L clause of our statute: it is expressly
provided.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We will flot take
the thirdý reading to-day, and I will ask the
Department of Justice to ýpass on the contention of my honourable friend. I do flot
believe we can corne back on the past when
no action has been taken. If no action is
taken by the lst of July next, I contend that
ail the priorities that had heen registered or
that existed under this Act will be absolutely
removed.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Action has been taken
but flot completed. An actual case is now
pending, that of the winding-up of a bankrupt
estat e. Suippose a settiement bas been commenced and you are asserting your lien, but
the settlement is flot concluded. What about
that, if you repeal section 17?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would say that
if action bas been taken, then it stands.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: I will admit that where
the action is taken and completed, that ends
it; but you rnay have cases, and there are
cases-thcre is one to my knowledge-in
which neglotiations are proceeding and an
attempt is being made to arrive at a settiement. the Crown claiming priority and the
other side denying it. When that section is
repcaled, there is a lien that you cannot say
is asserted. It is in course of assertion. What
will become of that? Will the negotiations
be stopped and the Crown withdraw from that
bankrupt estate, saying, "We no longer dlaim
oîîr lien ?"
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think it
falis to the ground.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: Why not say so?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:. There is
no law by which. you can enforce it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: May I put the
matter this way to my honourable friend? Let
us take an imaginary case in point. The
liquidator has provided for this priority and
has given it rank accordingly, but it is flot
completed. He bas flot exercised that by say,
the lst of July, when the right to do so will
expire. Will he not be met by the other
creditors with this objection: "That priority
11-n. Mr. BELCOURT.

has gone. If you had put it into effect before
the lst of July, weIl and good, but you did
r.ot." An injunction surely could be taken
against a distribution which. would recognize
that priority on the 2nd of July. My honourable friend will see at once that there can
be no longer any authority to enforce it.
Section 9 was agreed to.
Sections 10 and il were agreed to.

OHICKEN HADDIE TRADE MARK
INQUIRY

Hon. JOHN MrLEAN inquired of the Government:
1. If there is anyone au.thorized tu give a trade mnark
to parties putting op Chicken Haddie.
2. xvhether this app4ies tu themn solely, as Chieken
Haddie is known as an ordinary fish, and has been pust
up for the last thirty years.

JUTNE 2, 1925
3. The information that I wish ta get is, as to
whether sucb a trade mark is registered, ani by whom,
and whether this trade mark excludes others from
putting up the same kind of fi8h under the same name,
or offering it for sale under the samne name.

Hon. Mr. DANIYURAND:
On the 5th
April, 1911, the words "'Chieken Haddies"
were registered as a specifie trade mark in
connection with the sale of fish on the application of Maritime Fish Corporation, Limited,
of Montreal, in which they declared that they
were the first to make use of said trade mark
and that it was flot in use by any other
person at the time of their adoption therecf.
If the declaration ýof said 'Corporation were
unfounded in fact, the registration ohtained
thereon would flot give them the exclusive
right to use said trade mark.
Hon. Mr. McLEAN: I have a letter from
one of the largest fish dealers in the Maritime
Provinces as f ollows:
We sincerely hope that this matter will be justWy
settled as regards Chicken Haddie.
Our principal
reason is ths.t there are several very well-deserving men
who wish to do somne canning in this line, and it
would help themn very much. To show you what an
injustice there is at present, would say that a prominent fish house here who sells fresh fish only, offered
saine Ohicken Haddie for sale, and they were pronsptly
advjsed by the Maritime Fish Corporation that they
must flot oSfer anything under Ohioken Haddie, because the Governinent had given them contrai. What
a ridiculous proposition. The Goverament maight just
s well give cantrol of codfish, saflmon or chieken halihut
ta ane concero, and dien nobody else wotid be able le
mention the naine of disse fish, or offer the goods under
such a name. 0f course the Governonent ad.mitted that
the thing had been misrepresented 'to thern 10 or 12
years ago, when the Maritime Fish Corporation got
the use of this terin, but they have the Lily brand,
and that is their hrand, and of course they are welcamne ta that brand, and it is registered, and we have
no abjection ýta thema having dhs Lily brand. You can
easiiy understand, however, that we and ail these ather
people do abject ta thein using a general trade terra,
and I arn sure diat if Chicken Haddie was ini your
section, that yau would also abject very strenuously.
and I also feel that you can ses ths injustice of the
matter.

1 would like to know if the Maritime Fish
Corporation controls 'the whole body of fish,
so that no man cala offer that, whether the
fish be fresh or salted or frozen, by putting
the product under a different name from that
registered by the corporation
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I arn somewbat
diffident in expressing my opinion on a
matter on which I know nothing. I have
simply read the answer, which states that if
the representation that was made in obtaining
that trade mark in 1911 was unfounded in
fact. then it can easily be removed or cancelled by the proper process of law; but of
course I do not know the facts as to this
ma tter.

343

Hon. Mr. McLEAN: The party who writes
tbis letter belongs to one of the ¶argest concerns handling canned fish, and they have
started an action in the court to do away with
this monopoly, as they eall it, or this exclusive ri.ght to put up Chieken Haddie, or sel
it, either fresb, frozen, salted, or in any other
way. Instead of their going to the court I
said that the Goverament would give me the
information if I made the inquiry.
Was Chieken
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Haddie koown to and soid in the Maritime
Provinces by the trade before 1911?
Certainly.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It occurs to me
that my hionourable friend bas given us the
answer to bis question, by stating that proceedings had been begun in th-- court, wbich
I suppose would be the Exebequer Court. It
is a question of law what rights are conferred
by that trade mark, and whether there is an
infringement if any other conoern puts up
Chicken Haddie under another name. It is
not a question for Parliament: it seems to
me to 'be entirely a question for the courts
to decide.
Hon. Mr. MeLEAN: I would not take
it in tbat way, becau.se ail the parties putting
up canned fisb are under the impression that
the Governmnnt would bave no right to give
an exclusive trade mark to one party to put
up one kind of fish; yet tbey bave given
this company the right to the hrand, or to the
trade mark, practicaliy giving full control of
this kind of fish.
Hon. Mr. BELCýOURT: But I amn suggestmng to my honourable friend that only the
courts may decide that question. Parliament
cannot give a decision.
Hon. Mr. MeLE AN: I imagine that tbe
Government could withdraw the decisionl wbich
gives control over the whole brand.
Hon. Mr. BELGOURT: If tbey dlaim that
the holding of this trade mark gives them the
control, only a court of justice can decide
wbether it does or does not.
Hon. Mr. MêLEAN:

Hon. Mr, BRADBURY- The other packers
would bave to take action.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Do I understand that
if the Government gives a tirade mark for a
general commodity, it cannot be cancelled?
This Chicken Haddie is flot a brand: it is a
kind of fisb. The Government migbt just
as well say that they could give a trade
mark for canned icibsters, and ihat nobody
else in the Dominion of Canada could put
tbem up. It is ridiciulous on its9 face.

344

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURA-ND:
But I ask the
attention of my honourable friend to this
situation. Under the law, and the regulations
flowing fromn that law, something has taken
place. An action bas been taken; a dernand
has been made. Now, I believe that in the
Act ilseif there is provision for an appeal to
the Commissioner or to the Minister.
We
revised the whole Act a Session or two ago,
spending a number of hours on it, but I
do not now remember the text. It may be
that by the efluxion of time an action in the
Exeblequer Court migbt not be taken;- but,
as my bonourable friend fromn Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Belcourt) says, it is a question whicb
must be taken up by an attorney.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: It
would seem to me that there is a recourse which
is sens~ible2 anid reasunable. When a department
attachez, a namne to a certain preparation of
eorie substance-in this case chieken haddie
-they give the right of a trade mark to eall
the produce the Lady brand, or whatever
the v desire 10, eal it; but it does seem
10 me absurd if that trade make covers flot
only that particular brand of chieken haddie,
but ail ehieken haddje. The trade mark
is niot given by Act of Parliament, but is
issued under authority of an Act, by the
Commissioner or the Minister, under some
sort of regulation. Il seems to me that the
flrst recourse would be to prescrnt the case ta
thie Minister and to ask that it be reviewed;
and the opinion of the Department of Justice
would be asked as to whether tbat trade mark
covered the wbole species of flsh which is
included in this namne.
That seems to me
to be a very simple and easy method. Why
should we send men to the courts and away
up 10 the Privy Council in Great Britain to
decide a simple malter of that kind, if they
can have recourse 10 the Minister himself?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But a trade mark
is like every other Crown grant, sucli as a
grant of land: when once il is issued the
Crown ilself cannot review it or change il or
interpret il.
It becomes then a malter for
the courts to inquire into. If the parties who
own Ibis trade mark are asserting rigbts ta
a monopoly or an exclusive control, anybody
can exercise wbat bie considers bis own right
as against that right, and if there is an infringement il is a malter purely for the courts.
They could flot ask the Crown to interpret
ils own grant; the grant speaks for itself. It
can be interpreted only by a court of justice.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: I would like to
ask my honourable friend, wbo is a good
lawyer, wbether the simple way 10 test this
case would not be for one fish company ta
Hon. 'Mr. BLACK.

make application to the Deparîment?
It
seems to me Ihat if the Department bas a
right la give a monopoly, il cannot refuse anotber party the right ta fish.
Hon. Mr. BiEJjCOURT:
I arn of the
opinion that the only way for these people
wbo are putling up chicken haddie is to go
on and do so, and allow the other people,
who dlaima control. 10 take an injuniction or
other proceeding in court. Or, the people
who suifer may themselves bring an action
before the Excbequer Court, whicb I understand from my bonourable friend bas already
been done.
Thal is anoîber reason wby
Parliament sbould not interfere, when the
matter is before the court, bo give ils interpretation of questions in dispute. It is quite
plain ta anybody thal Parliament cannol interfere while the matter is under litigation.
Hon. Mr. MeLEAN: When Ibis malter was
put in my bands, I thougbt I could find out the
extent of the grant that was mg-de la the
Maritime Fish Corporation, and I tbougbt the
best way was 10 ask the leader of the Government 10 put us in communication at least with
the parties wvbo issued that trade mark, and
who had authority 10 issue it, and to ask that
it might be cancelled hy the official who issued
il in case ho found that the evidence was
misrepresented 10 him at the lime. If he liad
power bo grant il, hoe sbould bave powver ta
cancel il when hoe found il was granted on false
information.

APPOINTMENT 0F SENATE OFFICIALS
MOTION

Hon. J. W. DANIEL moved:
That in the opinion of the Senate the appointment
of ail officers occupying seats on the floor of the Senate,
to whoma the Civil Service Act 9,pplies, should be selected
and appomnted by the Senaîte, and that the Civil Service
Commaission should be asked to exciode those positions
f romn the aper-ation of tic Civil Service Act.

He said: Honouraible gentlemen, since I
gave my notice of motion I understand that
the Civil Service Commission bas laken some
action .iust whal il is I do not know, and it
may be that tbis resolution, before being
finally disposed of, might ho amended inslead
of being carried in the wording I bave given
it.
I may say thal the motion was suggested
by the vacancy caused by the dealh of the

indeed were the Clerk of the Senate and the
Clerk of tbe House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
And tbe Sergeant at Arms.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Wben the Civil Service Act was passed the two officiais I have
named were put in the position of deputy
beads, and thus exempted ýfrom tihe operation
of the Civil Service Act, and aippointments
to those offices still remain in the hands
of the Cro'wn. The other officers wbo have
seats on the floor were formerly appointed
by the Sonate itsehif, but passed into the bands
of the Civil Service Commission, as did tbe
position of tbe Gentleman Usher of tbe
Black Rod. However, wben the Civil Service
Act was passed tbere was a proviso 'placed
in it wbich I will read. It is section 34 of
tho Act of 1918:

In addition to that, our late Gentleman
Usher of the Black Rod performed a great
many duties for the Senate. For instance.
whe-n the last holder of the position of Sergeant-at-Arms ini this Chamber retired, the
duties of his office were passed over to the
Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: May I ask my
honourable friend by wbat autbýority was that

power of appointment in 1867 and from that
time clown ta the passage of the Civil Service Act being with the Crown, the object
of the Act was and is ta supersede the exercise af power by the Crown or hy the
Government. That is ta say, appointments
macle hy the Governor in Council were appointments of the Crown. Those appointmentes were passed over ta the Civil Service
Commission. If appointment was ta be macle
by a lesser power than the Governor in
Councîl, where the proper language iq employed, that appointment passes over ta the
Civil Service Commission. There is no question of the Crawn having been excluded in
regard ta the appointment of the Gentleman Usher af the Black Rod, for the simple
reason that the Gavernment itself recognized
the power having been transferred to the
Civil Service Commission through having requested that Commission ta exelude the appointment of the Gentleman Usher of the
Black Rod. If the Government had conciuded that the office did nqý pass ta the
Civil Service Commission, but continued
vested in the Crown, it miglit then assert the
dagim which apparently my honourable friend
thinks possible, that it hai the power of appointment. But they are prevented from
coing that, for the simple reason that they
quite concede that it was handed over ta, the
Civil Service Commission and by their request ta the Commission excluded. The exclusion takes place under section 38B of the
Civil Service Act, Chapter 22 of the Statutes
of 1921:
(1) In any case where the Commission decides that
it is flot practicable nor in the public interesft ta apply
this Act te, any position or positions, the Commission
may, with the approval of the Governor in Cnait.
exelude such position or positions in whole or in part
f rom the operation of the Act, and make snob regniations as are decmed advisable prescribing how such position or position are ta be deait with.

It remains ta be said, £rom the information
my honouraible friend bas already given us,
that the Commission has not prescribed how
the appointment shahl be macle.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Ras Idt it ta
the law officers of the Crown ta determine.
bon. Sir JAMES LOUTGREED: Then sny
contention is that the law officers of t>he
Crown have ta be guided by the statute.
Here i.s the statu-te, readîng as plainly as
language can read, providing s ta the power
of the Commission ta make the exclusion.
Then we have Chapter 12 of the Statutes
af 1918, section 34, providing how the appaintments shaîl he mnade:
So mnch of this Act as relates ta appointment, transfer and Promotion, and ta salaries, increases and classi-

fications in the Inside Service and the psrovisiofl of
section thirty-two shaJi apply to the permanent dificers, clerks and employees of both Hanses of Parliament and of the Library of Parliament, and wherever
any action is authorized or directed ta ha takesi by the
Governor in Council or by order in couneil auch
action, with respect ta the officers, clerks and employees
of the Sonate or the House of Commons, 8hall be taken
by the Senate or the House of Commons, as the case
may be, by resolution.

Therefore it seenis to me very clear how
this appointment shall be madle. It is ta
be madle by the Senate. The report of the
Speaker of this House is practi-cally the report of a Minister of the Crown, and the
'Senate acte as the Governor in Council. The
clause speaks of the eppointmnent being made
hy the Governor in Council. We have the
Governor in Couneil here, the Speaker acting
as a Minister and tihe Senate acting as the
Council. That is expressly provîded Iby the
statute. If the appointment is macle during
a recess, the Governor in Council takes action,
making. the appointment, and it is ratified
at the next Session of Farliament by the
particular bouse ta which the appointment
applies. But during the sitting of Parliament -the appointment is entirely within the
power of the bouse in which the position is.
Furthermore, I quite agree with rny honourable friend that it is only proper that, the
Senate should have a voice, and have the
only voice, in the eltetion of its officers who
sit. on the floor of the House. The Gentleman
Usher of tihe Black Rod par.ticularly cornes
into contact with the members of the Senate
probably more than any other officer of the
bouse-more tihan even the Clerk of the
bouse himself; and ýit is desirable that ho
should be persona grata with tihe House. I
see no other way of 'bringing about that condition than the niaking by the Senate itself
of the appointment.
Ras the honHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ourable gentleman satisfied himself as ta tihe
appointment being that of an officer of the
Senate, and not an officer af Parliament?
That
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
would have been arguable had the Government not asked the Civil Service Commission
ta exolude the appointment and ta vest it
in the bouse itself. If the Government had
remained sulent in the ýmatter, it could then
very logically have taken the position that
this office neyer passed ta the Civil Service
Commission-that it ws.s vested in the Crown
in 1867 and 50 continues, and -n order for it
ta pass ta the'Civil Service Commission it
must be specifically mentioned in the Act.
But the Government did not take that
attitude.

348

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DA.NDURA'ND:
But the action
of the Governmen't does not alter the status
of the position. Would the Commons have
an equai right with us in suggesting the
appointment? I arn wondering if Black Rod
is flot more than an officer of the Senate.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHE.ED: Perhaps;
but, entirely apart from the Seinate itself, the
Goveroment must necessacily be the highest
power that can spegk upon this particular
suhiect. If it does not dlaim the appointment for itself, then it must nýecessacily vest
it in the Senate. entirely icrespective of what
has taken place under the Civil Service Act,
because there is no provision whereby the
two Houses of Parliament cao make the
appointmuent, and the position h-àving attached
to the Senate, it seems to me that Iog-ically
the power of appointment should lie here. I
hope, however, that the Government will
recognize the desirability of the Senate makin', this appointment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would My honoucable friend read again the provision which
sens to invest the Civil Service Commission
with power 'to state under what conditions the
relea-se shahl take placeHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But they
did not do that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:-which would
J)erliaps justify the cefecence to the law officers
of the Crown?
Hon. Sic JAMES LOUGHEED (reading):
In any case where the Commission decides that it
iS not practicabde nec in the pubflic interest to apply
this Act to any position or positions, the Commiîssion
may, with the approval of the Governor in Council,
exclude suoh position or positions in whole or in part
f rom. the eperation of the Art, and inake such reguilations as are deezned advisable presrribing how such
position or positions are to be deait with.

Hlon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Would not that
cover the refecence to the Iaw officers of the
Crc.wn? I wonder by virtue of what power
they made that culing?
.Hon. Sic JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
contend, without having given very much
thought to it, that this would be outside the
scope of the Commission, for the simple reason that section 34 declares how an appointment shall bc made by cither House of Parliament. 0f course, if the statute has spoken
expcessly upon 'the subýject, it is manifest that
the Civil Service Commission cannot hy regulation oust the statute.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT':

Hon. Sic JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes. Consequently the language employed in section

that this question is 'heing discussed fcom al
its ang-les, more especially its legal aspect. I
myself suggested to the Minister of Juslice,
whien I 'heard the reading of this report, that

cannot have too much information with reference to it. Prima facie, I arn opposed to this
continuai asking of the Civil Service Commission to release certain positions. There is
your law. It was made Iby Parliament. If
Parliament has changed its mind-if tihe Government has a certain view with reférence to
particular offices, and Parliament agrees with
the Gcvemnment, it seems te, me that the
straightest and best way is to amiend the
Act so as to release those appointmcnts from
it.s operation, rather than to be continually
putting before the Commission reques's for exclusion and 'bringing te bear upon the Commi~ssion pressure which, to my mind, detracts
a good deal from its inciependernte and the
respect due to it. Let Parliament déclare
its view regarding certain offices and amend
the Act accordingly.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But there need
be no amending of the Act in this instance,
because the request made to the Civil Service
Commission is 'based upon a proviso in the
Act that authorizes the making of such a
request.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
And trhe Commission has agreed to that?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Honourabe gentlemen, if my honourabie friend is rht in
his contenticn, I think we are driven to, the
conclusion that at no time. since the Act of
1918 anyway, has the Civil Service Commission
had any jurisdiction or any say in the matter.
If I followed my honourable friend's arguments, that is the neeessary conclusion.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, no;
quite the oontrary.
Hion. Mr. BELCOURT: I wanted to make
sure.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The Act,
Chapter 12 of the Statutes of 1918, was .passed
in pursuance of our having abandoned the
right of .appointment, and we then vested it
in the Civil Service Commission.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Does my
honourable friend refer to me?
Hon. Mr. BEILOOURT: Yes. If that is
the case, the jurisdiction or discreétion on the
part of the ýCïvil Service Commission ws
wiped out, destroyed completely, in 1918, and
it had nothing to release, or noth-ing to do.

So much of this Act as relates to a4Ypointrnent, transfer and promotion, and to salaries, increases and classification ini the Inside Service and the provisions of
section thirty-two shail apply to the permanent officers,
elerks, and employees of both Houses of Parliament
and of the Library of Parliament.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Not at
that time-not ixntil the Act was amended in
1921.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: If I understand
aright, my honourable friend says that after
section 38 wa.s*enacted the Commission was
powerless with regard to officers of both
Houses.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUJGHEED: No; I do
flot say that.
Hon. Mr, BELCOURT: I understood my
honourable friend to argue thmt from that time
on the Civil Service Commission jg deprived
of any jurisdiction at tail ini the matter of employees of both Houses.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I understand that by
section 34 each branch of Pýarliament was
given the power to appoint its own officers.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What does section 34 mean if it does noV mean that?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: That is what section
34 says.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEEED: Until that
time the Civil Service Commision had no
authority ito appoint an officer of Parliament.
It had power to appoint departmental, officers.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That makes no
difference.
That makes no0
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:
difference.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But the
Commission wae given increased power in
1918.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: A law was passed in
1918, and we have Vo, ascertain whiat it is. It
provides:

That does not bear on the question; but
let us rend further:
And whenever any action is authorized or by Order
in Council, such action, with respect to the officers,
cierks and employees of the Sena-te or of the House of
Gommons, ehail be taken by the Senate or the House
of Gommons, as the case may ba, by resolution.

This, I understand, means that whenever an
officer or employee of the Senate is aippointed
by Order in Coundil, he shall be appointed by
resolution of the Senate, and 'likewise an officer
or employee of the Hotise of Clommons ehail
be appointed by oeSlution oi thst House-.
It seems to me that what we have to
dé'termine is whether the Black R;od. is an
offlier of Panlisment or an officer of the
Senate. On re£ferring to Bourinot, I find
that -when doel'ig with offioers of tihe
Senate he reiera to the Bl'ack Rod as an

350

SENATE

officer of this House, and, on referring to May,
I find the samne thing, that the Gentleman
Lsher of the Black Rod in England is an
officer of the House of Lords. Therefore, if
the Black Rod is an officer of the Senate, it
seems to me that the appnintment is governed
by section 34 of Chapter 12 of the Statute of
1918; and that, as the honourable member
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) has just
stated, the Civil Service Commission lias no
jurisdiction whatever. It cannot exelude the
office from the operation of the Act, because
it does not flu under the Commission.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My contention is quite the contrary.
Hon. Mr. FISHER: Honourahle gentlemen,
if it is the intention of the Senate simply to
obtain a straight expression of opinion from
its members as to whether this appointment
should be made by the Senate or flot, I think
that could be brouglit about by amending
the motion of the honourable member from
St. John. I would therefore move:
That ai] the words after "Senate" in the third Une
be struck out.

The motion would then read:
That, in the opiniîir of the Senate, ail officers
occupying scats on the floor of the Senate to whom
the Civil Service Act applies should be selected and
appointed by the Senate.

It seems to me that that would express our
views in a straightforward manmrer on this
question.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But that would be
a contradiction in terms, admitting on the one
hand that tlie Civil Service Act applies to
these offices, and then going on to say that it
should not.
Hon. Mr. FISHER: Tlien I will change
the amendment to read:
That, in the opinionl of the Senate, ail officers occuipying scats on the floor of the Senate should be selected
and appointer! by the Senate.

Before the motion is put I would like to
ask the lionourable leader if lie lias any information as to whether or not it is tlie intention of the Government to dlaimi the riglit to
make this appointment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
0f course, I
have no officiai mandate in answering, but I
am quite sure that I express tlie opinion of
the wliole Council wlien I say that, after-the
reading of tliat report fromn tlie Civil Service
Commission, suggesting that the law officers of
tlie Crown bie consulted, the matter lias been
or will be turned over to tlie law officers of
the Crown. I hesitate even to say that is has
rot been done, but it seemed evident that
the report of the Civil Service Commission
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

had to follow its course. I cannot say what
was the decision, but I can say tliat I had the

feeling that, since the report of the Civil
Service Commission was as it was, there was
nothing to do but to follow the advice and
report of the' Commission.

Hon. Mr. IFISHER: I thank tlie honourable
gentleman for tlie information, -vhiicli I am
quite sure wvill satisfy tbe House tliat it is
the intention of tlie Government to dlaimi the
appointment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But I cannot
say that, because ail tbat the Government
bas before it is tlie report of tlie Civil Service
Commission; and liow can my honourable
friend expect that tbe Government will express ýtheir opinion or take any action wlien
the legal aspect of the situation must 'be
reviewed by the officers of the ýCrown, aecording to tbe advice of the Civil Service
Commission?
I may say, however, that I am authorized
to declare tliae if by some conclusion that
would be arrived at-I do not say by wliomthe *Crown had the appointment, tlie Senate
of Canada would be consulted, because I
would not admit that a higli officer of tlie
Senaite, liaving dailv contact with tbe Chamber, would lie appointed without being
pcrsona grata witli the Senate.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Would
My honourable friend revise that mode of
consultation, so to speak, and allow the
Soate to suggest the appointment, and let
the Government ratify it; tliat is, if the Goveroment assumes to itself tlie riglit to appoint,
whicb I very mucli doulit.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Well, I would
suggest tliat tbe Senate take no action upon
flic motion of my -bonourable friend. This
is a matter of consequence-of sncb consequence that il tbe Senate, in its wisdom,
decided to dlaim the appointment of all the
officers wlio sit at the Taible, it would lie
reversing the decision of tbe Senate wliicli
initiated anotber procedure. We must not
forget that in 1867 the Senate declared tliat
certain positions were Crown appoîntments,
or appointments to me made by the Crown
-I do not remember the exact words of th~e
resolution. But the matter is of sucl i mportance ýthat the Senate should examine into
the situation somewhat closely, more especialiy,
wlien we liave the Civil Service Commission,
to whom we of the Parliament of Canada
delegated -certain powers as to appointment
and selection, releasing tbat position under
certain circumstances, the ternis of whicli we
have not before us.

JUNE 2, 1925
I have conveyed the purport of the report,
but I will lay it 'before the House at the next
Sitting.
Hon. Mr. POPE: 1 fail to sec why the
action in 1867 should be any precedent for
us at ail. In 1867 there was no organization
eit'her by the one Chamber or the other, and
there was no Civil Service Commission.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not claim
that the Senate is bound. I would say that
though the Senate passed a resolution even
as far back as 1867, it could always recali
that resolution.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I hope that, witihout
the necessity of moving a sub-amendment, my
honourable friend from Brant (Hon. Mi,.
Fisher) will agree to -have the debate adjourned until a future date so that we may
get ail fthe information that we need. There
is no especial hurry for the appointment. The
honourable leader of the Government told
us a little while ago that we are likely ta be
here for five or six weeks yet.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, but I will
make this correction. We may be here for
five or six weeks, but I believe that the Government will need some money before the end
of the Session, and the Black Rod will have
to knock at the door of the Commons shortly.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May I
ask my honourable fxiend whether this is a
new development-that we are expected ta be
here five or six weeks?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend was noît here when we had a heart-toheart talk over this matter.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Is not the Government in need of some funds very soon?
How are we going ta get them. without the
Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We will have
ta pase a Supplementary Supply Bill.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIIN: Surely the finances
of this country do flot depend on the appointment of an Usher of the Black Rod.
Suppose there was none on that particular
day; suppose he had been run over by a
Street car, would the whole machinery of
Parliament be tied up on that account? I
think the Government or this House could
appoint some one ta go ta the Commons
and tell them that the Governor was waiting
for themn in this Chamber.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I join with the honourable gentleman from Ottawa'(Hon. Mr. Belcourt) in suggesting that the débate be ad-

journed; I think it is but proper, when the
matter is under advice in another House.
Hon. Mr. FISHER: I will move the adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
suggest ta my honourable friend, that he
direct the attention of the Government ta
this motion, so that they may know what the
sentiment of this House is.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: We do not know
that.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Well, we
will take it now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, but I intended ta draw the attention of the offcers
of the Crown, if they are studying the situation, ta the debate that has taken place in
this Chamber.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Fisher, the debate
was adjourned.

FINLAND TRADE AGREEMENT BILL

THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND
moved the
second reading of Bill 128, an Act respecting
Trade between Canada and Finland.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, we gave
some attention to this Treaty or agreement
with Finland last year, and the fear was expressed by some that the passing of the
Treaty would be detrimental to some important Canadian industries. The matter
which was 'more especially stressed was the
production of Kraft paper. It was stated also
at that time that the importations from Finland were infinitesimai under aIl heads. As
a. matter of fact, the total value of goods imported into this country from Finland to
March 31. 1924, was $6,090; and the year ending March 31, 1925 showed a slight inicrease,

the importations amounting te $16,593. Our
exports te Finland in the year ending M'arch
31, 1924 were $1,754,279, which deareased last
year-though still remaining above the mi,1lion mark-to $1,038,009.
Wbhen we look at the things that Finland
can export te Canada we find nothing to lead
us te believe that Canadian intereste wilil be
induriously affeted te any degree. Our exporters are very much interested in trying te
develop that trade, and last year they were
fearful of some advantages being granted te
our particular rival in that market, our
neighbour to the south. Well may they have
been fearful, for we find that on the 2nd of
May, 1925, the United States and Finland, by
an exrchange of noites agreed te accord eaeh
other unconditional mot favoured nation
treatment. The part of the modus vivendi
relating te import and expert duties became
effective on May 17, 1925, while ail other
matters in the agreement will 'become effective
when the Finnish Government has notified
the United States that it has taken the necessary legislative action. The agreement may
be termina!ted afiter thirty days notice from
either party or by mutual agreement.
According to information obtained frein the
United States Department of Commerce, the
principal classes of commodities on which
reduced conventional rates have been established in the Finnish tariff, and which are
now extended te products of American origin
are as follows:
Raisins, fruit conserves, confectionery, canned meats,
fish, fruits and vegetables, prepared mustard, mineral
waters, tobacco products other than cigars and
cigarettes, certain textile fabries of jute, wool and silk,
lace and trimmings, knit goods of silk, rubberized silk
fabnics, clothing of silk or trimmed with silk or embroidery, silk umbrellas, artificial flowers, bags, portfolios, etc.; certain wood manufactures, blanks for
cards, labdls, etc.; walil paper; certain manufactures of
ivory, celluloid, etc.; footwear-

-in

which we are specially interested-

-leather gloves, manufactures of gold, silver and platinum, table knives and forke with handles of ivory,
gilt, silvered, etc.; gilt or sllvered scissors, etc.; fire
arma; vehicles of all kinds, and rubber tired wheels
therefor, except veh-icles for transporting timber and
motor trucks; phonographs and other musical instruments-

-of which we export a considerable quantity-phonographs and other musical instruments, except
pianos and organs; luxury articles of porcelain, perfumes and other things.

This is a warning te Canada to be on the
alert te secure the most-favoured-nation treatment in Finland. We can get it by agreeing
under a clause of a Treaty which has been
made between Great Britain and Finland,
which says:
S-23

353

The stipulations of the present Treaty shail net be
applicable to India or te any of His Britannic Majesty's
self-governing dominions, colonies, possessions, or protectorates, unless notice is given by His Britannie
Majesty's representative at Helsingfors of the desire of
His Britannic Majesty that the said stipulations shal
apply to any such territory.
Nevertheless, gouds produced or manufactured in
India or any of His Britannic Majesty'« self-governing dominions, colonies, possessions or proteotorates
shall enjoy in Finland the same treatment as would be
enjoyed by similar goods if produced or manufactured
in the United Kingdom, su long as goods produced or
manufactured in Finland are accorded in India or such
self-governing dominion, colony possession or protectorote, treatment as favourable as that accorded te goods
produced or manufactured in any other foreign country.

Under this clause te which we are adhering
in virtue of the Bill now before the Senate,
we will grant the mostfavoured-nation treatment to Finland. This means that all kinds
of paper which bear 25 per cent will be
reduced te 20.25 per cent. Wood manufactures will be reduced from 25 per cent te
20.25. Machinery, which is 27.50, will be
22.50; boots and shoes, which bear 30 per
cent, will be 27.50 per cent. As a matter of
fact, the value of the kraft paper imported
last year was only $2,777, while our production of kraft, manila, mill, straw and wood
manila and all other wrapping papers was
$7,666,174, of which we exported $3,153,515.
From this it will be seen that we are disposing of our kraft paper te the outside world
te the tune of nearly 50 per cent, and that
there is no very great danger, with a duty
of 25 per cent, that Finland will increase its
sales in the Canadian market.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable gentlemen, there is certainly no agreement se
important as an agreement between two countries; and tlhere is none se complicated and
se far reaching in its effects or se difficult te
judge as an agreement of this kind when
presented simply in a few words.
I do not contend for one moment that this
Treaty would not be favourable te Canada;
but I think we must act with a great deal
of prudence and, te the best of our ability
get all the information we can to ascertain
what will be tihe result of an agreement of
this kind on the trade of Canada. I am
rising now te suggest to my honourable friend
the advisability of submitting tlhis agreement
te a Committee of the House"referably
the Committee on Banking and Commercese that the officer of the Crown who made
the agreement an give us ail the information
required, and also se that we may bear those
whose trade may be affected and very
seriously affected by a Treaty of this kind.
For my part, I do not attach a great deal
of importance te the fact that we are allowed

to participate in this agreement by means
of a Treaty between Finland and Great
Britain. Great Britain is a free trade country;
when she says to another country: "We are
going te give you the very best conditions,"
she gives nothing at all. As far as the British
market is 'concerned, there is no protection;
it is open to all nations of the world; and
such a statement is really an invitation to
another nation to come in with the rest of
the nations of the universe. Great Britain

most-favoured-nation clause applies, which
means that the Treaty with France is applied
to every nation with which we make an
agreement of this kind. And what, forsooth,
with be the result if it is applied to every
nation? It simply means that the tariff is
reduced so much, that it is an indirect way
of giving us freer trade all the time. I do
not say that such is the purpose of this parThat will probably be

the result. It seems to me that it is our
duty to be perfectly well-informed, and the
best way to obtain information for or against
an agreement of this kind is to adopt the
procedure ordinarily followed with contracts
of much less importance than this. namely,
to refer the proposal to a Committee and
hear the evidence for and against it. Then
we shall be in a much better position te
decide.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, I quite concur in what my
honourble friend from Montarville (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien) has observed in regard to this
Treaty. At the last Session of Parliament
we rejected this proposal by, I think, an almost unanimous vote. To permit the Treaty
to pass without some intelligent consideration
would be an unfavourable commentary upon
the action taken by the Senate last year. There
is -no legislation about which we know less than
foreien treaties.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:

That is right.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We have
not the opportunity to familiarize ourselves
with the reasons which have led to their
negotiation. With the merits or demerits of
domestic legislation we are of course in a
position to become thoroughly acquainted. A
presentation of a matter of this kind on the
floor of the House is not satisfactory, although my honourable friend has submitted
this treaty in a very able way. He may be
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

familiar with it himself, yet I have no doubt
that if cross-examined upon the reasons which
have led to its negotiation, he would find
himself somewhat at sea. Sitting around a
committee table with the officers of the department who are familiar with the subject
the members of the Senate who are interested
would become acquainted with the reasons
which have led to the negotiations of this
particular Treaty. I venture to say there is
not an honourable member of this Chamber
who could to-night form an intelligent conception of what it all means. None of us
could give any information as to the origin of
the Treaty and the displacement which must
necessarily take place in our trade in Canada,
whether the Trea:ty is to our advantage or
to our disadvantage. I would therefore suggest to my honourable friend that, in view. of
the desirability of our being more intimately
acquainted with the merits of the case, this
Bill should be referred to the Committee on
Banking and Commerce, in order that we may
hear the departmental officers who are
familiar with it and thus understand what we
are doing in either passing it or rejecting it.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gentlemen, I readily admit that it is rather
difficult for a body of men, on hearing a statement which is somewhat technical and covers
a number of statistics, to grasp its purport.
My intention was to follow the ordinary practice-to ask for the second reading of this
Bill and then have it referred to Committee
of the Whole, where J would be ready ta
answer questions and give information wbich
would throw more light on the matter, and to
submit all the documents and statistics in my
possession. But I have no objection whatever
to following the method suggested to me.
It is a departure from the procedure of this
House with reference to treaties and treaty
making; but I realize that the Banking and
Commerce Committee may be in a botter
position to obtain correct information from the
officers of the various departments that have
to do with these arrangements.
I desire to add only a word as to the
merits of the Bill and the proposed arrangeOne must free himself
ment with Finland.
My honfrom prejudices born of tradition.
ourable friend from Montarville fears a reduction of duty. He champions higher tariffs
in this country, but I would point that if
there is one consoling feature in the present
economic situation in Canada it is the development of its foreign trade, which affords
greater protection and greater prosperity to
the manufacturers of this country. They have

851

JUNE 2, 1925
but a limited home market. They must look
beyond it for the sale of their goodis. When I
see Finland importing nearly all the manufactured goods it needs, and when I see that
its sales to us are insignificant and can be in
only a few lines-I have before me a list of
what Finland has been selling and I find that,
as compared with $8,000 worth which it sold
to us, we sold 'to Finland in 1924 $1,754,000
worth-I say, let not our manufacturers be

think, they have vision, they will not be afraid
of this country being invaded by imports of
Kraft paper from Finland, as they were afraid
last year. Canada is producing Kraft paper
to the value of $7,666,000 a year, and is exporting it to the outside world at the rate of
$3,153,000 worth annually. All that Finland

when I look at the list of articles that we are
selling, I say that even if such a fear remains
in the minds of the manufactures of Kraft

Treaty in order that the agricultural producers and the manufacturers in Canada may
develop the Finland market, as they have been
doing of late years.
Hon Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We may
become quite enthusiastic over the proposal
when it comes out of Committee.

ever, I will ask my honourable friends to
come to the Committee on Banking and Commerce, to which I will move that this Bill be
referred, and to come with an open mind and
a desire to do that which is in the best interests of this country.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time, and was referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
NETHERLANDS CONVENTION BILL

Hon. Mr. ROCHE: Is Borneo altogether
under the dominion of the Netherlands?
I am under
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the impression that it is not entirely, but I
have here the statement that in the Netherlands' possession of Borneo there are two
millions of people.
The customs tariff is low in all these countries. There are no treaty or convention rates
lower than the general tariff. According to
Dutch parliamentary papers, the desirability
to introduce a system whereby it will be possible to discriminate in certain cases in eustoms matters (measures of retaliation) is
being studied, and the matter will eventually
be dealt with in a new separate law. This
matter has not been provided for in the new
customs tariff law.
The principal imports from the Netherlands
into Canada are as follows: Coeoa butter,
gin, plants, shrubs and nursery stock, tobacco,
starch, pickled herrings, artificial silk, binder
twine, railway bars, electric lamps, diamonds
unset, aniline dyes, litharge, zinc white,
glycerine for explosives, toys. On most of
these items there is practically no difference
between our general tariff rates and conventional rates.
The principal exports fror Canada to the
Netherlands arp as follows: Wheat, wheat
flour, oats, rye, oil cake, condensed millk,
lard, electric vacuum cleaners, automobiles,
nickel and asbestoes.
The value of imports from the Netherlands
into Canada for the year ended 31st March,
1924, was $5,359,980; and for the year ended
31st March, 1925, $5,077,323.
Value of exports (Canadian produce) exported to the Netherlands: For the year

ended 31st March, 1924, $9,488.881; for the
year ended March, 1925, $12,644245.
There is a considerable trade between Canada and the Dutch possessions, especially
with the Dutch East Indies. The imports
into Canada from this country during the
eleven months ended February, 1925, were
valued at $2.941,187 which was practically all
sugar, coffee and tea-the treaty rates are
the same as in the general tariff.
During the same period the principal exports from Canada to the Dutch possessions
were rubber tires, canned salmon and automobiles. The total value was $1,350,067.
The United States have a favoured-nation

porters are very much concerned lest they
should lose their market, which is developing,
through some favours given by the Netherlands which they would not enjoy.
Under the present agreement Holland renounces the right-and I do not know to
what extent it ever used it-to levy a duty
on goods in transit. It had the right to tax
goods passing through the Netherlands into

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
suggest that this Bill should go to the Banking and Commerce Connittee, just the same
as the other one. We can deal fully with
those matters there.
In order that
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
my honourable friends may know the effect of
this Treaty upon our Customs levy, I may
state that during the fiscal year ending March
31st, 1925, on principal imports from the
Netherlands of $4,075,792, the reduction of
duty under the intermediate tariff rates, as
compared with the general tariff rates, was
$20,297.38; and under the treaty rates the
reduction would have been $28,094.80. Using
the same ratio, on total importations of
$5,077,323, the reduction of duty under the
intermediate tariff was $25,373.72, and under
the treaty rates $35,093.50.
As for the Dutch colonies, the only reductions in duty would be from the Duteh East
Indies. $5,848.33 on shelled peanuts, and
$791.45 on sago and tapioca. The Treaty
rates of duty on sago and tapioca are the
same as under the intermediate tariff. The
Netherlands already enjoy our intermediate
tariff.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
Ion. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
I understand this
Bill will be sent to the Committee on Banking and Commerce?
Yes; I move
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
that it be sent to that Committee.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
My honourable
friend will understand that it is absolutely
impossible to judge of the value of this
Treatv so sudd(nl.
I quite aigree that it has
some excellent points, and it is quite possible
that it should be a very desirable Treaty
for us; but my point is that it is the most
important contract that we can make. We
are binding all our producers and exporters
-aIl of them, not one-and surely we should
have every opportunity to ascertain what will
be the result. We cannot take too much
precaution to get information on the subject.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was referred to the Committee on Banking
and Commerce.

CHICKEN HADDIE TRADE MARK
FURTHER REPLY TO INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I desire to communicate to the honourable gentleman from
Prince Edward Island (Hon. Mr. McLean)
a letter I have received from the Commissioner of Patents, Mr. George F. O'Halloran:

JUNE .4, 1925
I have just read in Hansard of the 2nd instant the
report of the discussion on Senator Mctean's question
regarding the trade mark "Chieken Haddies."
After a trade mark is registered the Minister ha&
no authority to vary or expunge the registration. The,
authocity to do this is vested exelusively in the Exchequer Court by the Trade Mark and Design Act.
There has been a great deal of corresponde 1nce in
regard to this trade mark in which the above explanation bas been given.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Is it flot true that the Minister of Justice
may move in the matter if hie thinks a wrong
has been committed?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The answer
seems to be fairly ernphatic on this point,
but I will ask the Commissioner of Patents
to examine anew the Act and see if there
cannot be action taken by the Department
of Justice.
Riglit Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I think there can.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I would be
somewhat surprised if there were such a discretion vested in the Minister of Justice; but
if there is, his attention will be called to this
matter.
CANADA'S POPULATION
INQUIItY AND DISCUSSION

Hon, C. P. BEAUBIEN rose in accordance
with the following notice:
That he wiHl cenl the attention of the Goveroment to
the regrettable falling off in the growth of the population of Canada, the causes and consequences thereof,
and thie urgent necessity of remedying the same, and
inquire what action, if any, the Governanent propose to
take.

He said: Hono urable gentlemen, I arn going to
crave your indulgence for a few moments, to
treat of asubi ect whichlIconsider of pararnount
importance to Canada. I do not think the
prosperity of individuals or the future of any
people in any other country of the world
can be said to be predicated upon one factor
to, such an extent as the prosper.ity and happiness of the people of Canada and the
greatness of its future are predicated on the
growth of the Canadian population.
In order to give what I believe to be the
rîght proportions to, the f ew remarks that I
intend to make, I think perhaps it would be
wise, first of ail, to construet the frarne in
which those rernarks flnd their place. We
in Canada occupy a very peculiar situation.
We are next to the greatest people in number and wealth, perhaps, that exists in the
world, and certainly the most progressive.
We have 3,000 miles of boundary, which. is
not a dividinýg line between the two countries,
but a uniting line. Our people on the whole

357

speak the saine language and have the samne
customns as the people across the line, and
they do their business in the samne way. As
the lesser is subi ect to the attraction of the
greater, we are exposed to that tremendous
influence which cornes frorn the United States
and overspreads our border. Every day we
receive from the United States literature in
every form, newspapers and periodicals;
everywhere, ahl the time, the greatness, the
advantages, and the seduýctions of this land
Iying close to us are brought to our attention
in a very striking manner. Every day we
have before us films exposing to our people
idealistic images such as the film only can
create, and everything imaginable is being
done to paint the land of old Uncle Samn as
the land of promise.
Do I exaggerate when I say that? I do flot
think I do. WilI you allow me to read what
Lord Newton said in the Hlouse of Lords
about American films. 0f course, what is
true in London is doubly true here. This is
taken from the New York Timnes:
Lord Newton, calling attention to the preserit state
of the English film industry, asked for a departmental
inquiry.
"The proportion of foreign films shown here amounts
to 90 per cent and in the wbole Empire 99,1' he said.
"It has become praetically impossible for British producers to compete with Americans. Ainericans realized,
almost simultsneeusly with the cinema, the heaven-sent
method of advertising themselves, their country, methods, wares, ideas and even language, and they seized
on it as a method of persuading the whole world that
America was really the only country that counted.

This is testimony given before the House of
Lords in London, 3,000 miles away; we here,
the next door neighbour of the United States,
are much more expýosed to the influence of
this formidable propaganda.
Since Confederation, and prior to that time,
rcp to the war, our financial centre had always
been in ýLondon. Where is it to-day? In
1923, of the capital required to develop and
build up this country, $2,400,000 came from
Great Britain. How mucli do you think came
froun the United States?
No less than
$8-4,000,00. On that point, will you allow me
to 'give

you the testimony of a gentleman

whom nobody in this House will doubt:
In bis remarks delivered at Manchester University,
Sir Robert Falconer, president of the University of
Toronto, gave a grapbie picture of the significant
economie changes that baS come over the international
relations of Canada not only since the outbreak of the
war but even in the last four or five years. In 1920
the amnount of outside capital invested in Canada was,
$450,000,000; to-day it la more than $4,640,000,000.
Simultaneously the United States has been displacing
Great Britain as the leaSing investor in the Dominion.
By far the greater part of foreign capital invested there
i 1900 wae British; now Amnerican investment is et
least equal to if not larger than that from Great
Britain. 0f the total investments in Canada's manufacturing industries, 58 per cent are owned by Cana-

SENATE
dians, ten per cent by residents of the United Kingdom
and 31 per cent by Americans, whose holdings are
valued at $850,000,000. One fourth of all the foreign
investments of the United States are in Canada.
What is true of investment is true of trade. Forty
one per cent of the exports of Canada go to the United
States, while only 34 per cent go to Great Britain.
Two thirds of all the imports of Canada come from
the United States; we sell to the British dominion,
in fact, approximately four times as much in value
as the mother country does.
This state of affairs is always geographically inevitable. Connected by 3,000 miles of border line it is
idle to suppose that the economic relations of Canada
and the United States can be less in volume than those
between Canada and an island separated by 2,000 miles
of sea.

This enunciation of opinion by Sir Robert
Falconer brings me exactly to the point where
I want to begin my argument. It is due to
no fault of anybodv that the conditions with
which we are faced to-day exist- it is inevitable. We are the lesser country, and lie alongside a much greater one with a tremendous
line of contact. Geographically that is the
situation. May I add one word by saying
what is the political situation? I shall nut
insist on tiat score except to ask you this:
have you ever before this heard such an open
expression from certain parts of the country
in criticiei of the manner in which Confederation has been applied to certain provinces?
Another question I an going to ask you,
quite frankly, if you will allow me: in vour
conversations with those whorn you know
best, and those in a position best to judge
the situation, have vou net had a heart-toheart exchange of opinion as to Canada's
present condition and future position in relation te the United States? Those of you
who have had such conversations know what
it means: in a word-let us say it-a real
serious anxiety as to the integrity of Canada.
I have had some misgivings as to speaking
as I am going to do before this House, because it is net good advertising for Canada;
but I am impelled by this thought: if the
real conditions are not known, particularly
in my province, what is going to happen?
Last Session, I think it was, the Prime
Minister of this country, in another place,
stated that Canada was facing three alternatives-the status quo, independence, or annexation to the United States. My memory
may be short, but I think it is the first time
that ever in the Parliament of Canada annexation to the United States was openly
admitted as a possibility.
The background for my remarks having
been laid before yeu, so that I do not have
to come back to this subject, I beg to submit to you, honourable gentlemen, as a jury,
a series of facts. Allow me, then. to proceed.
Hon.

Mr. BEAUBIEN.

A great deal has been said about emigration
from Canada to the United States; but I have
observed that in another place the members
did not seem to agree as to the losses Canada
had made within recent years. Strange to
say, on a subject vital to Canada we have
absolutely no efficient control. Every time
we lose one Canadian it is a terrible loss,
because I hold that no two foreigners can
replace on our soil one Canadian who leaves
the land. We have all sorts of mechanism,
an organized army te stop every foreigner
at the frontier and look him over, take his
temperature, his place of birth, etc.; but there
is no such control whatsoever as to the flesh
and blood that leaves us. Yet is it net true
that it is twice as important for Canada to
know the hemorrhage that is bleeding us
white, than to find out on what infusion we
can count to rebuild our constant loss of
vitality.
Perhaps, honourable gentlemen, you may
think that this would be an expensive and
difficult thing. Not at all. We have officers
at the frontier, and so have the Americans.
Our officials have only to consult the American sheets on which is registered every Canadian who goes out, and we could have a
full picture, and a complete and perfect picture, every night if we so wanted, of our
emigration, and it would net cost us one cent
more in administrative expense. Why, may
I ask, has the Government neglected to contirol the loss that we are making of ouýr own
citizens?
I think the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
control was established last year, the first
time since 1867.
There exists no
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
such control that I know of, though I stand
subject to correction. In the other House
two opinions were held as to our losses last
year. How were the losses calculated? From
Nothing of the kind.
our official reports?
Why, we had te get the members of Parliament, and even the Ministers, te jOurney
to Washinzton, take off their bats, and ask
the Departments at Washington to be good
enough to open their booles and prepare
statistics for us. Nothing else was available,
and the discussion in the other House dealt
only with the interpretation and appreciation
of the American statistics.
What do those members say? One member of Parliament .contended that the loss
we suffered last year was 181,000, and on the
other hand a member of the Cabinet contended that the loss was only 165,000. In the
previous year the one gentleman contended

JIJNE 4,1925
that the lacs wae 1W3,000, while the other hcld
it was only 83,000. Sa that, after ail, putting
conditions as favourabiy as thcy can be, aur
lacs in 1923 was over 83,000, and in 1924 was
over 165,000.
Now, the question I want ta put ta the
Senate is this: is that a truc picture? There
is no hetter methaci of judging thc statistirs
given ta us from Washingtan than by confronting them with aur own statictics. That
is what I have donc. Evcrybody knows what
a cruel disappointmcnt ta us was thc recuit of
the cencus of 1921. What did aur own census
of 1921 reveal? It showcd that in 1911 aur
population was 7,206,000. In thc decade that
followed we had, by immigration-cvery anc
of the incamers hcing controllcd-rccivcd na
less than 1,975,000 people. Our natural increaee, calculated at the lowcst possible
average, 23 and a fraction pcr thousand, gave
us an additional increment of 1,880,000--all
in round figures. We ehould havc found that
in ton years Canada had incrcased. ta the tune
of about 4,000,000; but wbat was the real increace found at the expiry of this decade?
Was it 4,000,000? Was it 50 per cent of that?
No; aur increase was but 1,500,000.
Now, let us rcvcrt ta thc oniy information
open ta us--the statistics of the United States.
What do the American statisties reveal as
ta the mavement of aur population ta the
American repuhlic within those ton ycars?
The figures show that 742,000 cmigrated. We
have lost nearly 2,500,000 people, and everybadly knaws that tbcy wcnt sauth. Yct the
American statistics show thrce quartcrs of a
million. How can we explain that? Very
simply. The American statistics take in anly
the Canadian-born-that ie thc first explanatian; and besides, there is a frightful invisible
lacs from people being cmugglcd across the
frontier. Therefore we have canclusive cvidcncc that this figure of 742,000 must be
multiplied by threc; and when wc do sa
multiply it by three wc do nat in the last
cxaggerate. Sa during those ton years we have
lost about 2,500,000 of aur people, or, ta make
it absolutely exact-I have the figures here2,273,000, which means an average af 227,000
people every year.
I amn gaing ta put this question ta honourable gentlemen: during thoce ton yeare from
1911 ta 1921 was there ever -a cry raised in
the land against emigration ta the United
States? Nat that I knaw of. And still wc
have the bnital, the absolutely irrefutable
proof, that during those ten years we lost,
every ycar, nos rly a quarter of a millian
peaple-227,000. Still nobody was anxious;
nabody even noticed it.

ubu

But what .has happened within the last two
years? Why has there heen such a cry al
over the land? Why? Because our people
were going by the train-load to the United
States; why, we have seen in Quebec the
provincial Government straining ail its efforts
to, stem the tide. We have seen the wholc -of
the clergy ini my province raising 'their voice
in alarm, why? It was hecauce the movement
in 1923 and 1924 was very much more seriaus
than it had ever been. And I put it to you,
what reason is there -to-day ta apply a different basis of appreciation ta the statisties
of the United States for 1923 and 1924 than
for the decade from 1911 ta 1921? I do not
know of any. If it is truc that those figures
had ta be multiplied by three within that
decacle in order ta rcflcct the truth, why should
they not be multiplied, likewisc to-day for
the Iast twa ycars? Ie there any reason caliing
for a different formula? I do nat know of any,
and I feel quite satisfied that there is no such
reason.
N.ow, let us apply thait multiplication to the
lasses that we have suffcred-which, unhappuly, wiIl .-ive us absolutcly the truth, and
n'othing cisc. What does it mean? 1 say ths.t
if means a frightful state of thîngs. Listen
ta this: In 1923 wc loit 102.520, multiplied' by
thrce, or 307,560. In 1924, 181,194, roiultiplied
by three, or 543,582. Let us -go beyond these
fgures. How many immigrants of the Frenchi
tangue have orosscd the line during the last
two yea.rs? During 1923 and 1924 togetherthese figures arc aieao taken from American
statistic6,--there werc 74,116, which have ta
ho mulbiplied by three, or 222,348. I believe
that the French race in this land je an asset.
I think a great many of my colcagues here
wi1 admit that while the province of Qucbc
bas its faults, it acte as a great stabilizer upon
Confederation; its people passessing the igood,
solid qualities s0 preciaus in the *making of
a big nation, staible, dccVly attached ta tihe

last years, moeecspecially, thoce qualities
have been generally recogizcd. Now, where

JUNE 4, 1925
There is another one, May 5th:
Honourable Sir:I beg ta acknowledge recept of your letter, received
yesterday.
In 1923 and in 1924, twenty-five families have left
my parish for the United States, Le., in all 151 seuls.
It is considerable on a total of 250 families: it is onetenth of the population.
However, I find that some parishes have suffered more
than mine of this score. Here, at -, we are at a
distance of only five miles from Shawinigan Falls where
our people find an easy and paying market, and in the
industries, advantageous work. Nevertheless, I have
been unable ta prevent these twenty-five families from
leaving the country.
Tell our French-Canadian senators and deputies that
they are under heavy responsibility ta our compatriotes
and, in fact to history. Tell them that we rely on
their essential support, and that if they do defend us,
on whom can we rely ta do se?
We priests certainly wish ta do our share of the
work, but our representatives et the House and at the
Senate are the leaders, and we have the right ta ask
them ta stop emigration ta the United States, if we
want ta keep our language and our institutions, and
our influence in our beautiful Canada.

There is another letter, of the 18th of May:
Honourable Sir:Three families have left for the United States in
1923-24. They are farmers who, being unable ta meet
their payments (as they are in the class of those who
cannot make any money to-day, as their products are
sold at an extremely low price) are leaving for the
United States, after having given away their farms and
the instalments already paid cn them, or go and work
in the American factories ta raise enough money ta
keep their properties. The trouble is that the Government does not bother finding a market for the sale
of the products of the farmers, who being discouraged
leave for the United States. If the situation is not
bettered, a great number of our good farmers will be
in the necessity of leaving their farms ta go and work
for a living in the American cities, or in the Canadian
towns.
I have a lot more ta say on the subject. If I were
in Ottawa, I could easily explain the situation of some
of our farmers in the county of Rimouski, at least, te
our public men.

There is another one, dated May 8th:
Honourable Sir:In reply te your letter of the lst of May, I beg ta
state that in 1923, one family only left for the United
States, and 2 in 1924.
The reason is that there are nearly ail there. Of a
population exceeding 225 families, only 114 are still
remaining here.
I must confess that I am more than anxious ta see
the barrier raised high enough.

I could go on, honourable gentlemen, but
I do not want to weary the House. The question that will arise in the minds of all is this:
" It is of course lamentable that we should bc
obliged to record such a loss, but do we not,
after all, make it up? Do we not receive
strangers? Strangers are not as good as our
own children. But what is the real truth
about immigration?" The figures are rather
depressing.
In 1923, honourable gentlemen, we received
137,320 immigrants; in 1924 we received 124,550. In the three months, January, February

and March, 1925, we received 10,792, as compared with 23,880 received in the corresponding three months of last year: A falling off
of something like 60 per cent.
Our emigration loss for 1924 was 543,000;
our gain by immigration was 124,000; our
net loss was 419,000.
The question naturally comes to your mind,
how many of the immigrants have come to
Canada simply as a jumping-off point for the
United States?
Within the last decade
practically all of them, or a number equal to
all of them, have left us, plus a substantial
portion of our natural increase.
Honourable gentlemen, how much has the
Government spent on immigration?
Last
year it spent $3,800,000. The two railways
together spent last year, in round figures,
about $3,000,000. There has been taken from
this country, directly or indirectly, no less
than $6,000,000 of our money, and as against
that we have to register a loss of over 400,000 people.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Not in one year.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: In one year-in
1924.
Now, honourable gentlemen, may I confirm this by going a little further? Is anybody in this country bothering about immigration? Have we a Minister of Immigration?
Have we a policy of immigration?
Everyone knows that last year it was trumpeted all
over the land that we were to get 3,000
selected families, all from the British Isles,
to go upon our farmes. What has happened?
The scheme has fallkn down absolutely. We
have not received that number by any means.
The number we have received is 500.
The
purpose was to fill the farms abandoned by
soldiers located on them under the Civil Reestablishment Department.
What did the
Government say then? It turned to the railways and said: "Give us some continental
families." Each railway was allowed to select
600 families. What has been the result?
That scheme too has failed-why? »On
account of restrictions in the admission of
immigrants to this country. The immigrant
is obliged to have a certain sum of moneyI think it is $500. Of that amount the Government takes $400 saying, "We are going to
administer this for you," and it keeps the $400
belonging to the immigrant. That procedure
is interpretied all over the world as a tax on
the entry of immigrants, and therefore our
immigration, in its result, has practically
broken down.
One thing that surprises me above all else
is that there are in this country associations
like those of the farmers of the West, who
have been against immigration.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
immigration?

They are against

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
Yes, associations
of farmers in the West have been against
the encouragement of immigration to this
t-ountry--why? There are, I must say, a
great many things I do not understand in
the policy followed by a certain group in
this country, but this one is to my mind the
most extraordinary and extravagant of all. In
this country, where we have over 400,000,000
of acres of arable land to be .disposed of, and
only 15 per cent under cultivation, and where
everything is predicated on the growth of
population-in this country, strange as it
may be, some of the farmers are opposed to
the increase of their numbers.
But, honourable gentlemen, I am not here
to lay the blame. If that were my only purpose, my speech would be worthy of condemnation. No: I am ready to admit that
in the past we have had our part of the
responsibility for this state of things. Parties
are not perfect. They are composed of
human beings, and human machinery is always
lacking somewhat. But I am coming to this
point. Now that we know the trouble we
are suffering from and the (lire consequences
of it, if we (1o not correct it we are remiss in
our duty. May I address myself to my own
Province through this House? I must admit
that mv Province bas heavy responsibilitv to
bear. Without it the present administration
would not live ten minutes. Without it no
policy could be even attempted by the Administration. In view of this situation may I
not address my friends from the other side
and say: Take heed while there is yet time.
If you do not believe me, I can point out to
you dozens of persons whom you will believe.
Ask them to tell you what they believe in
their conscience as to the future of this country if conditions are not improved. Conviction will very soon make its way through
your brain to your heart. And my I say to
you-and I appologize for it-there are
remedies, but they must be applied now. I
am going ta mention one that no doubt will
make you smile, but nevertheless it is sound:
"Why don't vou keep our market for our own
people?" Yes, plain protection is what I mean.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hear, hear.

lon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: There is nothing
my honourable friends opposite can use so
well as the weapon of ridicule. If you despatch the arrow of wit, which will raise a
ripple of laughter over the country, the policy
attacked is nailed and the man who upholds
it is slaughtered. I shall nat endeavor to

Mr. BEAUBIEN.

demonstrate w-bat the policy of protection
could do for the citiesHon. Mr. TURRIFF: We know what it
has donc.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: -although I might
succumb to the temptation of reading one
thing, perhaps. We know, after all, that necessity works miracles, and if my honourable
friends opposite should on account of present
alarming conditions be susceptible of finding
their road to Damascus, perhaps they might
read with profit the following
resolution
adopted yesterday by the Canadian Manufacturers' Association. Although you do not
hold that manufacturers are a verv desirable
element of the community, you forget perhaps that one-third of the population live
through their efforts, and that their products
go beyond the three billion dollar mark, whilst
the products of the farm do not exceed one
and :a half billion. Is that not a title to consideration, is that not a reason, after all, why
one's voice should be heard and one's arguments weighed in a Chamber like this? This
is the resolution which was adopted:
That a strong and stable fiscal policy is absolutely
necessary for the national development of Canada and
the welfare of the entire population; that the provision
of adequate tariff protection for all forms of Canadian
production should be the cornerstone of Canada's fiscal
system; that such a policy would bind together more
firnmly the provinces of Canada, attract capital, corniercialize national resources, strenghten existing industrics, and create new industries raise revenue, encourage immigiation,
provide
employment,
increase
tiafic through national ports, furnish passengers and
freigit for transportation systems, lower freight rates
and make farming more profitable by providing a
larger market for farm products.

And now I am going to make bold to give
mv honourable friends on the other side of the
Hou-e another authority: this time I am
going to speak of the farmer. In the policy
of the Government, the farmer apparently
occupies a very large place, and the argument
generally goes like this: "Why, we are curbing
the manufactures and forcing them to reduce
their prices; my friends, it is for you, so that
you can purchase everything at cheaper prices."
That is the argument. But may I call the
attention of my honourable friends on the
other side to an authority on agriculture-at
all events, in the Province of Quebec-an
authority that they will nat dispute? What
does the Minister of Agriculture of the Quebec
government say? The Hon. Mr. Caron. in
mtaking a speech before the Reform Club in
Montreal a few weeks ago, thought it necessary to remind his friends at Ottawa of the
necessitv of protecting the farmer. Here is
the newspaper item reproducing his speech:
Protect farmer in home market, Minister urgesCanadian tariff should equal U.S. rates on produce,

JUNE 4, 1925
says Hon. J. E. Caron-Problem can best be solved by
going to source-Danger for P.Q. cheese in English
market.

Then this follows:
Protection for the Canadian farmer against the inroads of American agricultural products into Canada
by raising the Canadian tariff to the same extent as
the American tarif had been raised against Canadian
products, was the plea which Hon. J. E. Caron, minister
of agriculture made at the Saturday luncheon of the
Reform Club. Hon. Mr. Caron, in addition to speaking
of matters political, an account of which will be found
elsewhere in this issue, reviewed the agricultural position in the province in a manner which held the close
attention of the large audience which occupied all
available space of the club rooms.
It is in the country, near te hand, that the markets
for industry lies. The farmer is your buyer. The
tariffs are against the farmers. While the Canadian
tariff has remained the same as it was as to American
products, the United States raised their barriers to
such an extent that we are practically shut out of that
country. The Americans can sell their butter to us
with a tariff of four cents a pound, and our butter
is shut out of the United States by their tarif, and,
while I believe in reciprocity-

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I will have to read
that again:
And, while I believe in reciprocity, I do claim that
until we get reciprocity we should raise our tariff on
agricultural products as high as is the tariff of the
United States on similar articles, so as to protect the
Canadian farmer, who bas a right te protection. It
may be that if Ottawa raises the tariff against American
agricultural products it will aid in bringing reciprocity
more quickly than otherwise would be the case.

Now, honourable gentlemen, perhaps you
think the honourable Minister of Agriculture
in Quebee is a freak; but what about the
honourable the Prime Minister of Quebec, and
what about the honourable Mr. David? May
I read-I dearly love to put this evidence
on record-an article from that esteemed paper
called the Gazette, which appeared in to-day's
issue:
The Liberal party in Quebec presents a curious contradiction in fiscal views. While the representatives of
the province were unanimously voting in the House
of Commons against the principle of protection, a
Minister of the local Government was extolling in
Montreal the virtues of that policy. Hon. Mr. Taschereau is an avowed protectionist; he both preaches
and practises the doctrine and has translated into
legislation his beliefs. The vast resources of the province he would conserve for Canadian use, its water
powers, its forests, and its mines, in order that employment be given the people, and industries be developed to the utmost linuit. Hon. Mr. David, Provincial Secretary, who grows in public esteem, is of the
saine fiscal faith as his leader. He is a thorough protection-ist. Speaking in Montreal on Tuesday evening,
Mr. David stressed the necessity of preserving the
water powers and forests of the province for Canadian
use and not te be employed to the gain of foreigners;
while, as to the merchants, Mr. David wondered
whether they were always to have to face competition
from goods which did not represent what they purported to represent, and thereby constituted disloyal
competition against soma national industries of Canada.
He urged encouragement of the purchase of "made in

363

Canada" goods, but if the tariff is so framed as to
prromote importation of foreign wares how can home
production succeed?

There you have tihree of the most influential
members of the Liberal Government of
Quebec, with the Prime Minister at their
head, clamouring for protection. Do you care
to know the reason why? There is a little
piece of news that may enlighten you somewhat:
Farmers of the province of Quebec are facing a loss
of about $1,500,000 this year because they have been
unable to get rid of about 4,000 cars of potatoes or
have had to sell part of the production at very low
prices.
So serious is the situation that Ottawa will be asked
to take some means of protecting the farmers against
a repetition of such a condition. A Quebec delegation
will soon waait on the federal goverment.
Official information shows that, for instance, in St.
Luce of Rimouski county, which is known as one of
the most important potato production centres in the
province, potatoes are bought at 25 cents par bag.
Last year the prices varied between 85 cents to $1.10
in the cities. It is stated that $835,498 worth of
potatoes have been imported froin the United States
into Canada, which is equal to 62,091,945 pounds. It
is understood some suggestions have been made in
Ottawa towards an embargo on potatoes coming in
from the United States and that Premier Taschereau
seems also to favor this.

I have more material on the subject, but
I am not going to give it. I have made my
argument as clear as I could. From the
farmer up-for all Canadians-le! us keep our
own markets. By doing that we keep our
own children. Thait, honourable gentlemen,
must be the foundation either of the success
or of the failure of Canada.
May I now briefly make a suggestion? A
few months ago, honourable gentlemen, in
Montreal I heard General Dawes, who is at
the head of the Budget Bureau of the United
States. In a half-hour speech he explained
admirably how the expenses of the United
States Government within the last two years
had been redùuced by half-and why? Because tihe principle underlying the apportionment af money had been changed: instead of
going to the different departments, as had
been the practice in the past, and saying,
"How much do you want?" they went to the
different departments and said: "This is what
we can give you; we have to live within our
means and not beyond them, and you will
have to do the best you can with what we
give you." Is that not common sense? How
long can we continue to spend as we do?
How long can we continue to increase our
debt and still bear it? I hald, honourable
gentlemen, that now is the time for us to
sink or swim; and we will only swim if we
can get rid of the sinkers that are accumulating so rapidly around our necks.

364

SENATE

In this regard may I also refer to the railway problem? For those who have heard the
remarkable evidence given before the Special
Committee of this House on Railway Expenditures, there is in my opinion but one
conclusion to be drawn, namely, to sell the
National Railway. Sel it; let us make our
loss now, with the chance of recouping later
on what we can of it. But, honourable gentlemen, if we continue to be bled on that
score. as we have been in the past; we cannot swim much longer and must sink. As
time goes by it will be more and more difficult
to sel our railway, because the Canadian
National is carrying on a formidable propaganda in favour of government ownership.
Everybody knows that. Why, honourable gentlemen. it is being drilled into the minds of
the people: "Keep your own railway; encourâge your own railway; pay fares to vourselves."
And when the day comes when Canada will
have to sell its railway-

cannot sel their products; yet we buy Swiss
products. Is that reasonable?
I have drawn a pretty dark picture. Everyone who is sincere will say, that it must be
a dark picture, and I have left it in its true
colours. I want my own compatriots to see
it; othecrwie my appeal will be lost. The
naked sombre truth must be seen now, for if
not sceen now it will be to late. Canadians
must rise above party affilitioons. Now is the
tine for thena to think about the country
and its future. Will they do it?
What a future there is in store for us, after
all; we cannot forget it. We have got the
richest country in the world in natural resources. Think of it: 13,000 miles of fishing
coast line. nearly half the belt of the whole
world. Where do you find forests like ours?
We

We have reserves of coal greater by 60 per
cent than all the coal reserves of Europe. There
is only one country in the world richer than
Canada in coal: it is the United States. Where
can you find hydro-electric power like ours19.000.000 horse-power, capable of developing
41,000.000? Where have you seen such a race
a- ours, after all; in time of peoce or time
of war? What have we done in industry in
developing and administering this enormous
demain of ours? We have raised ourselves,
by our per capita production, to the first rank
among the people of the world. For several
years we were the first people in the world
for exportation per head.
Will you allow me just to show you what
we have done? With half of one per cent
of the population of the world, this is what
Canada has done. It has produced:

gentlemen, the subject that the honourable
Hon.

Mr. BEAUBIEN.

JUNE 4, 1925
gentleman from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) has introduced this afternoon is of such
vital importance to our country that I feel it
merits a still further discussion from a wider
viewpoint and from more widely spread parts
of the country than my honourable friend has
referred to in detail.
Some weeks ago, when the budget was
under discussion in another place, emigration
was discussed to some extent, and I thinki the
House and the country were amazed at statements made by certain Ministers of the
Crown on the subject of -,migration and
immigration, particularly that of emigration
of Canadian people to the Unied States.
Immediately following that occasion, some
inquiries came to me respecting the correctness
of, the statements, and, anticipating that it
might become a topic of discussion, and not
desiring to assume to express merely my own
views as the facts, I communicated with a
substantial number of men throughout the
country representing the working classes, who
have largely been the victims of this tide of
emigration. I am not going to deluge the
House with the replies, because it would take
a couple of days to put them on record, but I
want for a few moments to supplement what
my honourable friend from Montarville has
said with reference to this difficulty. My honourable friend the leader of the Government
interjected the remark that the Government
last year took steps to stem this tide of
emigration from Canada.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, my remark
did not bear on that; it was on a system of
control as to the passing of emigrants across
the line. I know that some regulations were
adopted last year which were new in Canada
since Confederation, but I have sent for those
regulations to ascertain exactly what they
are.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have had
opportunity to get at the facts, and I find
them to be about as follows: that in 1923
some honourable members of Parliament
became interested in the question of the
unusual exodus of Canadian people to the
United States, and began to gather information, which they had to obtain from American
records. When those figures were brought to
the attention of Parliament, and were found
in 1924 to be conitantly increasing, the
Government of the day did take cognizance
of the situation, and I am informed made
some representations to the United States
Government which resulted in added restrictions and new regulations being adopted.

365

Prior to July lst, 1924, a Canadian going
to the United States was required to pay a
head tax of $8. After that date a Canadian
citizen was required, in addition to paying
the $8, to go to the nearest United States
Consul and make certain affidavits, for which
he paid that official $10: then he could go
to the border and make application for entry
into the United States. Very few of the
prospective emigrants knew of these regulations for many months. I have peisonal
knowledge of some cases.
I may mention one case from a near-by
town, Cornwall, which is only 50 miles from
Ottawa. This man, with his wife and four
children, went to Windsor in order t o cross
into the United States at Detroit. He was
net permitted to go before the United States
Consul at Windsor and take his affidavits
and get his papers, because the reguiations
required that that must be done at the office
of the Consul nearest to his place of residence.
He was therefore forced to leave his wife and
children at a hotel at Windsor, and return to
Cornwall in order to get the necessary papers,
and he had to pay his transportation expenses
as well as the cost of maintaining his wife
and family meanwhile, in addition to the
tax of $10. That is a sample of the benefit
to Canadian citizans from the new regulations,
which I do not think have had the eflect of
restricting emigration to the United States.
A news dispatch appearing in the Montreal
Standard of March 19 states that from July
1, 1924 to January 31, 1925, a period of 7
months,.72,371 Canadian citizens went to the
United States. This means a cost ta them,
in cash, of $723,000, in addition to the head
tax that was formerly imposed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Surely my
honourable friend does not complain of that?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I complain that
the increased restrictions which were imposed
by the American authorities at the instigation
of the Government of Canada have had the
effect, within those 7 months, of putting into
the treasury of the United States Government
three-quarters of a million dollars, taken out
of the pockets of Canadian citizens without
the least benefit to the citizens involved.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But that was
an impediment to their leaving Canada.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Certainly; but I
ask the House if that is the proper method of
attempting to remove the difficulty. If a restriction of $1,000 were imposed, the principle
would be the same, and it would absolutely
prevent a 'Canadian citizen, unable to obtain

SENATE

366

employment and make a living for his dependents here. from going where he could do
so. I question if the people of Canada would
approve of any such ipolicy, and I say that the
one th-it has been adopted is exactly the
sane in principle as that would have been.
But the quota
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
was established on the American side.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: This is entireiy
apart from the quota lIaw. The quota has
been, since some time in January, 1924, imposed against all non-Canadian-born citizen.
Although they may be naturalized Canadian
citizens, they cannot go into the United States.
I will give my honourable friend a concrete
case. There is a part of the Canadian National
railway between Winnipeg and Fort William
that runs for about 50 miles through the State
of Minnesota. around the south shore of the
Lake of the Woods--what is known as the
Port Arthur and Winnipeg division of the
railway. In that 50 miles there are four or
five stations, each of which has one or two,
somet.imes three, men eiployed. As it is a
part of the Canadian division, those men
take their promotion and seniority rates from
point to point. In a recent instance, a telegraph operator had, under an agreement with
the railway company, the right to take a certain station. He was a Canadian-born citizen,
but his wife unfortunately, was born in some
other country. He was promoted te go ýdown
there and take the job, but his wife could net
glot with him because of those restrictions.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
restrictions.

I commend the

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Very well, if that
is my honourable friends view.
If it prevents
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Canadiauns from crossing over the border.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Is my honourable
friend certain that it was the Canadian Government that asked the American Government
to put on that additional tax of S10 for the
cortificate from the American Consul?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I can give my
honourable friend some information in that
connection. In the instance of the man from
Cornwall who went to Detroit, and in some
other instances of a similar nature that I know
of, at the same port, the emigrants who were
inconvenienced in that way were told by the
American immigration officers at Detroit:
"This is no fault of ours, or of the American
Covernment, but it is because of a request
made last June by the Government of CanHon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

ada to Washington." Honourable gentlemen
who have attended the Committee meeting
with some of us, and have recently been hearing information given by witnesses, know,
know that the very influential gentlemen who
aippeared before the Committee the other day
indicated that such was the fact.
Without going into all this evidence in something over 100 letters that have come to me,
I think it has been well established that there
has been an absolutely alarming exodus of
Canadians to the United States. I do not
think we need to read from their evidence to
prove that that is true. I could read to the
House letters from every province in Canada-not confined to one province with which
my honourable friend from Quebec has dealt
with so fully and so well-to supplement and
amplify the proofs tiat he has submit-ted
that those same conditions exist in every province; but the information which I have deals
more particularly with the industrial population than the agricultural.
ýMay I state what I feel to be some of the
The Dominion
caies of this emigration?
Bureau of Statistics issued a report a little
while ago showing that there were in the industries in 1924. 9,169 fewer men permanently
employed on the railways than was the case
in December, 1923. Why was that? Principally because during that same year the gross
earnings of our Canadian railroads fell by a

tlemen will refer to the May issue of the
"Canadian National Railways''-a journal issued every month-they will sec that the
cperating expenses of the National Railways
alone diminished by $14,500,000 last year,
while the gross earnings diminished by $17,500.000. Out of that $14.500.000 of decreased
expenses. $10.217,000 of the decrease in operating expenses, of which every dollar is wages,
represents a loss to the 9,169 men who were
thrown out of omplcyment because of the
$30,000.000 decrease of revenues. But why did
the revenues decrease?

And the presi-

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No: I want to
correct my honourable friend, because he was
present when the question wa.s asked of both
railway presidents, who testified that the

JUNE 4, 1925
amount of revenues derived from the handling of the grain was cornparatively small,
and made only a sinall portion of the $30,000,000 referred te.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Oh, that is
ancther question; but the short crop produced
the result which 1 mentioned.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No . I arn coming to that. If my honourable friend will
refer to previous article* in the monthly
journal, he will flnd specifie mention of the
fact 'that the losses were largely due- I think
that the President of the Canadian Pacifle
said were principally due-to the contraction
in industrial aetivity. In my opinion, that
contraction is the basis of most of the diffculty.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I would like
my honourable friend to suýbstantiate that,
because our export returns show the very
contrary.
Hon. MT. ROBERTSO'N: Oh, no. Perhaps
1 can give my honourable friend a littie in,formation on that matiter. I amn sorry 1 have
not the figures up to date. These were coinpiled tiwo or three months ago, before tihe end
of the fiscal year. 'Our imuports andl e:xports
for tihe year etnding Deceinber 3lst, 1924,
where $1,M6,000,000, and for the year 1923 they
were $1,921,000,000. There was -a dorease i-n
our t-atal trade as between 1923 andl 1924 of
$57,000,000. If I recollect correctly, a similar
co>mpariýson brought d'own to the end of the
fiscal year, MarCh 3lst, 1925, shows that the
net loss in total trade of Canada was $75,000,000, which is8reflected in a drop of 83W,000,000
in the grossB earnings of our rai'Iways.
May I say in passing, and as an aside, th-at
I recaîl very well how this has been cxplained
by 'membeTs of the Governiment. In a byelection that occurred not very lon(g ago -a
member of the Government got up before a
large audience of railroad men and toid them
that the reýason there was a decrease in the
1
numlber of men employed in that, railroad
town, which was on tihe National Railways,
was the consoqid'ation of the Canadian Northern and the Grand Trunk. Now, the consolidation of the ýCanadian Northern aud the
Grand Trunik ocurred before 1924, it occurred
at the end of 1,923. Noîtwith.dtanding the faot
that consolidation heal been in effec.t more
tihan a ye'ar, we stili found a dvap of 9,000 in
the number of men employed. It is absolutely fooliih, it is deceitfua, it is unifair, it je
untrue, to say that, anything but tihe decerease
in the gross eaxlnings and in the grose tonnage
carried 'has 'been responisible for the decreage
in em.p1oy'ment.

Let us turn now to a hranch of the business
with which I arn particularly familiar-the
Staition and Telegraph Service. A few days
ago I happened to meet *a represenftative of
the telegraphers' organlization of the Caaiadian
National Railway lices, West. I want to show
the effect of the contraction in railway
&-etivities and railway business on that olass

somewhat, similar: out cf a total of 391 the

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would my hioncurable friend suggest as a remedy that we

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I will tell my

how the Governmen-t can hope to obtain any
good result from a policy cf that sert, because
when a man is for any reason out cf employment he is forced te go, and must go, where

SENATE
he can obtain it. What I suggest as a remedy
is that employment should be provided at
home.
Now, how can that be done? I go partly
along the lines of my honourable friend from
Montarville. I had the opportunity, and indeed the privilege, as I deemed it, to be a
member of a Tariff Commission making inquiry into the whole fiscal subject of this
country in 1920. It was a new experience for
me, because I had not been connected with
activities which brought me into touch with
that question before; but because it was of
intimate and vital interest to probably a million or more industrial workers in Canada,
I did endeavour to obtain an intelligent and
fair understanding of the facts, and of the
effect of tariff upon business. At the end of
that investigation I came to this conclusionI have never changed my mind upon it and
do not anticipate that I ever shall-that there
should be, in 1921, or as quickly as it could
be brought about,-for it is a very intricate
and voluminous task to revise all the items
in a tariff-a substantial upward revision in
regard to many articles. There were some
few that perhaps were high enough. In fact,
there may have been one or two that could
have baen readjusted in the other direction.
However, the general necessity was a subBecause 32 other

nations of the world had increased their restrictions and raised their barriers against us
after the war. In addition to raising their
tariff barriers against Canada, against our
workmen and our products, they had a still
further advantage: the value of the money
of foreign countries was so depreciated that
the so-called tariff protection, which was the
law in Canada then, and still is, was absolutely wiped out, and the Canadian manufacturer and the Canadian workman had absolutely no protection at all in hundreds and
hundreds of instances.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF:
Why did not the
Government of which my honourable friend
was a member fake action in 1921? They
were in power until November or December.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That is a very
fair question.
I will give my honourable
friend, I think, a fair answer. That inquiry
concluded on the 7th day of December, 1920.
There was absolutely no time to perform so
tremendous a task as a revision of the whole
tariff before Parliament met. It would have
been donc in the year 1921 nd would have
been submitted to Parliament in the Session
of 1921-22. had it not occurred that in August
or 'September 1921 the Prime Minister announced dissolution and a general election

to change their Government. I say to the
House, and to anybody who is interested, that
in the winter of 1921-22, had it not bee'
for the change of Government, there would
have been, in my opinion, a substantial upward general revision of the tariff, which
would have prevented the necessity of hindreds of thousands of Canadian workmen and
their families abandoning their homes and
losing in many cases their equity in them,
and being exiled to a foreign land to find
employment.
Hon. Mr. DANIDURAND: But that is only
a sin of omission. My honourable friend has
two sins of commission, because he helped
to reduce the tariff after 1918 and before 1921.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No. The tariff
was not reduced twice, in a general way at
all.
Oh, yes. there
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
were two cuts made by my honourable
friend's colleagues.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My honourable
friend refers, of course, to the war taxation,
as to which the Government thought it could
relieve the taxpayers to some extent; but that
did not interfere in any way with the tariff
as it stood before the war. My honourable
friends have found it advisable and necessary
to increase taxation in other forms, but have
not donc it through the tariff.
There are many ways other tlan by a
tariff itself, in which protection can be given
to an industry, whether it be to the employers
or to the workmen, who are both concerned,
the workmen being much more concerned than
the employers. Take the United States, for
example. There is no duty on shoes enterWhy should they

have any duty? They have no fear of competition when they manufacture in such
tremendous quantities. Their costs are smaller
than ours-necessarily and naturally so.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF:

Why?

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: From last year,
for example, there was a demand in the
United States for hockey boots. People do
not skate much in the United Sta.tes, especially since Mr. Volstead took up his residence
there. There having been not muclh ice, there
has never been any manufacture of hockey
boots in that country on an extensive scale.
There was imported into the United States
between $100,000 and $200,000 worth of hockey
boots. What did the United States Customs
authorities do? There being no tariff on boots

JUNE 4, 1925
to protect the United States manufacturer,
they declared hockey boots to be sporting
goods and charged 30 per cent on them. That
is a sample af how it is possible to protect
your workmen and your inidustries if the
Govcrnment makes the attempt. But, instead
of that, what is going on? By every opportunity that there is, by methods just as
devious as that, or perhaps more so, it is
being made easier to bring the produets of
the cheap labour of other countries into Canada and to put them on the market, while
the workmen of this country waik the streets
and their families go hungry. I say to the
<3overnment that it is a matter of vital importance to tbe Province tha-t my honourable
friend from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien)
adorns. There is probabiy no part of Canada in which the population is more homeloving or more desirous of prospering and
living peaceably in its own environment than
in tbe Province of Quebec. I bed the pleasure
of living in that Province for nearly six years.
Having been born and raised in the western
part of Ontario, and 'having bad no opportunity up to that time of coming into contract with or knowing our compatriots in
Queber, I want to say that it was an experience not only interesting. but highly delightful, to comne into contact with a people
such as the French Canadians. I think it is
true that there is no claffs of citizens in Can.
ada whose loss to the Dominion is greater
than that of our native-born French Canadiens. On the other hand, most of the emigration that has 'been going from other
provinces of -Canada is composed of skilled
:artisans who can command good wages for
their services and who go elsewhere to get
such wages. In most instances such artisans
are rearing families, and those families have
in many cases been educated in our public
and high sehools. Away goes the fatber, and
takes his family with him. After we have
incurred the cost of edu.cating them and of
training that artisan until he has become
skilled, in his trade and becomes a valuable
citizen, they go away to another country,
which gets the benefit of ail the expenditure
that has been made upon themn here. Therefore there are lef t in our industrial population
those who are least capable, or et any rate
least ambitious of making their way in competition with workmen in other countries.
In place of the best of our artisans we are
receiving a small measure of immigration. My
view of the picture is not quite that as represented by my honourable friend from Montarville; but I find that between the years 1923
2nd 1924 there was a discrepancy of about
S--24

100,000. By months the emigration shows a
graduai rise from 3,000 people in January
1922 to 19,177 in the month of June, 1924.
This is only the recorded emigration. During
those two years, according to the American
official figures, 351,109 people entered the
United States legitimateiy through the immigration officers. During those same two years
Canada received from ail countries of the
worid 261,770 people, and expended epproximately $3,500,000 a ye-ar on immigration. Is
it not important from the standpoint of taxetion, that our population be kept et home?
Hon. Mr. BEATJBIEN:
May 1 ask my
honourabie friend to beer with me for just a
second? 1 suppose ho is aware that the figures
given by the United States are only those of
persons registering ns Canadiens.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTION: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: And ail the others
who leave our country to go to the United
States are registered as of their country of
origin. Therefore the number would be very
much greater.
Hon. Mr,. RO>BERTSON: Secretary Davis
niakes the statement that during the past
three years there have come into the United
States, he estimates, 700,000 people fromý
'Canada. A very substantiel proportion of
those have of course entered clandestinely, ns
we 'have evidence that people have been
crossing the frontier at Detroit and Niagiara
et the rate of 100 e day, being srnuggied in
for a price. So it is difficult to comprehend
fuliy the bass of this kind of emigration to
Canada. The legitirnate, known immigration
into the United States amounts to 500 persons a day. We -hear the question discussed,
what shaîll we do with our railroads? Shaîl
we seli themn or not? I do not know bow
we are going to, seil tbem if we wish to do so.
I do submit thet the primary thing we should
attemnpt to, do is to ýadopt a national policy
the effeet of which wiil be to keep oui, population, to, increase it, to increase our railroad
traffie and therefore decrease our deficit; and
1 think that the attention of the country is
rapidly being turned in that direction. 1
think that the business interests of Canada,

of workmen who, beoause of the policy that

in their shoes as to whether Vhey are going

I apologize to the House for having taken
so much time on this question; but I would
say to any or all honourable gentlemen who
care to examine this volume of evidence that
I have here, showing the detailed knowledge
and experience of representative men all
through the country, in every province and
almost every city, that I should be delighted
to place this evidence at their disposal. If
they will examine into the details, thev will
satisfy themselves that they are bona fide
and truc, and that some of the statements
made are indeed touching as well as correct.
I hope that the Government will give some
recognition to the very forceful presentation
on this question by my honourable friend
from Montarville and will at least take the
trouble to review and investigate some of
my statements for themselves. If they do so
they will surely come to the conclusion that
there is need for action on their part.
Honourable
DANDURAND:
R.
Hon.
gentlemen, I confess that I am somewhat
grieved at the tone of the speeches which I
have heard from the two honourable members
to whom we have listened this afternoon. I
am afraid that this will not be conducive to
increased confidence in this country. I may
quote Sir Vincent Meredith, the President of
the Bank of Montreal, who returned to Canada lately, and who stated tha.t it was a pity
in a foreign land to bear the constant wails
that come from Canada. I do not believe
that they are justified. The state of our
trade shows a healthy condition. My honourable friend from Montarville (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien) has told us what Canadians can do.
They are still on the job; they are still working; they are producing and developing our
industries; they are meeting with difficulties.
but they are facing them like men. I do not
know why there should be that wave of
pessimism through the ranks of my honourable friends on the other side. I cannot accept
conditions as they are painted; I do not admit
the truth of the picture.
Mr. honourable friend from Montarville has
cited some letters from parish priests whom
he has consulted, and who have told him that
there has been a desertion from the land. But
we have heard of that for the last 75 years
in Canada; and when my honourable friend
says that a responsible Minister in the Commons, in speaking of the various problems that
confronted Canada, mentioned for the first
time the possibility of annexation to the
United States-which he repudiated'-he shows
his youth, because I remember some 40 years
ago a very esteemed Minister from the
Province of Quebec, who represented the

retaining our people in the Province of Quebec,

United States, with the formidable wage scale
in force there, which is a very tempting one.
The quota having been fixed against European
immigration, and not applied to Canadian
immigration, with the prevailing price of
labour in the United States, it is no surprise
that some of our people should be tempted
to go there to take advantage of a wage
which I dare not mention because I do not
want to add to the publicity already given to
it.
Everbody within the sound of my voice
knows the figures.
My honourable friend has read a letter from
a curate in a parish five miles outside of
Shawinigan, who says: "Forty families have
left my parish who could have received a
good wage in Shawinigan mills." They were not
tempted; they were attracted by some relatives on the other side of the line who had

We stand faced, with that difficulty; we are
suffering from that situation; yet we carry
on.
My honourable friend de3ires to stress bis
point with statistics. sayinz that tbey show
a fearful condition. I s'iw the stitement some
time ago that, if we took the statistics from
Washington for the Iast 30 years, and accepted
tbem as being true, without multiplying tbem
by 3, as my honourable friend has done, there
would remain practically no Canadians on this
side of the line. And yet Canada has a population of 9,000,000 hardy men who wake in
the *morning with the idea of flot ]ying down
again until their work is done. We are ail
proud of them wbien we look at the sum total
of the work of our people on the farm and in
the factory.
Some three or four years ago I wrote to
the Minister of Agriculture, whom my honourable ifriend quoted, the Hon. Mr. Caron,
to communîcate to him what I thougbt weuld
be an inducement to members of the farming
community to rernain on the land--some suggestions for making life in the country parts
more attractive. He answered me that it was
ail an economic problemn-that so long as the
cities offered $5 or $6 a day for eight hours
work it would be mighty hýard to keep the
mai ority of our sons on the farm working 12
to 14 hours a day and receiving a meagre
return by comiparison. Added tc this condition, whicb we must face
we now bave the
Uited States o.ffering double the wage that
Canadian employers can offer: hence the resuit that we find to-day in some of the statistics. Yet I arn convinced that there is a
movement of people returning, as well as of
tjhose who go.
It bas been stated this afternoon that there
is an invisible emigration. I believe that
tbere is also an invisible imm,.grtion-that
people leave and remain away for a few
months, maybe a year or more, and then
returo. The laist census, it is true, aiyparently
shows that we have lost a part of our increase in population if we include in the
reckoning the increased immigration that we
have had; yet 1 have confidence that, despite
the difficuity and despite that formidable, magnet on the other side, our Canadians will
continue to develop and prosper.
It bas been said that if we increased production we would increase the value of our
domestie market, and would thercby keep our
people at home. Even if the rcmedy whicb
is suggested would increase the population,
it would probably increase it in the cities
to the detriment of the rural parts. If there
were work in the towns and cities, the rural
parts would be decreased pro tanto, and that
S-24J

wvould not increase or belp to maintain thbe
population that we bave on the land. We
bave our domestie market and we have been
selling abroad. Wýe are cultivating foreign
markets. We tried in 1911 to open tbe Amnencan market to our natural products in order te
belp the farm, and we ai! know that tbe
Liberal party went down on that policy. I
would be ready again to, test tbe opinions of
tbe people of Canada on the question of
reciprocity in natural produets. I had occasion to say that twenty years prior to tbe
1911 election Sir John A. Macdonald submitted reciprocity in natural products as bis
policy. The Liberal party at that time were
in favour of unlimited reciprocity. Sir John
opposed that with reciprocîty restricted to
natural produets. Ia February of 1891 the'
whole of Canada voted for recîproeity in
natural products, because it was the Conservative programme whicb carried, and the
Liberals in voting for unrestnictcd reciprocity
impliedly voted for reciprocity in natural products. In 1911 restnicted reciprocity went
down. I believe it would bave been a consgiderable boon to Canada.. and I believe that
to-day reciprocity in natural produets with the
United States would be a boon. This may
be denied, but I amn convinced that, if a
referendum were taken on that simple question, entirely removed from, the contingency
of an election, three-quarters of the people
of this country would vote in favour of
reciprocity in natural products with the
United States. From, 1854 to 1866 sucli a
policy had made prosperity for Canada, and
the generation of men wbo bad seen that
result-and tbere are stili scme in this
Chamber-feit, up to 1911, tbnt reciprocity
was thbe policy whicb would again briag prosperity to our country.
Well, that policy was rejected in 1911, and
today we are facing conditions that we aill
know. The UJnited States is a highiy proteeted
country', and yet, fionouralble gentlemen, wben
you look into the figures what do you find?

the whole farm population bas lived upon the
products of the farm, and that if its consump,ion were added to the amount of the sales
of farm products, farming would be shown
to be by far the largest industry.
I draw the attention of my honourable
friend to the fact that in making his comparison between the farming industry and other
industries he is obliged to bulk together all
the other industries against farming. Take
all the various activities of the industries of
Canada; treat them separatelly, and then compare the r products with the products of the
farming industry. As a whole. the farming
industry, I believe, is still the largest, and we
must not, tbrourh protection, make the cost
of living in this country too high.
We knowv the problem ni governing this
country. The United States had the same
problem. The West for a num-ber of years
resented the 'hiab cost of industrial products
that was levied upon it iby the East. To-day
we have the snme sentiment in our Canadian
West. Not only have we got it 'in the Canadian West but we have it in -the Maritime
Provinces. Men of high standing in both parties in the Maritime Provinces complain of
the high tariff workinc detrimentally to their
Provinces, and the cry is made there. as in

them. The farmers of the West contend tbat

to reduce freight rates and give them a margin

locked at their annual reports, and I do not
find in these any indication of fear that they
are insufficiently protected. No: they enjoy
a certain anount of protection; they can hold
their own; they are paying dividends; and it
is but a very small section of the manufacturers of this country whom we hear wailing and complaining and asking for greater
protection.
There is a danger, honourable gentlemen, in
increasing duties to those who are not in
absoluto need of temporary help from the
public treasury and the private purse as well.
J know of cases in which the consumer bas
suffered through the fact that the manufacturer has too large a margin. A way must
be found for taking into consideration the
conumer as well: he is an important factor,
and his class forms the vast majority in this
country. The farmer is among them, and I

more in the Canadian market than be does to

I know what bas passed in the United
States. Therc is a clear indication among the
manufacturers in that country that the American consumer pays at least 25 per cent more
for his goods than the foreigner pays for similar goods sold abroad. Manufacturers in the
United States have admitted this to mesome with pangs of conscience or some uneasiness-and I say to the Canadian Senate,
before you bind yourselves to a higher tariff
policy, think twice, and remember that the
consumer must be considered.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
sure about that.

I am not so

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: From my honourable
friend's sfatement most people would gather
that the agricultural production was very much
less than the industria'l, which they would
read as manufacturing.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: But the products of
the fisheries and of the mines and forests.
where sold as raw materials, are not in the
same sense industrial as the manufacturing,
and I would ask my honourable friend to give
the total value of the manufactured goods as
compared with the agricultural.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
I brought these
figures simply to show that the association
of men called the Canadian Manufacturers
Association represented a very formidable interest in Canada.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF:

No doubt about that.

Hon. Mr. GORDON:
Do statistics show
that only 5 per cent of the manufacturers are
dissatisfied with the tariff?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I have given
that because I think that I am very generous.
I do not believe there are 5 ýper cent.
At 6 o'clock the Senate took recess.
The Senate resumed at 8 o'clock.
CLAIMS FOR WAR
CANADIAN
DAMAGES IN PERSIA
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY inquired of the
Government:
Does the Government intend to make any provision
for adjustment and settlement of claims of Canadians
who were British subjects for damages to personal property suffered in Persia at the hands of Turkish
troops operating there during the Great War and subsequent te August 1, 1914, such claims not coming under
the provisions of the Convention signed the 23rd November, 1923. and made pursuant to Article 58 of the
Treaty of Lausanne.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The Canadian
Manufacturers Association
comprises
the
people who work our forests and mines and
fisheries; I know that. There is only one part
of the population that does not include the
agriculturists proper. Therefore I am perfectly
right when I put them aside. I show the
farmers' exclusive production. The Canadian
Manufacturers Association covers alil the
other industries. Therefore I am entitled to
show the products of all such industries
grouped together in the Manufacturers Association. That is 'all that I meant, and it
is the truth.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Claims of British subjects in Canada for
damages suffered in Persia through the operatiens of Turkish troops since the lst of
August, 1914, are of the same class as those
within the categories set out in the Annex
following Article 244 of the Treaty of Versailles, and will be similarly dealt with.

Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Even the Government tells us 'that only 5 per cent of the
manufacturers are fin'ding fault.

DAIRY INDUSTRY BILL

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Not 5 per cent.

Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: They are satisfied with the conditions of the tariff as it
is?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: 95 'per cent are
satisfied; that is a pretty good proportion.
ýCertainly I have
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
great respect for the affirmation of the honourable leader on the other side of the House;
but I would call his attention to this, that
not one fact has been cited by me without the
quotation of my authority; and I think he will
spend a lot of midnight oil in finding a
shadow of authority for the statement that 95
per cent of our Canadian manufacturers are
satisfied with the tariff.

APPOINTMENT 0F SENATE OFFICIALS
MOTION AND DISCUSSION

The Senate resumed fromn June 2 the ad-

j ourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Daniel:
TIsaI in the opinion cf tIse Senate the appointaent
cf aIl officers occupying seats on tIse fdccc cf the Senate,
to whocn tIse Civil Service Act appîdes, sIsould be
selected and appointeS ba' the Senate, and that thse
Civil Service Commission should be asked 10 exclude
those positions from. the operation cf tIse Civil Service
Act.

Hon. Mr. FISHER: Honourable gentlemen who were in the Senate on Tuesday will
perhaps remem.ber that when the motion of
the honourable memnber from St. John was
read I moved an amendment, anid the bionourab'e leader of the House and two other
honourable gentlemen on the other side asked
that the matter be allowed to stand until
thev lad reoeived some further informationi..
I find on looking at the Orders of the Day
and in the Minutes of Proceedings of the
Seate tînat the aiendment is flot printed.
Probably it was my own fault in not putting
it in writing. I presumne, however, that I
have the right again to introduce this amendment and consequently I will move, seconded
by Hon. Mr. Smith:
That in the opinion cf the Senate ail cfficera occupa'ing scats on the Ileor cf the Senate sIsculd bie selected
and appointed ha' tIse Senate. .

Hon. Mr. DANDTJRAND: Perhaps before
the bonourable gentleman submaits hie motion, as hie bas the right te do, 1 might submit te the Senate the documents that I
promised on Tuesday last. Then the bonourable gentleman may wish to postpone the
matter, or will take whatever *action lie
p!eases. I intervene now, before the amendment is put, in order that the honourable
gentleman may decide for himself whetber te
press bis amendiment or postpuone it. I stated
the other day that tbe Civil Service Commission had released the position of the Black
Rod, and it has done so under a letter, a
copy of which reads as follows:

matter with rny henourable friend wheo faces

which w-e may turn over ie ouir minds, the

Hon. 5r JAMES LOUGHEED: Ne. My
impression is that it is eetirely determineti

sugzcst. was that w-e sheuid ask the Law
Cierli et the Seeste te asseciate himseif with
the Law Officers et the Crewvn, and te pressait
te themn tho views et the Senate upon the
legal question as te where the power et appeintment lies; ie that way we sheuld be

JUNE 4, 1925
represented, se to speak, in the presentation
of our views. I quite, agree with my honourab4le friend that it would -be very undesirable, te attem.pt to put any resolution through
the House if there be doubt upon the subject. However. the resolution which has been
moved by my honourable friend the Chairman of the Interrnai Economny Comsnittee
(Hon. Mr. Daniel) and amended by my honourable friend from Paris (Hon. Mr. Fisher)
is but -a modest request, and I think practically embodies the view of every member of
this House in regard te the appointment of
offieeq's of this House.
However, the correspondence which my
honourab-le friend read wiil appear in Hansard, and by the next meeting of the Senate
we will have had an opportunitýy of peru.sing
th'ose letters, and possibly of presenting our
views upon them.
I may make
Hon. MTe. DANDURAND:
this statement to my honourable friend-I
do net know in what spirit he will receive
it-that the Council can only act through
an exchange cf views which form a tentatie
resolution. There, will be ne such exchunge
of views which eould he transferred to the
Law Officers of the Crown as embiracing the
opinion cf the Council. My honourable friend
understands what 1 mean. This document
will go te the Law Officers cf the Crown
purely nnd simply, without any recommendatien; while the Law Officers of the Crown
may have te take cognizance cf the fact that
there bas been a dehate in. the Senate, they
will have ne inkling of any debate in the
Council.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It seeme
te me that the preceeding of the Prime Minister in apiproadhing the Civil Service Commission is entirely irregular and conltaary te
thp provisions in the statute. The recommendation or the first approach to the Civil
Service Commission should have been made
by bis Honour the Speaker. The vacancy
occurred bore, and bis Ieonour the Speaker
sh.oulid have preipared the report.
Hon. Mr. DANDIJRAND: Is that in virtue
of section 34?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUTGHEED: Yes, I
think it is; 34. I fail te understand how this
movement was initiated by the Primie Minister. There is nothing in the Act te warrant
the Prime Minîster putbing the Civil Service
Commission in motion on the subject.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not remember how the Prime Minister was seized
cf the question, but te my mind it does net
matier very much. There may be a question

377

as to who should have precodence. but it does
not matter very mucli how the Civil Service
C-ommiiasion was approached, inasmucli as it
couki aùt of its own volition.
Hon. Mr. BEIQIJE: Hortourable gentlemen, the other day on the spur of the moment I expressed an opinion on tihe queStion,
and in doi'ng se 1 was, influenced by my recollection of wha-t passed in this flouse
several years ago in discussing the Civil Service Act. My recollection was, and still is,
thait there was an oipinion very strongly expressed by a numiber of members of this
Hous to the effect that bdth. branches of
Parliarnent should retain the nomination of
their own emiffioyees. After the sitting of
the House, for my own satisfaction I looked
into the question, and 1 must say thit I came
to the conclusion that the opinion I had expressed during the sitting required to be consideraibly amended. I woul therefore suggest that this question, which is quite an important one, should be permitted to mature,
and that both the leaders cf this honourable
flouse shouil have a conference with the
honouraibdè the Speaker. te, be assigted in
any formai way, if they think it advisable, by
the Law Clerk of the Senate and somae officer
of the Laçi Department, to see whether they
cannot arrive at a una.nimous conclusion. If
that is doute, I think they wibl find that they
can agree upon a solution cf the question.
Hon. Mr. DANDUTRAND: My honourable
friend was not in the ýChamber when I read
the report cf the Civil Service Commission.
As a conditilon they state:
That the said position, so far as the impending appointmsent is concerned, be wholly excluded f rom the
operation of the Civil Service Act;
That the appointment thereto ha vested in the coinpetent authority in that behaif to be determained. and
noncnted by the Law Officers of the Crown.

iSo this Order in Ceujicil will in its naturel
course g-o te the La.w Officers of the Crown.
I sneigested thiat the law officer of the Senate
bc asked te conufer with. the Law Officers of
the Crewn and peesent the views of tihe
Senaîte. 1 am sure that any me-imorandum
emanating from any member of the Senate,
and submitted. natural]y, by Ris Honeur the
Speaker. will he weico:nd by the Law Officers of the Crown in their examinahion of
the question.
Hon. Mr. FISHER: I am quite willing te
accede te the request of the honourable leader
if he will allow my proposai to go on the
Order Paper as a notice of motion.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is it the amendment of my honourable friend that would go
as a notice of motion?

Hon. Mr. FISHER: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Did I understand the
honourable Minister ta state t:hat the Law
Officers of the Crown had made a report?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No. I do Dot
believe that the Order jn Cauncil, which is
hased upon the recommendation of the Civil
Service Commission. is on its way to the Law
Officers of the Crown at the present moment.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I must have made a
mistake. because I understood during the
recoss that the honoucable Minister stated
that lio had the report of the Law Officers of
the Crown.
Hon. Mr. DANDTJRAND: No; it is the
report of the Civil Service Commission, which
contained certain conditions under which the
position of Black Rod is released, one condition heing that the mnatter cf the appointment be left ta the Law Officers cf the Crown.
Hon. Sic JAMES LOUGHEED: How do
you propose bringing about this eonference?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The matter may
ho somoewhat pressing, because there is a
Supply Bill, voted yesterday, to be assented
ta within the next few days. The appointment will have to be made. Sa I will toniorrow ask the dclk of the Privy Council
to hasten the ýsending of the documents ta
the Law Officers of the Crown, and if it is
the will of the Sonate that I should oeil upon

of the Sonate.

BENGOUGH-WILLOWBUNCH
LINE BILL

BRANCH

CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bihl 74, an
Act respccting the Construction of a line of
railway forming part of the Canadian National
Railways between Bcngough and a point at
or near Willowbunch, in the province of Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. Haydon in the Chair.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANIYURÀND:
gentlemen, perhaps I may be allowed ta cxplain the details. At the second reading it
was understood that I should. give the cxplanation in Committee. This is one of the
three Bills which were rejected last Session
by the Senate. It had corne ta us fromn the
Commons, had been referrel ta aur Railw.ay
Committee and arnended by that Committee.
and had corne back ta this House. I do flot
remember whether we divided on the repart
or on the third reading, but it daes not
inatter.
The Bill had given risc ta considerable
discussion in the district in which the construction of the line was projecteri. Three
alternative schemes had for a long time been
discusscd in the southern part of Saskatchewan,
and the saine division of opinion was carried
on in Parliament. The Canadian Northern
had buit fromn its line running ta Moose Jaw
a branch starting at Radville and proceeding westward towards Bcngough, which
was then the terminus of that branch. There
is considerable mileage bctwecn Bengough
and the American border, and naturally the
people in that region werc maving heaven
and earth to get the location of the railway
as near their home as possible. The branch
line Bill which came ta us from the Comnmons proposed that the line should start at

those who held ta thc opinion that the line
should start at another point on thiat small
branch that rune to Bengough-at a station
nimed Ritchie. There were aiso those who
wanted the branch line continued at Bengough. The Railway Committee of the Senate faît itself una:ble to decide upon the bcst
location and rccommended that this matter
should be left ta the Rail-way Commission.
The Bill was rai ected hy this Blouse.
Now it cornes to us in another form. It is
proposed that a line be huit fromn Bengough
continuing the branch ta Willowbunch, a distance of 27 miles.
The postponement of this matter fa- anc
year has had the result of giving the region

i

two riailways instead of one. The Canadian
Pacifie had 'been building fromn east ta west
and frorn west ta east. They have decided,
through an understanding with the Canadian
National, ta continue their branch line eastward. Therefore the agitation whichi took
place in the district regarding a better service
has been appeased by the fact that the people
there will now have the extension of the
Bengough branch to, Willawbunch and in the
southern part the .C.P.R. extension which
will gradually corne eastward and very likely
connect up with their line which was going
westward.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Would the Minister
state just what specital changes there are
betwcen the Bill as presented last year and
the present proposal?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The map I have
in my hand is flot a large, one. Last year's
Bill had for its abject the building of a line
fromn Radville, or fromn Ritchie, or from
Bcngough, westward, according as the Railway
Commission decided. Our Railway Committee
concludcd that the location should he determincd by the Railway Commission. The Bill
expired in the Senate. Inste.ad of allowing
the Railway Commission ta decide as ta
Radville, Ritchie or Bengough, the present
Bill authorizeq the Canadia.n Nat ional 'ta
extend westward ta Willowbunch its brancb
line which starts at Radville and goes into
Bengough. At the saine tima the Covernment as taken cagnizance of the assurance
by the Canaian Pacific Railway that thcy
will continue eastward the line which they
have started and which is passing between
Eddysîde and Buffalo Gap. Sa this region,
which was to be served partly by a branch ta
start at Bengough and run wes,-twaird, will now
be better served by those two railway companies deviding the tcrritory, the C.P.R.
taking the southern part and the Cn'nadian
National retaining the northe.rn. It hadt been
stated in the Commîttee that there wa,3 mnoney
available in the bank from the proceeds of
bonds issued 'by the Canadian Northern, with
the guarantee of the Province, ta biiild that
line. That financial aspect, or that contribution of the Canadian Northern, wiceh is naw
the Canadian National, did nat appear in
the text of the Bill.

No, there is no

Does that
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
absorb ahl the monies under thc Acts of the
Provincial Government?
Everything exHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
cept this $1,200,000.
Hon. Sic JAMES LOUGHEED: 1 shouid
like to make some observations touching boti
thes-e Bis. Someone lias very properly said
that the duty of the Senate ie- to check hasty
legislation. I cannot recaîl any subject which
so well vîndicates the action of the Senate
as the situation we find to-dýay. Last session
there came down from the House of Commons
two Bis, one making provision for thc construction of 115 miles of road at a cost of
$3,706,000, and thc other making provision for
the building of 102 miles at a cost of $2,313,000. When those Bills came from tic House
of Commons no provision was made as to tic
contribution of a subsidy from the Provincial
Government or fromn any other source. When
the matter was up for discussion in Committee,
I tbink some officer of the Provincial GovernmentHon. Mc. DANDURAND: The Minister of
Agriculture.
Hon. Sic JAMES LOUGHEED: --did make
some reference to a possible subsidy; but there
was nothing contained within the four corners
of the Bill touching that subi ect.
Now we have practically the samne two railWhat was
ronds before us on this occasion.
known as the ftadville Bill contemplated a
road of 115 miles in length, and costing $3,706,000. That has now been rcduced to 27 miles
and the cost is te be $545,000 instead of $3,706,
In other words we have escaped build000.
ing 88 miles of railroad and apparcntly that
section of the country is perfectly well satisfied
iviti the arrangement contained in this Bill.
'of
When I say the cost will be $545,000 1,
course, take into consideration the subsidies
which will be paid over by the Provincial
Government, amounting to 8400,000. That is
to say, the total cost of the 27 miles will be
$945,000, 340,000 of which will be paid by
the Province, lcaving an expendtiture of $545,000 to be met by the National Systcm.
Coming to tie Turtleford- branci, the Bill
which came from the Commons last year
made provision for the building of 102 miles
at a cost of $2,313,000. Tiat is now reduced
In this
to 67 miles, at a. cost of $1,871,000.
way we escape building 35 miles of railroad,
and we secure from the Provincial Government a subsidy of $801,000 making the net
cost to the National System $1,070,000.
The sumnation of 'the whoie transaction is
this: Provision was miade in the two Bills of
last session to expend 36,019,000 upon the

b

construction of 220 miles of road; we are now
satisfying the public by this legisiation w'ith
an expenditure of $1,615,,000 instead of $6,01,9.000, thus effecting .a saving to the country
of $4,404,000.
My honourable friend did indicate last
year that this subsidy was held by the Provincial Governmient; but it must bie recalled
that Parliament had no information upon that
subject, and that the Bis made no provision
for the contribution of that subsidy. How,
it would have been applied afterwards, if
applied at ail, one of course cannot say. The
only information we had was contained in
the Bis las they came from the Comimons.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Anyway, there was
oniy $1,200,000.
Hon. 'Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes. I
simply direct the attention of the Oha.mber
to Vhis fact in vindication of the course which
we pur.sucd Iast session. I think it will stand
to the credit of the Senate of Canada that
we exercised prudence and caution in rejeeting that legisiation.
In the flrst place, last session there was a
very marked division of opinion, particularly
as to the Radford road, the parties t'hemnselves
aýpparently not being able to agree upon how
the road should be built. Three alternative
schemes were sugge.sted, and finally the
axrbitiament, so to speak, of the question was
to lie lef t to the Railvay 'Commission. As
to the Turtieford Brandi it can scarcely be
said that 'there was ýthe samne division of opinion; but nevcrtheiess there was no unanimity
upon it. To-day, however, we apparentiy
have both sections of the country thoroughly
satisficd, and, as 1 -have saiýd, we have saved
to the country S4,404,000.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In justification
of the 'Canadian Na:tional Railways I wiil
simpiy draw attention to the fact that this
31,200,000 was Canadian Nort'hern money,
which means Canadian National money. It
waz from bonds upon which it had to pay
interest, so that money would have flowed
into thc treasury of the Canadian National
at a given moment.
Hon. Sic JAMES LOUGREED: Lt is hard
to say what would. have been donc with it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not intend
to recriminate over the ac~tion of the Senate
last year. I simply draw attention to the
fact that the Railwtay Comimission could,
perhaps, have brouglit about the agreement
which lias heen corne to by the two railways.
Lt was for the Raîlway Commission to decide
whcre the road was to go; possibly it would

SENATE

have named Bengough, and then we wourld
have had a shorter route to finance. At the
same time. I am quite satisfied that except
for the loss of time-and I am not sure that
there was any loss of time-the district will
be well served by the two railways.
As to the Turtleford line, which will come
next, of course for the moment we are saving
money because we are not building as far
as we would have last year. It will be for
the Senate to decide when it will be judicious for the Canadian National Railways to
take the next step.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUCHEED: So far as
the loss of time is concerned, I have yet to
learn that the Canadian National Railways
have made any marked progress with the
building of the lines we passed last session.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Unfortunately
the Senate sat until nearly the end of July,
and they lost the season.

TURTLEFORD BRANCH LINE BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 69, an
Act respecting the Construction of a line of
railway forming part of the Canadian National
Railways between Turtleford and a point in
Township 48, Range 12, West ci the Third
Meridian, in the province of Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. Haydon in the Chair.
Hon.

Mr.

DANlDURAND.

On section 1-power to construct and complete line described in schedule:
Hon. Mr. GORDON:
What is the estimated revenue on this proposed road?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We heard from
the officers and engineers of the Company
last year. They satisfied us that the territory
was good territory. which was already settled,
and that that branch line, like most of the
branch lines in that region, would support
itself. I do not sec the honourable gentleman
from Moose Jaw here. I think if he were
present he would suport my statement.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: But since that time
we have perhaps been enlightened as to the
revenues of the road out there, and I was
wondering if the opinion of the officers of the
National Railways as given last year would
tally with what they think at present on the
subject. We have it from the head of the
National System that last year the Systemn
lost on the transportation of grain over
$5.000,000, notwithstanding the fact that my
honourable friend from Saskatchewan has so
often told us that that is tfe paying end of
the road. In view of this very large loss
of the National Road on the transportation
of grain. and of the possibility that more is
known about the matter now than was known
last year, I wonder if some of these branches
sbould be built. I wonder if tlhis one really
should.
The memoHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
randum which I have in my hand reads as
follows:

It is proposed in 1925 te caIl for tenders for the
girling of 44 miles, stipulating that 20 miles would be
completed during the season of 1925 and the balance in
the next year; to lay 30 miles of track during 1925
al a cost of $755,000 in the year 1925. In 1926 grading
wouiil be completed, and it proposed to lay the track
and ballast the same and generally complete the line
to Mile 67.
The 23 miles of grading now completed was started
in 1920 and completed in 1921. Beyond this, no other
woik has been done on the line.
This 67 miles is part of the Trutleford-Hafford line
as submitted and passed by the Iouse of Commons on
27th June, 1923, and 16th May, 1924, and in both cases
thrown out by the Senate.
The district through which the line runs is generally
rolling, with timber in places of small sized poplar in
bluffs with prairie openings. It is largely a mixed

is susceptible te wbeat raising. The land la mostly

The justification fer this line la t-hat there la a large
nucober ni settlers in its vicinity new such, a distance
frein railway facilites that the road haul on their
pioduets is se excessive that it la almoat prohibitive.
It is estimated tbat this lins will preduce on an
average 1,400,000 bushels of grain eaob year, besides .500
carý of fce'abt in and eutbound, consisting of live stock,
rosI, lumber and marchandise. About 82 miles on the
average would be saved tbe farmers in their road. haul
on tIhe 1.400,000 bushels et grain, which it la expected
tbs district will preduce annually, and if this la taken
as being wortb J cent par bushel per mile bauled, it
would ruake an annual saving nf 8838,000 to tham for

8207,200 ou the rigbt ef way and grade, wbicb la earnxng netbing. The business ebtained f rom this lins will

cause it was found that those monies were
for the building of certain named branch lines,
and could not be used for other purposes until
the Saskatchewan Legisiature .passed legislation permitting the monies to be used for the
iconstruction of branch limes in the Province
o0ther than the epecific lines mentioned in the
original Bills which authorized the sale of the
bonds. Therefore I thinlc it would be leaving
:a mistaken impression to say that the money
would have been avail&,ble and would have
been used for the construction of those limes
bcd the Bills of Iast year passed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will state the
facts. I *do flot know whether my honourable
friend was in the Chamber whenHon. Mr. ROBERTSON. Yes.
-I
read a
Hon. 'Mr. DANDURAND:
letter from Mr. Ruel explaining that in March
of last year the Legisiature, which was in
session, passed a Bill apportioningithe balance
of the money which shou'ld go to the various
branch lines. But included in that Bill was a
clause allowing an alteration or a transfer Df
the money from one branch to another. The
Radville brancb was on that list. The Turtle-lord branch was not on the list, but in virtue
of the powers contained in the Act, the Canadian National Railways intended asking that
a certain portion should go to that line.
What occurred in the discussion to which
my honourable friend refers was in answer to
the accusation that the Senate had blocked
the building of that line. The statement was
ma.de that there wag enough money, $1,200,000, to build that lUne, and that the ýCanadian
National Railways did not need to await the
further action of the Parliament of Canada.
My honourable friend will remember that it
could utilize that money. I remember the
incident very well, hecause I applied to, the
iRaîlway Departinent to know why, if the
amount was there, it should not be used in
order to, build that branch, because it was in
~that section that the noise was made. It was
-represented to me that that amount fell short
of what was required by some 834,000 or
'$54,000, and that the Canadian National Railways had no right to start building, even
with that money which was in the treasury,
because it would have to use a certain amount
which had mot only not been authorized by
Parliament, but refuseà by Parliament, so the

excitement in that region has been appeased
by the agreement that has been come to between the Canadlian Pacifie Railway and the

they will have two railways instead of one.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Were those bonds

statement. The maney is in the bank.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Yes, but how long
has it been there?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, for a number of years. But the bank has agreed to
give a littie more interest on the money that
it has than is needed to pay the interest on
the bonds, so that although the money has
béen there it has not been idle; it has earned
interest-a littie more than was necessary to
meet the interest on the bonds.

tended to give specific power to control the
quantity or weight of ýproducts in these cans
or containers, as such specific power was not
previously given, and this had led to some

JUNE 5, 1925
confusion and possibly some unfairness in
the past.
Hon. L. MeMEANS: I wou'ld like to ask
the honourable gentl<eman a question:
I
do not know that it is relative to the issue.
Ia this proposai going to involve this country
in any more expense for the administration
of the Department of Agriculture?
Last
year there was submitted to the House of
Commons-I think, frein the Deputy Minister of Agriculture-and passed by the Senate,
a Bill which hias cost this country a great
deai of money without producing any result.
I ref or te, the Act respecting the grading of
eggs.
I see by a report made in anether
place that last year $200,000 of the money
of this country was spent in cenuection with
the grading of eggs, and, se far as I can gather,
it lias been the subject of a great deai of
trouble arnong retail dealers. In the old days
the Canadian hien was doing business in the
saine old style and nobody bothered about
hier.
To-day, if a grocer sefls a dozen of
eggs, hie must have them graded firat, second,
or third grade. Farmers or market gardeniers
in somte of the outiying districts of Winnipeg
hrought eggs into the city and soid them. ini
the usual way to storekeepers, who retailed
them to customers.
What çma the resuIt?
You have a hordle of officiais up there--I think
there are about 22 officiaIs in one office--to look
after the Ganadian hieu, and those retailers
were brouglit into court and fined for carryîng
on the sale of eggs in the usual way.
0f
what benefit has it been to this country to
spend last year over $200,000 of the people's
money on the grading of eggs and to throw
upon egg producers and dealers a great deai
cf responsibillty and trouble?
Furthermore,
this legisiation lias raised the price cf eggs
te the consumer. Re is charged three or four
cents more a dozen because the eggs have
had to be graded.
Hon. Mr. PLANTA: They are no better,
either.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: They are ne better.
Why does the Government keep adding year
after year te the horde of officiais living upon
the people, when the people are groaning
under the burden cf taxation to-day? If in
a similar way you go on introducing Acts
creatîng new departments, yau will have
deputy ministers, officiais, and clerks ranging
alI the way from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
What good is it dcing?
I took ýoccasion here a short time ago to
mention an incident that occurred in the city
cf Winnipeg. Fromn a certain pork butcher
there the Governments themseN~es had bought
cured meat to be sent to the city of Chicago
S-25,

387

and exhibited as the finest cured bacon that
could loossibly bo found anywhére in America.
Yet that man was not allowed te ighip cured
bacon out-ide of Manitoba. Al'hough bath
the Dominion Governiment and the Provincial
Government had bought this bacon and put it
on exhibition te show its excellent quality, and
although everything about the qnan's piace
was in good order, hie fouud that if hie seld a
pound cf that bacon in the province of Saskatchewan or anywhere outside cf the province cf Manitoba, hie would have the Departmont cf Agriculture jumping on him and
threatening him wi' h prosecution.. If I wanted
te have some cf that 'bacon on my own breakfast table I couid net, bocause it couid not
he brought dlown here. I think that in oe
or two cases they confiscated some cf his
produc'.
Whiie I arn on my feet I want te say
that it i-s hîgh time that the people cf Canada
were giveu seme relief from this burden cf
what I may eall fatherly protection. People
are required te grade eggs, and they must do
this, that and the other thing, while a horde
of officiais are living upen the public. There
ought te be some remedy or somne stop te it.
lion. Mr. DANDUliAND:
Honourabie
gentlemen, there may be considerable trulli in
the statement cf my honourabie friend from
Manitoba, but the blame, if there be any,
stiil rests on our shoulders as weli as on others.
We passed the legislation. I have now in my
hand some uroposed ameudments te it. Lately
we referred to the Senate Committee on Agriculture a Bill coming from, the Agriculture
Departmen.t. This oe is from the saine Departmoont, and I have ne objeaction whatever
te having it referred, after it passes the
second reading, te the Committee on Agriculture, with one or two other Buis that I have. In
the Commit-tee we cau hear the Dapartmental
officials and dbtain direct information from
them. We can ask them for a statement regarding the organîzation cf thair inspectorship,
with a 'view te determinîng whether or net
the inspectera are toc numerous and should be
reduced in number by giving oe inspecter
the right te examine three or four differaut
kinds cf produets. Parba4pa the inspection requiresg special knowledge. I de net know. If
it is thought advisabie for us te refer this
measure te the Com.mittee on Agriculture, my
honourable friend will have an eppertunity te
meet the representatives cf the Departient
cf Agriculture and have a heart-to-heart talk
with thamn as te t.he necessity for this inspection.
As te the usefulness cf the work, I -cannet
in a haphazard way give an opinion. It is al

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

Standing Committee on Agricffltýre.

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I desire to point out
to the honourable gentleman the fact, of whiých
he must be perfectly well aware, that before

Hon. Mr.
bey said.

SCHAFFN1-ER:

That is what

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
That is what they
said. I think my honourable friend will agree
that the country is being run by the officiais,
for the Ministers are in office for only a short
time. The Deputy Ministers admitted before :he Committee that the more officiais
thev have in their Denartments the more
important thcy considered them, aod consequprntly the greater salary they should receive.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My haonourable friend should not generalize to that
extent.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
This is the statement that was made. Though we know that
the cost of the governiment of the country
is going up by leaps and bounds, there is no
retrenchment.
We have spoken time and
again in this bouse in protest; we have
pointed to other couintries, particulanly ta
Great Britain, where the public expenditure
has heen reduced; yet the numher of officiais
of this country is being continually increased,
unnecesarily, and the cost to the country
continually augmented.

Hon. Mi\1.DANDURAND: I do not sec that

it is an omnibus Bill. There are three or
four amiendments. I would say that we shaîl
not he bound by the pasýing of the second
reading, but rsimply scnd the Bill ta the Committee on Agriculture. where my hoýnourable
friend cao he heard dn the presence of the
experts, and when the Bill coine oiît of Coinmittee, we may take the opinion of the
Senate on thie principle, if there be anc.

Hon. Mr. MeLEAN:
The rason I sent
over to the leader of the Government a
sampie of canned fish was that it is crayffish,
put up by a firm in New Jersey. The fish are
caught in British Honduras. W/bat I would
like to know is whether it is legal to allow
that produet to enter Canada, as lobster. It
is not, lobster, yet it is coming into Canada
as such.

Hon. Mr. SMITH: 1 recognize that there
ino special principle that pertains to, this
Bill, but there is a principle involved in thec
introduction of this and the previaus Bill,
especialiy the one that bas just passed its
second rcadinýg. which I should like to discuss.
Bis are brought into this House with general
provxosons, gîving Departments powcr to make
very drastic regulations. That practice lias
heen growing for miany ycars. I can remernber
that vears ago, when such Bis were brought
in, the proposed regulations were printed in
the Bill, sa that the members of the House
were able to discuss them. Th-at practice bas
aitoget'her ceased, and Bis are now brought
in from year to year providing that the Gox ernment may. make ail the regulations. From
uny experience in the hast twa years I havc
no objection to the regulations that have
been made, 'for 1 have a1ways found that
the officiais of the Department wiýth which

that alter suclu consultation, 'ýZuey passed

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

I have had to deal were courteous, that they

regulations that were agreeabie to them.
Some day, however, we may not have departmental officiais who wili do this, but they
may be autocratie and pass regulations that
wili flot be agreeabie to those engaged in
the industry. I want to provide against that
contingency.
I know the reason for the present practice:
it is to enab'e the officiais to get these Bis
through easiiy. If regulations are printed in
the Bill, n:aturaiiy considerable discussion in
bath Houses foilows, and the Ministers, not
qperhaps being possessed of full knowiedge of
the details, would find difficulty in getting
euch Bis through. It is much easier to get
a biank Bill through, and let the Department
make the regulations.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Woud, there
flot be another reason: the fact that the Department feels, from experience, that it may
need to -amend the regulations from tirne ta
time?
Hon. Mr. SMITH: There is nothing to
prevent them from amending the regulations
in the foilowing year. I ar n ot objecting
ta this Bill, provided that those engaged in
the industry wiii be consuited. It seems to
me that it is the duty of the Governmnent,
in making regulations, to consuit those interested. In order to provide for that, I give
notice that when the Bill goes ta. Committee
I wiil move that the foilowing words be inserted ini paragraph a of subsection 3 of section 2:
After con'ýutation with and advice of the Horticultural Society of Canada.

This Bill bas to do with the regul-ations
reg-arding fruit. Now, we have an institution
)caiied the Horticuiturai Council of Canada,
which was organized twa or three years ago.
It is supported in some measure by the Government, and su.stained by heavy subscriptions from various industries affiliated with
the fruit-growers. This council was originaiiy
an organization of fruit-growers, who are
recognized as having rnany matters in common with other members of the Council,
and the industries comprise canned goods,
j am, nurseries, seeds, who]esaie fruit handling,
etc. AI!. these industries have representatives on the board of the Horticulturai Council, and my resolution provides that before
any legisiation is introduced it shall be subinitted to that Council.

4ot corne into force until 60 days after its
ienactment. At present it is provided that
.it shall corne into force îmmediateiy after it
is passed, which wouid afford no opportunity
for anybody to make representations to the
Government. Even after the Hostîcuitural
Council and the officials of the Government
have passed upon the Bill, there may be
thousands of peopie in Canada who may ob,ject ta it, yet who have not been heard. I
do not see any nccessity for the Bill coming
into force immediateiy. We h;vye been doing
without it for a hundired years, and I simpiy
provide for a period of 60 days.

READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND maved tihe second
reading af Bill 151, an Act ta amend the Northwest Territories Act.
He said: The Northwest Territories Act,
chapter 62 of the Revised Statutes of Canada.
1906, is amended by adding the foliowing paragraph after paragra'ph p of subsection 1 of
section 8:
(q) The issuing of licenses or permnits to scientists or
explorers who wish to enter the said Territories and
the prescribing of the conditions under whIih ouah
licenses or perinits xnay be granted in each case, anti

work is ýcarried on by foreigners it should 'be
donc not only with the knowledge of this
Government, but with its consent and written
permission. This measure is introduced for
the purpose of making it com.pulsory for
foreign scientists and explorers to secure the
necessary permission bof ore entering the Northwest Territories.
I confess ühat to me this is an absolutely
new feature in the treatment of foreign scientists. I invite the attention of the memibers
of the Senatet to the principle contained in
it, if there be any principle, so that we may
take it up next weck and discuss it in Committee.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I wish to say that this
is a very common thing in other countries, and
1 think we need legisiation of this kind. For
instance, in Greece and ýail other easteru countries there are strict regulations on soientists
who go thore to make discoveries. They are
flot allowod to take out of the country what
they discovor. We have in Alberta a great
collection of dinoýsaurs and other remains of
that kind, and I think that the people ought
to be a1loxved to keep them at home if they
wish to, and not allow foreigners to take them.
I think this legisiation is quite in order.
I do not intend
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
to o'bstruct my own Bill, but I simply state
that it is a departure, as far as I have seen
't.

THJE RAILWAY SITUATION IN CANADA
INQUIRY

Hon. J. A. MeDONALD rose in accordance
with the following notice:
Tèat he will call the attention of the Government
to the rallway situation throughout Canada at the
present time, end will enquire what action the Governnient is taking to decrease the cost of adminrnatton.

He said: Honouraible gentlemen, there are
three things which are disturbing the public
mind -in Canada to-day: the railway situation,
taxation, and une.rplayment. I go to the
othar House and I sea thare hour after hour
given to trivial discussions; I see six weeks
spent in discussing the Budget; but I have
neyer seen any real, progressive attempt made
to bring these matters thoroughly and frankly
before the people of Canada. Before the
end of the Session I hope to give my views
on these three important subi ecta. To-night
I intend ta deal briefly with the railway
situation and to give my ideas along a constructive line.
There is a sinall percenitage ai the people
of Canada interested in the pay'ment of incorne taxes-a few here and a few there
throughout the country, perhaps even a few
of the honourable gentlemen wit&hin xny hearing at the moment. Then, there is a amnaIl
percentage of the people of Canada, perhaps
even a smaller percentage than those of the
income tax class, who are interested in the

ao-called foreign relations of Canada. Some
of the most distinguished of these are members of this Hue. There is another section
of the public of Canada who show some interest in tariff matters; somte of tihese are
here to-day; and with this section I must
admit a kinslhip and fellow-féeling that stirs
me to no great sympathy with some of the
racant lagisiation, along thase lines. But al
these sections of the people of C!anada corne
together on a -comm-on ground of sympathy,
if flot of undersîtanding, when we reach out
and lay hold upon Canada's railway prohlem.
This, ta our undarstanding citizenship, is
Canada's great cloud. It hangs over the future
of our country, deprassing those who give it
thought and frightening the would-Ibe investor
in the ýcountry's future.
The man who knows that in the last five
yaars this country of nine millions of people,
with a national diebt of two and a half
billions of dollars, has furliher invested by
cash advances, capital, and bond issues, the
enormo.us sumn of $585,848,974 in our national
railway, not including interest-I say that the
man who realizas that f act and passes it over
wit~h merely a gasture of optimism, is not
a citizen friand, but a citizen fool.
I arn not a railway man, but there have
been instances of the inexpert showîng the
way to the specialist, of the novice givîng the
exneriencad nian the very suggestions he has
needed. In this spirit, honourable gentlemen.
I humbly suggest a method which I thînk
merits the consideration of my honourable
friendis preserit, the Governxment of tihe day,
especially the Minister directing the Department of Railways, and, the experienced executives at present directing our railways, as
well as the people from one end of the
country to the other, w'ho may not give thair
attention without benefit.
I bahieva that, second only to our present
condition of over-expansion in railways, our
greatest mistake is over-centralization of
these nationally-owned railroads.
Centralization of aut'hority in wartime may
ha nacessary; indeed, I believe it to be
necassary, provided the riglit directing
genius is available; but surely a state of war
is not a natural condition. I shall not likely
meet opposition ta that statement, but I
would stress the point a moment. A country
at war means a people entirely banded tagether ta meet a common enemy, and euccess
or failure means life or death. That seems
ta be the situation we are in to-day in
meeting our railway difficulties. At lest,
we see ahead af us financial bankruptcy, or,
provided we ca-n work out of these difficul-

392

SENATE

ties, economie salvation. But who will affirm
that the people of a country at peace are
moved by the same subserviency to authority
or stirred to the same degree of blind effort
and sacrifice, as when at war? Centralization
of control in the operation of our national
railways cannot succeed unless the citizens
resident in the different sections of the
Dominion. with widely divergent interests, are
willing to pool their interests for advantages
chiefly beneficial to one or two localities
rather than to all. I say that it is not
possible to obtain an executive who, by
spending a portion of his time in the United
States or across the water, a little more of
his time in the city of Montreal, and an
occasional excursion to the outlying parts
of our Dominion. can operate an organization of such diverse service and interest as is in his hands.
I have the
greatest respect for the Chairman of our
National railways. I acknowledge him to be
a great railway man. and, further, I have a
regard for the capacity of some of his assistants; but these men are net super-men. They
are naturallv inclined to build up an organization that will lighten their own tasks.
They will be inclined to make ruiles and
define regulations that their subordinates in
distant sections of the country dare not
deviate from.
What railway employee is
there in either British Columbia or Nova
Scotia-and in referring to these I refer to
all the provinces-who will undertake to
defy this centralized authority, even though
he is aware that the best interests of that
part where he resides will be served by such
defiance?
I have had some experience in
this matter of which I am speaking, and I
say that net only could the head man in that
section of the country not accede, in this instance of which I speak, to local conditions
and requirements. but ho could not succeed
in having the central executive understand
his viewpoint. The matter had to be taken
un personally with the central power by persons outside the railway employ, and for a
time this authorit v
was even too busy to hear
and understand the problem presented. Surely, honourable gentlemen, if I know of this
and several other instances of the kind, they
could be multiplied in number from coast
to coast, and many of them are neglected
and never receive their proper consideration.
Now, I have said that centralized authority
tends to over-systematizing an organization,
which precludes the possibility of giving to
each part its proper measure of understanding
and the sympathetie treatment of its needs.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD.

Ontario and Quebec have their own problems, but these should net be solved to the
neglect of matters of moment and concern
to other provinces. The Maritimes have their
problems, the Middle West theirs, and the Far
West theirs also-all of a different nature, but
of equal importance in the building up and
progress of our Dominion.
I will now pass to a brief discussion of some
details of my proposal.
The Maritime Provinces have always protested against the absorption of the old Intercolonial ento the National system. They
have more than purely eceonomic reasons for
their protests; but these political reasons are
weil known to you and to the people of the
country as a whole; I will not stress them here.
I wculd propose that we revert to the old
order of things and place again the Atlantic
Division of the present great system in the
hands of men who know the local condition
and local requirements.
I would do the
same thing for the Provinces of Quebec and
Ontario and the western sections of the
countr. a the interest of each may be determined by its geography.
I would place in charge of each division or
district a Manager directly responsible to the
Minister of Railways at Ottawa.
It may
he said, that this would be centralizing
authority over again, but this need not be
so.
Each Manager would have the same
power that is now placed in the hands of one
active or>erating head, and should have the
sole right to appoint his heads in charge
of the various departments.
The Division headquarters should be located
as may be mot convenient.
The Directing
Manager should be completely in control of
his Division and reporting, as I have said, only
to the Minister of Railways.
I would have
this Directing Manager devote his entire time
and abilities to the interests of the railway
in the Division which he controls.
If in this arrangement it were found advisable to establish an advisory board to the
Minister of Railways this could verv easily
be donc by a regular meeting of all Directing
Managers for purposes of needed co-operation
and co-ordination.
The Minister of Railways
would very naturally be Chairman of this
Board, and his deputy Vice-Chairman.
I have perhaps not sufficiently enlarged upon
the duties of the Directing Managers. They
would of course require to be men of large
expe"ience, broad vision. capacity for hard
work. and thorough integrity-men who are
not only capable of studying the needs and
aspirations of the people of each Division, but
courageous enough to say "No" when necessary.
They should constitute a buffer be-

JUNE 8. 1925
tween self-seeking people and the Minister
of Railways, and work out their diifilculties
in, Cabinet fashion, thus making the advisory
or control board a court of last appeal.
It may be thoughi- that a grave difficulty
presents itsel'f in cecuring men of the required
qualifications te f111the positions of Directing
Managers. I ar n ot one who will agree to
this, for I believe that we bave in Canada
a large number of experienced business men
witb 'he requisite energy, and possessed of
integrity unsurpassed by any other people
in any section of the world.
Now, honourable gentlemen, when we have
organiized along these lines we have got a
sound business arrangement. We will have
satisfled the various sectional requirements
and created an o>pportuniýy for business rivalry
andi commercial cornpetency that cannot but
be of great value in working away froro our
present difficulties, and we will be following
iii the direction that other great business en,erpri-es have taken.
Io the commercial world wc bave seen in
the .past twent.y years an unscramblesi corporation making giant strides in the accumulation of great wealth. I refer to the great
Standard Oul Company, which twenty years
ago or less was eut into pieces, according to
the States in which it operated. If I remerober correctly, this unscrambling process was
the direct resulit of a fear in the mind of the
American people that in centralized control. of
oil there was being developed a dangerous
commercial octopuýs. 1 recaîl a newspaper
story of that time which told us bow John
D. Rockefeller receivesi the court announcement autborizing the unscrambling of bis great
eompany. Hie was playing golf when the
telegraro was given to biro. Hie was just
about te make a drive. Hie read it, smilesi
and made a perfect shot. Now, time bas
proven that John D. Rockefeller's smile was
of the knowing kind. Hie bas said since then
that the wurld is moving too miioh toward centralization in its commercial organization.
Tirne bsas proven that the breaking up of the
,9 andard 011 Company into oumerous smal
companies was a good thing for Standard Oil
investmeots. it bas, developed a rivalry between one section and another. It bas enablesi the controliling heads in the various
sections to understand bettter the needs of
those to whom they seIl, and it bas permitted
them to, go ahead and supply those needs without having to consider condi ions in Kalamazco or New Mexico.
We turo to, a different type of centralization,
but one that we are aIl familiar with, and
*which perhaps possesses more analogous points

393

than oýur Canadian railways situation. 1 refer
Io the political organization of our Empire.
Is there one honourable gentleman here today who would support in the smallest degree
a centralization of the control of this great
Empire? Each conmponent part has its own
interes s; each commonwealth in thiis Imperial
Realro must work out its own salvation fcr
itself. True, there is an Imperial Conference
which meets oc.easionally in London, and
which. so far as 1 arn aware, has done no
great barma; but it was not always so. The
domination and interference of Downing Street
a hundred years ago and less was a matter of
grave concern and-might I add?-of scme
disgust. I read my history aright, centralized
control of the Bri'tish Empire was a curse and
not n blessing so far as Canada was concerned,
and to the decentraldzation of authority must
be a'tributed the Empire's solidarity and succeso to-day.
I believe that our National railways need
the same procedure in treatment Ps was administered to Standard Ou,. and the breaking
up of control--control that bas been f ound sc
vuluable in Ibuild ing un our Empire~ in prosperity and unbreakable bonds of affection.
1 woiuld diivide the railway' into sections,
one froro Fort William west., one froro Montreal t(> Fort Williamn, and one frora 'Montreal
to lali-fax. 1 arn goinig to, spe.ak about the
Maritime Provinces t-o-ndight. I know that a
high morale is rrecesmsry to the success of the
railway. In the old days when the Intercolonial was operatedi by our own men, in. the
way that 1 have out'iined, not only was it not
losing rooney, but it was ýmaking rooney;
wbereas to-day 1 amn told that there was a
ioss of about $5,000,000 last year.
To give you a prgati:caf illustration of the
effect of one man in Montesl being -in control, 1 wiUl take an instance in my -own experience, a few days ago. I went West to
solirit business for -one of the large imanufacturing industries in the Maritime Provinces,
andi 1 got it. I came back to the Maritimes,
and cadliýg on the bead of the mailways there,
toild iro the purchasers of my instruments
were a littfle afratid. that I would not be able
to get it to thero as quirkly as if they bougbt
it in the Province of Onterio. I said: "Will
you keep a fotl4ow iup ceck eaoh day of
where my instruments are so that I can report?" H1e said: "Oh, no. we haven't got
time te do that, if you take the ma-tter up
with Montireril they nbay be able to do it." I
went to another systero of railways, anid in five
minutes tbey had my business.
1 wilI give you amother inotance. A qarge
radiio station was buil-t by the railway in

394

SENATE

Moncton, and they had to have an instrument there to openate with. I a.pproaehed
them and asked to be allowed to bid, but they
sa-id, "Your instrument is not good enough."
This happened in spite of the fact that Sir
Henry Thorniton had said-and I think he
meant it-that, Maritime interests should .receive consideration. And after two months of
running back and forth to Montreal I was
all.owed to place my piano in competition,
and I won. Then, I know of certain cases in
which there have been hundreds of oars on
sidinigs in Ontario, while mills in the Maritime Provinces we-re closed down and mines
closed because they could not get cars. If
our own peoiple where operating the roa.d,
they would come to my miiH or to my factory
to solicit trade. and there woiuld be competition between the diifferent sections, and eompetition would stir up business and breed men
to look after it.
By the plan I have suggested every man
who las business with or for the railways
whether he is in the East or the West, will
have a chance to approa,ch the au'thority in
his own locality, and have an answer, yes or
no, and not the reply: "We have not time to
deal wi'th this matter," or. "You wili liave to
take this to somebody else."
There is another ma:ter to which I would
like to refer. I hold in my hand a book published by and sent out "with the compliments
of the Canadian National Railways, Grand
Trunk System," outlining a route through
Canada. I want to ernphasize the fact that
the route runs from Sarnia to London, from
London to Haimlton, from Hamiliton to Niatara Falls, frein Niagara Falls to Toronto,
from Toronto to Montreal and Qucbec, and
from Mont-real to Portland. There is not a
mention of the Maritime Provinces; not a
word about the winter port at St. John.
nothing about Prince Edward Island, "the
garden of the Gulf of St. Lawrence." or the
famous Bras d'Or Lakes in Cape Breton, or
the Land of Evangeline; not a mention of
Matapediýa. or the Baie des Chaleurs, or the
St. John River in New Brunswilck-the Hudson of Canada-or Halifax Harbour with its
Bedford Basin and Northwest Arm.
Even
Moncton, the hub of the Maritimes, is not
mentioned. Portiland is the whole thingwhy? The nigger is in the wood-pdle; smoke
him out.
I hope I have not talked too much, but I
believe I am paid to come here and give the
best thought I can to these problems. If I
have not solved them, I have donc the best I
possibly could. I have laid before this House
my solution of our present deadly railway
puzzle.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, if no other member wants to
address the House on this inquiry of my
honourable friend, I will state that it will
be my duty to draw the attention of the
President of the Canadian National Railways
to the remarks of my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second

He said: This Bill contains amendments
to the Supreme Court Act which bear on
dates of sessions of the Court, appeals from
court of last resort, leave to appeal by provincial court of last resort, procedure in
appeals. and notice of intention to limit appeals.
These amendments are suggested by the

was read the second time.
DAIRY INDUSTRY BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 109, an Act to amend the
Dairy Act, 1914.
He said: Honourable gentlemen. this is a
Bill which can be explained much better in
Committee, because it covers a number of
armendments which are proposed to the Dairy
Industry Act, and which are intended to
render that Act more comprehensive, eliminating weaknesses that have become apparent
during the administration of the Act in the
past five years, and to provide teavier penalties for infractions.
I intend, if we take the second reading, to
refer the Bil.1 to the Committee on Agriculture.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Of course,
that will not exclude the Bill being considered
by Committee of the Whole upon its return
from the Select Committee.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It will not
exclude the right to refer the Bill to Committee of the Whole House if any member
deems it judicious to do so.

JUNE 8, 1925
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I doubt
the propriety of sending a public Bill of this
character to a Select ýCommittee, particulariy
a very small Committee, and then overlooking
the more important step which awaits every
public measure, of bringing it before the Commnittee of the Whole. Therefore I hope that
when the report from the Select or Standing
Committee cornes in, my honourable friend
will have the BiI referred ta the Committee
of the Whole.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I believe my
honourable friend is right in making that
suggestion. I recognize that the Committee
on Agriculture is smail in number though
weighty in quality; and I wouid urge the
members who are interested in these Bis to
appear before t-hat Committee in order that
they may suggest amendments. They can do
sa there, and express their views.
Whiie on that subi cct I would like ta remind
honourable members of the Senate of the fact
that we have two or three speciai Committees to which have been referred important Buis, and I would suggest that they treat
those Committees with as much concern and
interest as the work of the House itself. I
hope that ail those Committees will be fully
manned when the Bills corne before them.
The motion was agreed, ta, and the Bill
was- read the second time, and referred ta
the Select Standing Committee on Agriculture and Forestry.
LIVE STOCK AND LIVE STOCK
PRODUCTS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANI)URAND moved the second
reading of Bill 111, an Adt ta amend the
Live Stock and Live Stock Produets Act,
19M~.
Honourabie gentlemen, it is
He said:
souicht to amend the Live Stock and Live
Stock Products Art in two or three particulars. Subsection 2 of section 4 is to be
amnended to provide that moneys received hy
commission merchants for the purchase of
stonck and money received from stock sales
shahl be placed in a shippers' trust account.
Section 5 of the Act is ta be repeaied, and
the ncw section is ta provide for licensrng,
if considered nccssary, those who operate as
exporters oif live stock, meat, pouitry, eggs,
and wool. Another section provides for the
prohibition from sale of eggs unfit for human
consumption.
This is one of the Bills th-at should go to
the Comcnittee on Agriculture.
Hon. Mr. Mo-MEANIS: Can the honourable gentleman inform the bouse as ta what

expense is involved in the amendiment of
these Bis? I am, a littie critical on these
matters, because during the few years I -have
sat in t-his House 1 have noticed that when
these amendments go ino aperatian there are
a great many officiais emipioyed to put them
into effect, and a great deal of expense in this
way is put on the country, without bringing in
any return so far as I can see. I think I
wou1 d 'be justified in asking the honourabie
leader of the Government, when he moves
the second, reading of such Bis, to state
whether they invoive extra expense in enforcement, hv the appointment of additionai cmployees in the Civil Service.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I wouid venture
to affirma that there wiii be no extra expenditure in the case of most of these amendments, because the inspectorshi-p must be fairiy
complete, as these Acts are now on the
Statute Book and are being operated. But this
is speciai information whieh honourabie gentlemen and the members of the Committee
on Agriculture will get when Vhey have the
Deputy Ministers and the experts from the
Department of Agriculture before them. It
has been said that there are inspectors al
over the land for ail sorts of things. In t4~
Committee we may get ail the necessary information, and when the Bill cornes back ta
the Senate, we may take notice osf any extra
expense that m'ay-be invoived with doubotful
resuits.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading of the Bill.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I should

ta any case in which the present Act has
failed to sustain an action for perjury brought
under the conditions mentioned?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My honourabIe
friend must h-ave noticed the words that are
struck eut of subsection 2 of section, 5. The
Act as it stands on the Statute Book reads
as foiiows:
"2. If witb respect to any question a witness objecta

Tbe words that it is inttended te strike

doubts of the wisdom. of rushing through
am-endmen'ts of this kind un-less they are supported by some fundamental principle, or by
some English authorities.
How dues this

anybody know?
Perhaps the Deputy Minister of Justice could say whether a similar
Act is in force in other countries, andi whether
it lias bee.n found unworkabie there, and could
give us other information in regard ta it. The
idea, I liad in introducing the amendment
ta the Canada Evidence Act this Session was
ta follow the Englisli Act, on which we had
a great many decisions. We had something
to go upon.

3914,

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: The intention of
the ameniment is to remove the crime of
perjury from the section whieh pratects the
witne.9s against prosecutian on account of lis
own evidence. That is, lie is ta lie absolutely
protccted against prosecutian for niurder,
arson, burglary, rolYbery and variaus other
crimes; you cannot use bis evidence against

prevail of giving recognition ta a medical
man of any province in the Dominion? It
seems ta me that w'e are simply stamping
approval upon the narrow and contracted
doctrine of provincialism. Why sbould not
a doctor aut.horized ta practice medicine in
Quebec give a certificate if he is here, just

After a considerable struggle the Roddick Bill became

practicing in another land altogether? It is
most extraordinary.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that the
word "physician' had never been defined under

Sections 2 to 5, inclusive, were agreed to.
On section 6-certain excepted preparations:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

result of the Conference at Geneva. It was
agreed to strike out heroin.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: The note says:
The object of this amendment is to eliminate codeine
from the Act.

I have not got the Act here, and I do not
know exactly what that means. Does it
mean that the use of codeine is eliminated
entirely?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am informed
that codeine is not a habit-forming drug,
and it has been so held hy the Conference
held lately in Geneva. Heroin is a very
dangerous drug.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Is it going to pro-

hibit codeine altogether?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It will remove
codeine from the Federal Act entirely, but
leave it in the Provincial Pharmacy Act.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I understand that
the risk of a heavy fine or imprisonment is
so great

that

heroin at all.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is a good
result. The doctors will still be able to
prescribe heroin, but it will not enter into
proprietary remedies.
lon. Mr. MeMEANS.

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I have no objection to thut; but I am informed that if a
doctor prescribes it, he cannot get it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I understand
that the practitioners have declared that they
did not want to prescribe it, and it has been
completely eliminated.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I have heard from
a very prominent physician that people cannot get it at a drug store any longer. However, that is a matter of no consequence.
Section 6 was agreed to.
Sections 7 and 8 were agreed to.
On section 9-power of police officer to
search for drugs:
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Wlhat is the note on
that section?
The Hon. The CHAIRMAN: The note
says that the words to be added to section 18,
"and, if necessary. by force, to search any
person here found," would empower
-a police officer to search suspected persons on the street
for narcotics, without the necessity of having to first
obtain a search warrant. This has long been advocated
by the police authorities throughout the Dominion, in
view of the fact that this time is the essence in the
majority of these cases, where a police officer has reason
to suspect that persons are engaged in the distribution

of narcotics, or peddling them on the streets.
present they are powerless ta act until they first obtain
a search warrant, and of course, the time involved in
hunting up a Magistrate or Judge, to obtain the necessary starch warrant, in the daytime, is very considerable, and prevents the police from taking prompt
and efficient action to apprehend these traffickers; not
to mention the difficulties involved in cases of this nature at night, Saturday afternoons, Sundays and holidays, when the magistrates and judges are not available in the Courts. Most of these drug traffickers knov
that they are almost immune from search or being
molested on the street, as the police have not the powe:
to hold therm up and search them for suspected drugs
This, of course applies in most of the larger cities
where the traffic is most extensive.

Section 9 was agreed to.
Section 10 was agreed to.
On section 11-schedule amended:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This is simply
to carry out section 6. to eliminate codeine

SUSPENSION

OF RULE

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH moved:
That rule 119 be suspended so far as it relates to
Bill W4, an Act respecting certain patents of Accounting and Tabulating Machine Corporation.

He said: This is a Bill referred to the
Commissioner of Patents, regarding the validity of certain patents which have lapsed
owing to the non-payment of fees or failure
to manufacture. The Company has 'been
financially involved, but is now in a position
to go ahead with the manufacture of machines

NATIONAL DEBT AND FISCAL POLICY
INQUIRY AND DISCUSSION

Hon. LENDRUM McMEANS rose in acceordance with the following notice:

That he will draw the attention of t'he Senate to
ths enormonus growth of our National Debt, and to
the unsatisfactory condition of our Fiscal Policy, and
inquire of the Government if it intends to change its
Fiscal Policy this Session.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, I rise to
make this inquiry with a great deal of diffidence, but in the hope that, after I have laid
before this honourable House some facts and
figures regarding the fmaniedal position of
Canada, the honourable leader of the Government may give some explanation that will
shed a ray of hope on the future of Canada.
Owing to the unsatisfactory condition existing in this country regarding our fiscal policy
and our growing obligations, I am impelled
to ask the indulgence of the House while I
attempt to place before it some thoughts that
have been running through my head during
the last few months.
This country is, figuratively speaking, staggering under an awful load of public debt.
The last figures show that our National Debt
stands at $2,419,000,843. This in itself is
appalling, but it is not all. In addition to
this, we have our railway obligations, which
in reality are part of our national debt. On
March 31st of this year, our commitment in
connection with our railways was $913,913,083, making a total of what can be fairly called
our Federal debt of $3,333,000,756.29.
This
for a population of less than nine millions of
people is appalling, and makes thoughtful
people ask, how long can the taxpayer stand
the pressure? It means a fixed charge for
Federal debt alone of over $370 for every
man, woman and child in Canada. In the

face of this 9aaing situation, we lied ne
reasonable effort made to eut down expenses
le any big way. The Goveremeet goes on
making large expenditures entailing enormous
taxation. The question now is, how long can
the people stand the strain?
We ied thai this year alone the debt has
been increased by $2,059,932, and that the
interest charges atone amnount to $129,185,911.
xxhich excveds the total revenue from customns
for the year. as stated on page 3,133 of the
Canada Gazette for April 11, 1925, by over
$20,000,000.
For instance, and in addit6on to the
enormous growth of our national debt, there
has been no intelligent or camnent attcmpt
made %atrcîreechment. Our expenditure on
capital accouet is, considering the financial
position ni Canada, simply outrageous, and
shows a contempt for public opinion and for
the safeîv of our country that bs very difficult,

This editorial, coupled with the statemient

seriou, situation, and one that fully justifies
ans' honourable gentleman in this House la

JUNE 9, 192540
asking its indulgence while hie tries to point
a way out of some of aur difficulties.
Our farmers in the Western Provinces seem
to think that a protective tariff policy for
Canada injures tem, and that free trade would
be of assistance.
Such a conclusion is, in
my opinion, absolutely wrong. 1 subinit that
that no group or class in the D*ominion of
Canada would derive greater advantages than
the farmers on the prairies under a real
National Policy systemn founded upoýn fiscal
arrangements which would proteet ail classes
including our farmers.
A wise patriotic. policy would reduce our
purchases fromn the United States, and balance
their purchases from us, thus stopping the
yearly drain on aur capital resources.
It
would proývide a lever which would open preferred markets abroad for the surplus farm
producte of Canada, through bargaining tariffs.
The prairie farmers seem to forget that the
carniage of wheat keeps the railways busy for
onily a portion of the year, and that other
freight is absolu.tely necessary to operate them
at a profit for the balance of the year.
By
increasing aur trade with Europe and Asia,
through tariff bargaining, thousands of tons of
additional freight and greatly increased passenger traffic would move east and west over
the railways in Canada. The resulting traffle
would wipe out Canadian National Railway
deficits, which now burden every Canadian taxpayer, and benefit other transportation
systemns, reduce federal taxation and provide
the only immediately practical basis for
freight rate reductions.
This country is buying annually millions of
dollars worth more gonds from the UJnited
States than that country buys frein Canada.

During the five years end-ing March 31,
1915, Canada bought goods tao the value of
$1,200.00O,0O0, lfrom the United States inex
ccss of United Staites purchases from Canada.
Duning the five years ending Masich 31, 1924,
Canada bo>ught. goods from, the United States
ta the value of $1,400,00,0O0 in excea of
United States purchases frùm Canada. As a
result, raiiway cars arc c<Ymlng into Canada
from the United States fillled. with goods, and
large numbers af these cars are going baïck
empty or partially fi'lled. These goods imported from the United States ýgive the Canadian railways the minimum freight hýaul, for
the practice of United Staites shippers is ta
use their own railrways to, thre fullest extent
in nroving trafflc destined 'ta points in Canada. As a rule, these excessive importationfram the United States aire bililed aven United
States raà'lway lines ta the last part of exit
into Canada. It is only foity-five mniles frein
the barder ports of ýQuebec province up to the
city of Montreal, and ithe gr-eat bulk of these
imported goods destined ta the province csf
Quebec find their market within fifty miles of
the United States boundary. Thus, these importations funnish ýlittle earning power ta
railways ini Canada.
W.ithmn. onýe hundred miles of the border
ports of Ontario the great bulk of our importations froin the United States destined to
tIrat Province are consumed, and again Canadian railways find Jittle advantage -or profit
in hauling these importations in Ontario.
The great oonsuming sections of the Province oif Manitoba lie within seventy-flve or
eighty màles of rthe American boun-dary, and
the immense imnportat.ions from, the United
States, for consumption within this area, are
nat of much profit or helip to the railway
prct>lem in Mânitoba. The same facts apply
ta all these importations from thre United
States, aI (the way througIr ta thre Pacific
Coast, because the majoeity af the ôonsuming
centres of the Western Provinces are close ta
the. Un.ited ,States boundary. Freight front the
United States diispliaces freiglit whircI otherw'î,se would -travel east and west over Canadian
transcontinental lines, also it diefpiaces European freight which should -land at Canadian

aur rafflways. At present vessel are crossing

These figures are all for 1923. They are typical.
They show that American rates are 14 per cent higher
then Canadian rates, while the sale of freighlt charges
lu other countries is from three to six times higher
than that w'hich obtains here.
Tie facts just given establish incontrovertibly the
statement that the grain growers of Canada enjoy rates
much below these which their competitors have to pay
in other countries. ,
Nat only is that itrue, but it is also true that the
farmers enjoy lower rates than do the Canadien producers of any other commodity. There are ten classifications. The first class dncludes merchandise and
manufactures, into which has entered a high measure
of 'human skill and labour. It pays the highest rate.
Grain is in the eighth class, and live stock in the
ninth. That means there are seven classes which pay
higher tolls than do grain and live stock. The tenth
class takes in such coarse and bulky raw materials as
coal, sand, gravel and se on, which in themselves
carry but a small measure of human skill and labour.
The difference between the charges for first-class
freight and eighth class has juet been shown. Yet
it is 'peculiarly significant that the agitation which bas
brought about .the present crisis comes from those who
are concerned with the eight and ninth classes. Those
who pay audh higher tolls are not complsining.
The efforts now being made in Canada to force down

rates on western grain have had a parallel in the
United States. After agitating for many monthe, the
appellants finally brought the matter to an issue before
the Intestate Commerce Cornision a Washington.
A long and exhaustive hearing followed. After weighing all the evidence on its merits, the judgment of the
Commission was that "we find the existing scale of
rates just."
That occurred considerably less ýthan a
yes.r ago.
The point which appropriately demands consideration
on this work of the line is, that American rates on
expert wheat work out on a levei about t'hirty per
cent higher than the Canadian rates. In all respects,
the conditions of rilway operation and grain marketing
are essentially the same on both sides of the boundary.
A factor in that long hearing at Washington was the
quotation of a finding by the Departrnent of Commerce
that the cost of producing wheat on the Canadien
prairies, owing to lower overhead and otiher conditions,
was 40 cents per 'bushel less than in the western states.
If tihat is true, then t follows that the Canadien
grain grower in ithe West has tihe double advantage
ef the lowest cost of production and the lowest
carrying rates in the world.

I have read that statement, honourable
gentleman, especially for the purpose of showing what is the opinion in the western country
in regard to freight rates.
I do not agree
with that, and I am not one of those who
say freight rates should not be reduced. While
the Government of the day is discussing
freight rates in another place-and the Crowsnest rates, I believe, are now limited to wheat
and flour-they are always holding out the bait

405

to the Western farmer, or to the Progressive
Party, that freight rates are going te be reduced.
In my opinion the Western farmer
bas been fooled by this procedure.
I suppose almost every honourable member
of this House received a statement from the
Western United States Railways, representing
67 railways, at the bottom of which appears
the following:
Their petition for orders which would give them a
net return of 51 per cent, means a request for about
$185,000,000 more than received by these railways during the year 1924.

How can the Government justify itselff
in holding out any hope to the Western
farmers that freight rates are going to be
decreased.
Is it honest?
No, a sop in the
way of the Crowsnest Pass rates bas been
thrown to the Progressive, and now, in order to
rid itself of the problem, the Government bas
decided to turn it over to the Railway Commission, giving it full power and authority
to regulate rates, and in this way avoid any
further criticism on the part of that party
by which it holds its power.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Does the honourable gentleman believe that the Parliament of Canada is the proper forum in which
to discuss railway rates and fix them?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: No, but I believe
the Government of Canada bas camouflaged
too long. The work is put on the Railway
Commission; then there is an appeal; then the
matter is referred to the Supreme Court.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The Government did not refer to the Supreme Court:
there was an appeal direct by the appellants.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Am I not right in
saying the Government refuses to make a
decision?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The Government was not to settle the law points until it
was decided what interpretation was to be
given to the Act.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: My contention is
that the people of Canada are being fooled
at the present time. My honourable friend is
a representative from the Province of Quebec.
$5,000,000 more is going to be given to the
port of Quebec. How much bas it cost the
people of Canada to try te make a port there?
$200,600,000 was spent on that colossal blunder,
the Transcontinental railway, so that freight
could be carried to Quebec at a rate of six
cents per bushel in 1916. That money was
spent to make Quebec a port; but Quebec is
not a port to-day. And what did the Government do? That rate was increased 400
per cent, up to 25 cents a bushel, and to-day

And still the
of Quebec is 20 odd cents.
Government comes to the people of Canada
and takes another 5,000,000 out of their pockets
to do something down at that port which has
been losing money for the last eight or ten
years, and which has never paid a cent of
interest on the loans which it has had. This
is another thing I cannot understand.
I am
looking for light.
I say candidly to the
honourable gentleman that if ho can give me
any information that will show that I am
putting the case too strongly, I will be only
too delighted to receive it.
I would like
some explanation of why the freight rate is
so high on the Transcontinental, which was
built at such great expense to make Quebec a
port.
It must be acknowledged that it has
been a failure.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Does my honourable friend think the $5.000,000 advance
to the Quebec Harbour Board is not smaller
than the $25,000,000 advanced by his own
friends to the port of Halifax?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I am condemning
the expenditure, and I do not care whether
it was made by my friends or by gentlemen
opposite. You are in power to-day, and I
do say that .some curb should be put upon
expendiitures.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
agreed on that.

We

all

Hon. Mr. MoMEANS:
I am very glad
of that. I was sure I would have the honourable gentleman's synpathy when I took
that stand.
The elevator at Quebec handled only 5,000,000 bushels of wheat and abcut 1.500 head
of cattle last year, and it has cost this country about $200.000.000 to develop. I would be
more than pleased to see some reduction in
the freight rates of the West, but I would
like to have a true s'atement of the facts
frcm those who are in power to-day.
If this statement is correct, and I have no
doubt that it is, then it is fairly conclusive
evidence that the farmers or wheat growers
of Western Canada enjoy, in freight rates
alone, a great advantage over their American
competitors. Not only do they enjoy 25 per
cent or 30 per cent less carrying charges on
their products, but, according to the evidence
adduced before an American Committee of
-nvestigation, they are enabled to produce
vheat at forty cents per bushel. less than the
American wheat growers; so that it is fair
to say that they occupy a very much better
position than any farmers or w-hat growers
in the world.
Hon. Mr'. MeMEANS.

Now, if this is so, and I submit the evidence
goes to prove that it is so, then why all this
whining and destructive agitation carried on
by a cliss who are enjoying so many advantages over their fellow competitors in ali parts
of the world
I believe that the Progressive movement in
Western Canada has been brought about by
lack of political foresight on the part of the
Government. They are a group upon whom
the Government of the Day depends when it
comes to a question of want of confidence. I
think it is only reasonaible to say that when
you take anything from the body politic as
a whole. and hand it over to a class which
repre-ents a small minority, you are weakening
the whole system under which we live. I am
glad to say that I believe the Progressive
movemen is dying out, and that the farmers
of the West are beginning to realize the position of the country and the failure of the
present Government to build up the industries
of the country, and the extravagance, and
they will soon change their minds and go
back to the old-time system of two parties,
such as we had when the good old Conservative Party ran this country and ran it with
succ1ess.

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: They certainly will
not go back to the Conservative Party.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE:

The best of them will.

A rcal national tariff poiicy would, I submit, accompiisb this resuit. It would develop
the manufacturing industries, and consequentiy
add stiil more to the volume of freight arising
froým the carniage of raw materiais, semiflnished and flnisbed goods, and the volume
of passenger traffic, by increasing the popu-lation. Thus conditions would rapidly develop,
which wouid give iower freight rates both on
goods shipped in to the farimers in the Prairie
Provinces, and on their farm products ship¶ped
out.
A generai tariff whicb wouid, balance our

this diversion of trade. This wouid almost
certainly iead to negotiations by which the

to Western iive stock. It must be ciear to
every thinking man that this country cannot
open preferred foreign markets for our great
exportable products by freely giving ýaway our
domestie markets, as we are now doing, to the
produets of other countries.
To open preferred markets abroad for Canadian agricuiturai products, this country must
have a generai tariff sufficient to previde a
basis for successful bargaining. This is tbe
procedure which. nearly ail other countries
fodlow.
For instance, wben the Government representatives of the British West Indies came to
Canada te negotiate for an arrangement of
tariff
preferences between those British
Dominions and Canada, tbey enumerated their
principal exports, viz: raw sugar, cocoa beans,
rum, limes. arrowroot, etc. Tbey said to
Canada: 'You must give us substantial. preferences upon these produets, or no treaty can
be ne.-otiated." They wanted preferred eutlets for their principal products in exebange
for preferences granted in their markets te
Canadian producta. Thua they bargained with
Canada and got an arrangement, under eustoms tariff rates. If they had net had a pro-

407

tective tariff, they could flot have secured
this preference for their principal exporta.
When France opens negotiations with another country for a trade treaty, hier negotiators always have before themn the principal
products of France which are exportable, aad
France by negotiating trade treaties seeks to
develop ma.rkets for these exporta.
France bas greatly increased ber custoins
tariffs in order to have a better basis for bargaining for special tariff favours frein other
countries. In the officiai journal of the Board
of Trade Department of the British Government, issued January 8, 1925, page 54, it is
stated that the reason wby France is again
rncreasin, bier tariff is that she may make
reductions therefrom when bargaining withi
other countries for -prcfcrred markets for ber
goods, witbout sucb reductinns crippiing hier
own domestic industries, viz:
The Explanatory Memnorandum to the
French Bill, after referring to th.e general
tariff revision now in hand, describes the nature
and purpose of the present proposai, which is
not intended to replace or delay the normal
tariff revision, but is neccssary to enable
France properiy to negotiate the important
commercial agreements now under consideration. The Bill therefore proposes to increase
tariff duties affc'cting Frencb industries whicb,
owing to the burden resulting from the war,
cannot face unlimited foreign coýmpetition with
the present duties, bearing in mind the fact
that goods from certain countries, at present
subjeet to ",Generail" tariff rates, wiil probabiy
in future become entitlied to "minimumn"
tariff rates, or to rates of duty intermediate
bctween the "General" and "Minimum" tariff
rates.
France realizes tbe wisdom of tarifas sufficiently high to proteet and to enable bier to
negotiate successfully for preferences in
foreign markets.
Another example: the United States controis the markets of Cuba by reason of exclusive tariff preferences arranged between
the two countries. Simiiiariy, she controis the
markets of Hawaii, the Phillippinea, Alaska,
Porto Rico, etc.
In this country we are heavy exportera of
farm producta to Europe; yet, because littie
attention is being- given to fundamentai considerations affecting Canadian National development, nothing is bein-g done toward openrng preferred markets abroad for these produets. Why this negleet of such an important
matter?
France assesses very high duties, about 37

wheat. In adition, these countries apply embargoes against importations. The effort of
Spanish millers to obtain Canadian hard wheat
is indicated by the following petition addressed
to their own Government, soliciting the right
to import Canadian hard wheat, viz:
Importations of Foreign Wheat
Madrid, May 6.-The discussion between the Catalan
farmers and millers over the importation of wheat continues. The Millers persist in demanding the authorization to import 10,000 tons of hard Manitoba wheat,
which thes say, is absolutely necessary for their industry, and whiel they could obtain much more cheaply
than hard Spanish wheat, for which they are asked
up to 63 pesetas per metric quintal. There is no sigo
ait present that they are likely to obtain this authorizalion.
Reuters' Trade Service--Extract from Chamber
of Commerce Journal, London, May 18, 1923.

These are only examples of many restrictions applied by other countries which serve
to restrict foreign markets for Canadian products. Yet both these countries and other
countries are large importers of wheat. They
have to import large quantities of wheat because they do not produce sufficient for their
own needs. However, the importations are
restricted to an extent that makes it extremely difficult for them to obtain Canadian
hard wheat.
This policy of driving hard bargains for
preferred markets for their exportable products is no confined to France, Spain, and
the United States.
Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, and all the other European
industrial countries pursue the same policy;
and I submit the general tariff of Canada
should be drafted along similar lines, so as to
provide a lever with which this country could
open preferred markets abroad for the surplus
farm products of Canada.

The result of examination and enquiries extending
over tiree or four years is now seen in the proposed
new General Tariff.
It is a Tariff for negotiating
purposes. The rates on the msajority of articles have
been increasei considerably, with the idea that high
rates will prove a weighty instrument for negotiations
with other Powers. Such a Tariff is regarded as particularly essential to a small country 1-ike
Switzerland,
whose national prosperity is so closely bound up with
its export industries.
Experience bas indeed shown
that, as the neiglibouring countries are all strictly Protectionist, the Free Trade principles practised
by
Switzerlanîd before 1902 are unfavourable to the national
indust ry.

The present United States tariff is designed
to prevent the importation of Canadian wheat
and live cattle, except by payment of duties,
which will raise the cost of such importations
to almost prohibitive figures. The Congressional Reports, at the time when the present
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS.

United States tariff was being considered by
Congress, clearly establish the truth of this
statement. And no change of this policy can
come from the present Canadian policy of
making free gifts to the United States of
Canadian markets through reductions in the
tariff of Canada.
Extract from the Report of the Emergency Tariff
Bill, as submitted by the Committee on Ways and
Means of the United States House of Representatives,
April 13, 1921.
Wheat is one of the products which we have admitted to our country in large quantities which have
seriotusly isturbed and depressed our domestie market
tl the great loss of wheat growers.
The months of
Sepîtenber, October, November and December are those
duîring which hie marketing of wheat is most active.
Duing these months last year our markets were demoralized by the receipt from Canada for domestie

there are 35,000,000 bushels of wheat at Fort William,
Canada, awaiting the openirg of navigation, which wili

wviiistand the pressure brought by continually increas.ing our -irplus
by importation.
As a result of these
importations prices have declined rapidly, being now
far lielow the cost of production, and the American
wlheat grower faces destruction.
It is essential that
thi hill he passed quickly in order to prevent the
dum ping of the wheat just referred to, as well as
ohrsimnmodities mentioned in the bill.

This quotation shows conclusively how the
Americans protect and guard their farmers
and producers. Surely it is time we adopted
the same policy by the use of a truly National Protective Policy.
Before the Great War every industrial
country in the world except Great Britain
pursued internal industrial development behind high tariff walls. Since the war, these
walls of industrial countries have all been
greatly strengthened and increased in height,
except in Canada, where the opposite policy
has been pursued. These other countries, by
high tariff walls, exclude Canadian manufactures whilst urgently seeking Canadian raw
materials. For example, this fact is described
by the United States Government, officially,
on page 265 of " Commerce Reports," No. 44,
published November 3, 1924, in the following
words:
Economically and socially Canada may be considered
as a northern extension of the United States and our
trade with Canada is in many respects more like donmestic trade than our foreign trade with other countries. The movement of industrial raw materials from
Canada into the United States and the return flow of
t
a miscel anseous asortment of partly or wholly manufactured goods is not unlike a similar flow between the
West and South, and the more industrialised northeastern part of the United States.

The foregoing is further substantiated by
the United States Tariff Commission's report

materials would in turn be stimulated by
their larger markets and would require more
cars to handle raw material into their plants.
I may say just here, with regard to the
glass factory in Hamilton, if I understand the
situation rightly, that after they were forced
to close down for want of a protection policy,
and the Belgium glass came in, the price of
the Belgium glass was higher than that of
the glass manufactured in Hamilton. So the
people in Canada did not gain anything from
a reduction in price.
Then, we only produce about fifty per cent
of the salt we consume; but this gives our
railways 6,000 carloads per annum. If Canada produced the remaining 6,000 carloads,
which we ought to do, but which are now
imported, the production costs and selling
prices of salt in Canada would be lower than
at present, and hundreds of men would be
employed and our railways would get this
extra business, which would be considerable.
I submit this can all be brought about by
the adoption of a real National Policy for
Canada-a policy that would make Canada
independent of the great nation to the south,
and make this country something more than
hewers of wood and drawers of water for
American Industries.
What in my opinion would be a real National Policy?
It would, protect every legitimate indýustry
against outside competition; that is, it would
raise the tariff sufficiently high to guarantee
the Canadian markets to the Canadian producers. By doing this, we would enable all
our great industries to run at full capacity,
which would mean the employment of thousands of men who are now walking our streets.
It would also be 'the means of bringing back
to Canada thousands of men who have crossed
the line seeking employment that they could
not get in Canada on account of the fact that
many of our industries were closed, and many
more running on half time.
In addition to the employment of men, it
would create a great protected home market
for our farmers; and everyone who has given
any thought to this question realizes that the
home market is by far the best market for
our farmers.
While I advocate a real Protective Policy,
I would expect and insist on the manufacturers playing the game: first, by producing
as good products as could have been imported from outside sources, if there were no
tariffs; second, by treating the consuming
Hon. Mr. McMEANS.

public fairly, that is, by selling their products
at a price that would be fair to the consumer.
I can well understand that there are industries that would find it almost impossible
to sell their products to the consumer at
prices equal to the price thait similar goods
might be imported for. For instance, take
our market gardeners. It would be absolutely
unfair to expect these men to compete against
cheap southern labour and climatic conditions, therefore we would have to make allowances for conditions over which we have
no control; and if the market gardener were
giving to the people as a whole an equivalent for the increased price that he might
receive for his product, that is, in the way of
creating and stabilizing his industry all over
Canada, and making this country thoroughly
independent of any other country, as far as
the market gardening industry is concerned,
then I believe that the country would be
justified in protecting this industry, and on
the whole, Canada would bo benefited.
This same argument might be applied to
other industries; and where it could be
demonstrated that the country was getting
back, in the way of employment, thousands of
men, and retaining in our country hundreds
of thousands of dollars that otherwise would
be paid out to foreign countries, and creating great home markets for our farmers, these
circumastances would certainly be worthy of
serious thought and might justify a Commission to decide that such industries were
entitled to something more than imported
goods could be purchased for.
But, outside
of these contingencies, which ought not to
occur in many of our industries, the manufacturers, farmers and gardeners ought not
and would not be ail>wed to profiteer and
ask unreasonable prices on account of the
protected markets which they were enjoying.
This, I believe, coul:d be brought about by
the creation of a small but expert Investigating Tariff Commission, which would be
clothed with ample power, that would enable
it to visit any and every industry, and to
examine into every detail of production, so
that it might assure itself that the protected
industries were not taking unfair advantage of
the protection given them.
The findings of
this Commission would be reported ta the
Government.
The Government must assume
full respoiibility for every phase of the tariff
question of Canada.
Then, again, a true National Policy would
develop our coal mines.

But if Canada adopts a policy that willd supply

ing a great paper industry.
cords we exported had been manufactured in
Canada before expert, we would have received
$73 per cord more, or 6102,000,000.
If we are to benefit in full from our great
natural resources, I submit they must not be
exported in their raw state. At present we
are littie better than hewers of wood and
drawers of water for our neighbors to the
south, who have built up great industries by
the use of raw matefrials secured from Canada.
We supply the wood in its raw state ta, make
fully one-quarter of ail the newsprint used in
I subit every cord of
the United States.
this wood should be manufactured i Canada,
which if done would increase immensely our
paper industry, give employment to thousands

of men, and add greatly to the ho-me market
for the productis of the soiT.
1 would apply this same policy te Our
mineral produots all of which, as fax as
practicable. should be treated in Canada.
This would create ether large industries, which
would employ thousands of our people, and
provide more marke'te for our farmers.
A courageous policy must be adopted if this
country is to be saved from the doom that is
looming on its horizon.
As I stated a moment ago, Canada produces 90 per cent of aIl the ashestos produced
in the world, and the, United States gets 90
per cent of this in its ra-w etate. We get for
this raw material an average of from $5,000,000 to $6,000,000 a year. Our astute neighbor
turns t-his into over 8100,000,000 worth of
rnanuffactured goods, and in doing se creates
lar-ge industrial centres, employing thousands
of bhands and creating a large home market
for the American fax-mer.
If Canada is ever geing to be a great nation
we must art promptly and stop the drain on
our natural resources in their raw state. The
policy that I suggest insures a, large percentage of our raw material being manufactured
in Canada, and the creation of large industries
providing work for thousands of employees,
consequently giving a living to, hundreds of
thousande of Canadian citizens, and creating
a splendid home market for the produets of
the farm.
Surely the creatien of great industries ought
to be the aim of every citàzen of this country.
This, in my opinion, is absolutely -impossible
under our present tariff regulations. We have
great natural resources, but they are net
by any means inexhaustible. These reseurces
are beiog drained out of this country by
millions of dollars annually, going to build
up great rnanufacturing centres, providing
employment for hundreds of thousands of
employees, and ereating immense hoine
markets for the fax-mer of the United States.
Surely, honourable gentlemen, this is a suicidal policy for Canada.
I submit, we have neyer had a truly
National Policy. True, we have had a protective system, which did much for the upbuilding of Canada, and which was maintained by bath parties for a perriod of over
thirty years, but it did net aocoxnplish all
that it should have done, largely on acceunt
of the continual tinkering that was resorted
to from time to time-lowering the tariff, trying to please the advocates of a low tariff;
and again, because the policy did net control the export cf our raw materials, ner dlid
it protect the consuimer as a truly National

112

SENATE

Policy ought to do. Under this so called
Protection Policy the manufacturers beciame
"a law unto themselves"; the more unscrupulous members of that fraternity taking unfair
advantage of the protection afforded by the
state. In consequence of this fact and others,
in many cases the .products manufactured and
sold to the Canadian consumers were very
much inferior to the imported article, and
the consumer was compelled to pay higher
prices for inferior goods. This is one of the
things that the consumer must be protected
aganst.
These are some of the reasons why protection became unpopular, especially with the
farmers, who felt that they were not being
fairly treated, being 'compelled to pay higher
prices for inferior goods, especially for farm
machinery.
The compiaint became general that many
of the manufacturers enjoying protection
were not playing the game. Now, I submit,
a policy, such as I have outlined, properly
enforced, would protect every cl'ass in Canada against unfair profiteering, and the industries of Canada would be placed on a
sound business basis, and no class would benefit more than the farmers of this country,
who would enjoy a very much increased home
market on account of the development of the
industrial centres throughout the country.
The creation of great industries w>uld
stinnilate trade in all directions, and give to
our railrways the traffic that is so much needed
to enable them to carry on successfully, and
not only puy their way, but in a very' few
years much of the awful burden of railway
debt wouild be lifted from the shoulders of
the people of this country, and a great home
market would be secured for the farmers of
Canada.
After all, the home market is by far the
most important for our Canadian farmers.
Even now, with our rather limited industrial
centres, we consume fully 90 per cent of our
farm products excluding our wheat, and over
80 per cent including our wheat crop. This
market can be very much inereased by a
truly National Policy that will protect all
classes fairly.
Surely, honourable gentlemen, this home
market is the important market to protect
and develop in the interest of the real farmer.
Why should the wheat-grower be permitted
to cammand the situation in an effort to improve his own position at the expense of the
real farmer who operates his farm twelve
months of the year, and net six months, as
in the case of 75 per cent of the Western
wheat-growers?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS.

While I realize the handicap of the long rail
haul that the Western wheat-grower faces, I
think the facts that I have stated demonstrate
that he is in a much better position than his
natural competitor, the wheat-grower of the
Dakotas and Minnesota, and ahl the wheatgrowing states, whose freight rates are all the
way from 20 to 30 per cent higher. However, I
believe the Government of Canada ought to
do everythiing that is reasonable to help overcome the handicap of distance that the graingrower of Western Canada is up against; but
it ought net to b done at the expense of the
whole farming industry of Canada, which
bas suffered and is suffering from lack of
proper protection and proper encouragement
in the way of great home markets which Canada can and ought to have by encouraging
more industries.
I veniture to say there is no pla)ce in the
world whcre the same class of people as those
who have settled in the three Western
Provinces could have accomplished one-half
of what they have accomplished in the same
time. If thev have met reverses, they have
simply been up against what every other
class of people has been up against. I have
no doubt that many of their troubles can
bh traiced to the same eause that has brought
trouble on ail our cities as well as our rural
districts. that is, extravagance. It seems that
no class bas been froe from that, and all
have -uffered.
The ýtime has come now,
surely, to pull together and realize that we
have a great heritage that can be made greater
by harmonizing our differences, and getting
back to a sane position in the social as well
as the business world.
I have only to add, honourable gentlemen,
ihat it is a great blessing that Canada is probably the richest country in the world in the
wxay of undeveloped resources; but how long
are we going to be able to withstand the
export of our natural products-our nickel, our
nsbestos, and our pulpwood? These things
xxill not last forever; and if the cost of Governient keeps on increasing year by year,
thus adding to the publie debt, then all that
I can say is, God help the country.
lon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I take it for
granted that no other honourable gentleman
irtends to rise to place upon Hansard his
views on the present financial situation of
Canada, or of exigencies which would call for
some fiscal policy other than the one we have.
That being so, I vill answer my honourable
friend br:cfiy.
Hon. JOHN McCORMICK: Wouild the
honourable gentleman permit me to offer some
observations in regard to this matter?

JIJNE 9, 1Mt2
I may say, honourable gentlemen, that I arn
in full accord with the sentiments expressed
by the honourable gentleman who bas just
addressed you from this side of the Huse
(Hon. Mr. McMeans). Population is generally regarded as one of the things most necessary to this country; and from year to year
we are disappointed not. only that immigration
is decreasing, but that, as is acknowledged by
every man who reads the press, we are losing
population at the rate of 200,000 a year. What
i.s the use of taking about making the railways
a succcss if we cannot retain the population
that we have? The reason for their failure is
not far to seek. An honourable gentleman got
up in this Hious-e the other day and made a
statement that must have been surprising to
others as well as to myself. H1e asked what
was the use of manufacturing cotton or textiles
in this country; in fact, he stated that we
should not try to manufacture themn because
we did not grow cotton in this country, entirely
forgetting the fact that they do no t grow
cottoiî in England, Ireland, Scotland or Wales,
and that tbe bulk of the raw material manufactured in Great Brifain has to be taken
thousands of miles over the sea. It is no
wonder this country is in its present condition when men in Parliament and professional
men miake statements of that kind.
Now, what do we flnd with regard to, railway rates? We find men on the prairies complaining in recent ycars because they have
not been granted concessions that have been
denied to others. But not only do we find
that; we find also that in sonie sections freight
has been carried at a loss for the benefit of the
people of those sections while others have had
to bear the loss. These are .some of the things
that must be remedicd, things that this bouse
and Parliament must addrcss themselves to.
We cannot go on year after year losing population and thereby paralyzing industry. In the
Province of Nova Scotia, as a result of want
of policy or, in fact, as a result of discrimination, villages have been almost entirely depopulated.
Wbat do we find on the Pacific coast as
compared with the East as to the rates charged
for carrying freight? The rate from the East
to a place like Winnipeg is $10M0 a hundred.
the rate from the West is $4.08k. The rate
to Toronto from the East is 82.12; from the
West $1.67. In the matter of fish which is
almost entirely transported hy the Government road, we find a discrimination against our
people; and that discrimination is in favour of
American fishing vessels, because our people
have to pay a duty of 2 cents a pound when
they send halibut into the United States

413

These are tbings that we think ought to be
redressed.
The other day an announcement was made
with regard to railway rates. It was stated
in another place that the Railway Board would
handle the question. That is a board of
experts created by the statesman Sir Wilfrid
Laurier, and no doubt it is composed of men
ivbo should handle the matter. But what is
the suggestion? Under the Crowsnest Pass
rates the farmers ship wheat and flour at less
than cost; and it is provided that no increase
on those rates shaîl be made. Therefore the
Railway Board will be precluded from charging proper rates for those articles which constitute a vrery large part of the traffic carried
1w the railroads.
Yet, we bave the statement of Mr. Long,
Traffic Manager of the Canadian National
Railways, that if railway rates had increascd
since 1923, in the same proportion as other
commodity prices, the Governmnent systema
would have earned, $35,000,000 more last year
than in 1923.
But we find that this matter
of railwýay ra'tes is to be placed in the hands of
the Railway Board, whieh will he r)prliided
(rom 'making any change in those things.
Wby should that be?
Are the farmrn-s of
the Prairies in such a position, that tbe other
people of the country, already heavily taxed,
should have no reduction at all?
Is it
reasonable that otbe-s should býe called upon to
pay high rates for the transportation of their
goods in order to help to pay for the transportation of the flour and grain of the Prairie
Provinces?
These are sýome of the things that cause dis-

satisfaction; these are some of the reasons why
people are discontented and are leaving at the
rate of 100,000 a year.
It seems to me that if there is an easy way
of accomplishing anything without placing
any burden on someone else, it is the most
desirable way to do it.
Here we are expoi-ting millions of dollars worth of raw
materials yearly. Here, in the year 1923, we
have even the United States importîng fromn
this country 26,000,000 bushels of grain. What
does that prove? It proves that they are not
raising enough grain of that kind to meet
their own requirements.
Twelve million
bushels of that grain were ground into flour
for consumption in the United States. Fourteen million bushels of it were ground in the
milîs of the United States for export.
The
grain for export certainly had a remission of
the d:uty, but the bran, the middlings, and the
.shorts (rom those 14,000,000 bushels of Canadian grain were available to people in the
United States for the feeding of their stock.
Employment

was

given

to

milîs

in

the

414

SENATE

United States to that extent.
Even that
quantity was insufficient to meet the requirements of their own country. Their production
of about 700,000,000 bushels a year, only a
small proportion of the quantity which is
raised on the Canadian prairies, is not more
than is required for United States consumption.
Furthermore, 65 per cent of the flour used in
the cities of Central and South America along
the Atlantic coast is ground from North American wheat, amiost entirely Canadian, but
milled in and shipped from the United States.
Is there not in that fact something for this
Government to consider?
Let your Trade
and Commerce people make an inquiry, without prejudice to the interests of the farmers
or any other class.
Let them ascertain to
what markets of the world you are sending
your flour and your wheat to-day. Be careful
not to do anything that would interfere with
the sales in the markets that you have already,
or interfere with the possibility of increasing
sales where you have a small market. Then,
without using at all the word "retaliation,"
could not this be dont? Could it not be provided that any country taxing our wheat, as
is now being donc, to the extent of 42 cents
a bushel, or any country taxing it beyond,
say, 15 cents a bushel, should pay a corrcsponding expert tax on our wheat going into
that country?
Only a small proportion of the
700,000,000 bushels of wheat grown in the
United States is of the quality of the wheat
produced on the Canadian prairies.
What
wouild be the immediate effect?
At present
the export of Canadian wheat to the United
States provides traffic for their railvays and
for their ships, which take it to the markets
of the world.
It is used down in the West
Indies, in Mexico and in South Amrrican
countries, as well as in Europe.
The millers
now receive back the 42 cents they pay in to
the Government, but if we imposed an expert
dutv of 40 cents. they could net get that back,
and fleur would cost $1.50 or $2 a barrel more
to mill in the United States than in this
country; the entire milling and flour business
in connection with our wheat would be donc
in this country; and, as far as I can sec, it
would bt without any prejudice whatever to
the farmers of Canada.
If such a duty were
imposed by this country, where else could
wheat be obtained?
Net from the Argentine,
not from Australia or New Zealand, not from
India.
From nowhere in the world, with the
possible exception of the territory in Southern
Russia and in Siberia, from which there is no
reason to expect competition in the near
future.
If the Government addressed themselves
to some measure of that kind, it would in my
Hon. Mr. McCORMICK.

opinion confer a real benefit upon this country. The advantage, as my honourable friend
bas said. would not be conflned to the farmers.
If we are going to build up this country, retain
our population and make Canada a nation of
importance, as its natural resources entitle it
to be, we must have not merely an ordinary
tariff, but as stiff a protective tariff as prevails
in the United States. How can you expect the
farmer. for instance, or the d'airyman, or the
fruit-growers, or the market gardener to prosper
without proection? What does he find? It
is more difficult and more expensive to carry on
hi; business here than it would be south of
the line, where there are two or three crops
a year and the crops ripen earlier. No tariff
worth while is imposed for the purpose of giving these people protection
Conserve the
market for the farmers and give them some
en.couraiement to stay on the land. Do the
same thing for the farmer and the dairyman
a for the manufacturer and every o'her class.
Encourage the mining industry as much as
possible to carry on the refining of metals in
this country.
Do not send your asbestos
down to the south, or over to Belgium. or
to Germany in the raw s' ate, getting only a
pittance for it, instead of giving employment
to your own people and increasing the value
of the article.
I ans in nerfect accord with a protective
policy of this kind, and I desire to express
my en'ire opposition to the proposail that bas
bren miade regarding the Crowsnest Pas; agreement. I do not see why it shouldl be stipulated in that proposal that the Crowsnest Pass
agreement shall be maintained. That is a
concession whici enaibles tht farmers of the
prairies to have their traffic carried at less
thîn cst. and 15 or 20 per cent less than the
Arerican farmer pays for the transportation
of his goods. A United States Comnis,-cn
hi declared 'hat it costs the American farmer
35 cents a bushei more to raise a crop than
it does in our Prairie Provinces. Under these
cireumstances for what reason, or purpose, or
intention, does the Government declare that
the Railway Commission, composed of experts wlo are. devoting their time and attention to railway rates. shall be precluded frcm
having absolute control of those rates? Why
should they be told, "You may -change everything else, but you must leave the Crowsnest
rates on grain and flour."
Furthermore, in our part of the country we
are suffering from direct discrimination, of which
this Government bas knowledge. Fish is being
brought
in from British
Columbia at
about half the rate charged on our fish carried

JUNE 9, 1925
the same distance from the East. Why should
that be?
Here is another thing I want tc say. You
may not all agree-there may be differences
of opinion-about the questions concerning
the people in the Maritime Provinces known
as Maritime Rights, but there -are very substantial grounds down there for ccmplaint,
and the grievances of the people of the Maritime Provinces are deserving of redress. Do
not be under any misapprehension in this respect: the people are patient and tolerant,
but such is the spirit kindling down there
that, if thcse grievances are not redressed,
but are allowed to continue, efforts will be
made, I fear, to bring about a change in
some other manner.
There is a range of 101 articles, manufactured in these two provinces, on which the
protection given is from 20 to 35 per cent.
What is the situation in the Maritime Provinces? We have there what you do not want.
On our lumber the railway rates are prohibitive. You are discriminating against our fish.
You wiii not carry them as cheaply as they
are brought from the Pacific. You do not
want our dairy products, because you produce
more dairy products than you require. We
have a coai and steel industry, and what do
you do with regard to it? We have the finetst,
he 'onlly complete, steel plant in the Dominion
of Canada, and for 14 or 15 years the tariff
schedules have been left unchanged, without
regard to the changed conditions prevailing
in the last five or six years. The on!iy alteration was that which was made a year or two
ago, and which eut doiwn the already too sinall
tariff protection that was given to steel and
iron. The harm that was done on that occasion
is 'to a considerable extent affecting the coal
and steel industries in the Maritime Provinces. Why should that have been done?
Whether this Government cones back after
the election, or whether a new one takes its
place, the.duty on he 101 articles-textiles,
etc.-wilî remain from 20 to 35 per cent, but
the coal industry is now given a protection of
only about 10 per cent. The products manufactured in the plant at Sydney are articles
in the first stage of manufacture-bar iron,
rails, and that sont of thing; whereas the
articles produced in the factories up here are
more diversified, and in manufacturing them
use is made of ionc and Steel in the finer
stages, and on them you have a protection
that reaohes to 25, 30 or 35 per cent. There
is also provision that at the request of certain
people, or undler certain condlitions, there
may be obtained a reduction of duty.
Y esterday I met a man who is we» acquainted with the hardware business in this

415

country, especialiiy in these two provinces.
He was across the line, opposite Prescott, and
was seliling stoves of the kind that some of
the people there used. He found ithat, although
parts of stoves were brought into this country
at a duty of 15 per cent, he had to pay 40
per cent on his stoves sold in the United
States.
No
Conditions muet be investigated.
reasona.ble man can expect to compete with
the United States under existing circumstances.
The people living in Canada are not superhumain. How can we stand up against a
country with such organization, such wealth
and such diversification of industry, unless we
have protection? How can we retain our
population in the face of ihe attractions tht
are offered over there, unless we put on a
talriff. Let us not be afraid to do it. Do
not be scared because people will ask, " Why
Ehould we manufacture cotton in this country'?" Put on a tariff, and make it good and
stiff. If you make any mistake about it, make
it too high. Provision 'can be made in the
tariff to curb those people who would take
advantage of the Canadian consumer. They
could 'be deprived of tariff protection.
I have something further to say on this
subject, but, having no notes, I vill Ilimit my
remarks. Take the question of an export
duty on wheat. I want to know-tI want
somebody to tell me-what hairm cou'ld be
done by imposing such a duty. Would it
not transfer business to this country and give
it to our own mille, 'provide employment for
our own people and business for our own
railways, and more traffic for our steamers,
whose traffic you are trying to d.evel-op?
We were hopeful that a trade arrangement
had been made with Australia, but we find
now that it is tied up. The Australian Parliament has been in favour of it, but it is
now awaiting action on the part of Canada.
The reason why the proposed arrangement is
delayed is, so fer as we know, the influence
of the United States manufacturer. His influence over here is strong. The people of
Australia have increased from 25 to 75 per
cent the proportion of labour and material
of British oigin that muet be in the goods
imported into Australia under preferential
treatment. This will exclude from the preference American manufacturers of automobiles
in Canada. Automobiles form a large proportion of the imports down here. The attitude of the Government shows you the
impolicy in the long run of doing what they
are doing. If the steel and other material
used in the automobiles were made at Canadian plants, we would have no tie-up as we
have now. The whole thing seeme to be

416

SENATE

without any plan, without any consideration,
without any idea of encouraging industry and
employment and progress and the development
of the country as a whole.
I complimented this Governzment and
thanked them for having, in view of the
desperate conditions in Nova Scotia, given
us a slight advance on the import duty on
American slack coal. But when you look
at the situation you find this. Up in the
city of Hamilton is a coke plant manufacturing 320 tons of coke a day. The purpose
is to supplant American anthracite. That is
a splendid thing to do. We hear people
talk about encouraging coal production in
the Maritime Provinces and coalý shipments
from there, but the duty of 50 cents that we
impose in order to prevent coal coming in
by the St. Lawrence is handed back to those
people when they import slack coal to manufacture coke in the city of Hamilton.
Hon. Mr. DANDVRAND:
Can the honourable gentleman give us any reason to hope
that Cape Breton coal can ever reach Hamilton?
Hon. Mr. McCORMICK: I expressed not
only ny hope, but my conviction, as to what
would happen if certain things were donc.
If you can get the canals from Lachine up
to Lake Ontario deepened to 22 feet, I venture to say that in ten years you will have
all the bituminous coal you want hauled as
far as Toronto and Hamilton. And you need
not get that in from any present source of
supply; you can get it from an entirely new
field in the Island of Cape Breton, in the
county of Inverness. The Government of this
country have a line running up the shore,
through that district, and have the option of
buying it in two or three years. There is
in that district, as my honourable friend opposite is aware, as fine a seam of coal as
there is anywhere. with the exception of the
old Sydney. It is eight feet thick. There is
nothing legs than five feet in thickness. One
down at Broad Cove is fifteen feet thick,
and that, a coal operator told me the other
day, is one of the finest seams in the whole
Province of Nova Scotia. With terminals
at the Strait of Canso, with pockets such as
we have at Sydney and North Sydney, with
an arrangement for deliverv at these new
ports of entry, and with the deepening of
the canals to admit vessels of 4,000 or 5,000
tons, I say that in ten years there will be a
new source of supply; you will confer a great
benefit on the Maritime Provinces, especially
on the Island of Cape Breton; and at the
same time you will relieve Ontario of the
Hon.

Ir. McCORMICK.

menace of being frozen to death because of
an embargo on American coal during a strike.
These are only rambling remarks; but on
some other occasion I hope to bring before
the House several matters of a kindred nature.
I hope that the honourable leader of the
Government will take this question -into consideration and will make representations to
the powers that b, as to the discrimination
against the Maritime Provinces. Fish are admitted on the Pacifie coast, for consomption
in Canada, at one cent a pound. On the
other hand, if we send fish down to Portland
or Boston, the duty is two cents a pound. The
charge for bringing fish from the coast eastward to Winnipeg or Toronto is only half
of what is charged for bringing it from the
Atlantie. I draw this matter to the attention
of the Government and hope that something
can be donc to remove this discrimination.
I know that recently a slight reduction was
made from $2.12 to $2, on shipments to
Toronto: but still there is a heavy discrimination against the Maritime Provinces, and God
knovs we have enough trouble down there
without such discrimination.
Honourable
R. DANDURAND:
Hon.
gentlemen. there is one feature of the speech
we have just heard which surprises me considerably. My honourable friend cannot sec
why the Government proposes to retain the
Crowsnest Pass rates so far as they relate to
flour and wheat. I thought we were all agreed
upon giving favourable treatment to the West
when it came to the fixing of rates.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
to that.

I had no objection

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I am not
alluding to the speech of my honourable
friend from Manitoba, but to the one we
have just heard, which is in contradiction to
that of my honourable friend. I am quite
sure that no one from the Western Provinces
will rise to condemn the Government for
declaring at the outset that in the fixing of
rates an advantage should be given to the
wes t ern farmer because of the fact that he
is so far fron the seaboard.
Hon. Mr. McCORMICK:
Would the
honourable gentleman tell us why it is proposed to be done? What ground is there for
iU? What is the purpose?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Well, I am not
a railway man, and I have not studied transportation conditions; but I have some respect
for the general concensus of opinion throughout the land anong men who represent publie
opinion, and all agree that aome sacrifice

JUNE 9, 1925
should be ma;de by the cuntry as a whole
in favour of the great wheat îndustry which
we have in the West. I believe that pronounicements that have been made of a
political program by the Leader of the Coneervative Party include the recognition of the
principle that in the fixing of rates eomething should be done to help the Western
fariner. My honourable friend taices an
opposite view, but hie has flot raised hie voice
in condemnation of that part of the Order
in Council whîch -directs the Railway Commission ta review rates and examine into
them with a view of weighing the dlaims of
the Maritime Provinces made when they
came into Confederation. My honourable
friend condemns what hie thinks is an undue
favour ta the fariner of the West, but he
passes in silence over the point that the Railway Commission should seriously examme
jno the dlaims of the Maritime Provinces.
Now I go back to my honourable friend
froin Manitoba (Hon. 'MT. McMeans). He
has made a special appeal ta me ta hold out
Gome hope that the situation will improve
in Canada; lie wants ta know if economies
will be practiced, if our trade will be more
buoyant, if there is a hope of taxation being
reduced. I can only tell my honourable
friend that action is far more difficuIt than
criticisin, and t.hat he has supported Governments that have a record, so that hie muet
look with some sympathetic feeling ta those
wha have succeeded thein. I will give My
honourable friend the reasons for hope, and
will place before lim figures showing a dimninution of the expenditures of the country. The
total dishursements in 1921-22 were 3464,000,000; in 1922-23 they came down ta
$434,000,000; in 1923-24 ta 8370,000,000; and
in the last, fiscal year ta $350,000,000. From
this it will appear that during the last year
there was a reduction of 320,000,000 from the
preceding year, and a reduotion of $114,000,000
from the last year of the Conservative regime.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Does my honourable
friend take into consideration the railway
grant?
Han. Mr. DANDURAND: No. These are
the total disbursements appearing in the
Budget.
-Now, I will treat of the Canadian National
Railway. In 1920 the Canadian National
Railway showed a deficit over operating
expenses of $32,000,000; in 1921, a defleit of
311,000,000; in 1922 a surplus of $4,000,000;
in 1923 a surplus of 321,000,000; and in 1924,
due ta the short crop of last year, a surplus
of $17,00,000. The total deficits, after meetS-27

ing fixed charges, were: î %1920, 374,000,000;
in 1921, $72,000,000; in iâ22, 35,000,000; in
1923, 352,000,000; and in 1924, $54,000,000.
The moneys advanced ta the railways
during the past six years--that is, new moneys
-are as follows: During 1919-20, 3106,000,000;ý 192-21, $144,000,000; 1921-22, 3105,000,000; or a total for those .three years of $355,000,000 of expenditure.
The situation has
improved, during the lest three years. The
year 1922-23 shows an advance made of 359,000,000; 1923-24, of 385,000,000; 1924-25, of
876,000,0000; ar a total of $220,000,000, or a
decrease of 3135,000,000 from the preceding
three years.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Is that capital expenditure?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes. These are
the total advances made by the country ta
Canadian National Railway.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOTJGHEED: Does that
include securîties endorsed by the Caxadian
Governinent?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No, I would
Bay flot.
Naw, the dishursements per capita of the
population are as foliows: in 1922, 351.77;
1923, $47.50; in 1924, $39.36; in 1925, $37.51.
Froin this it will be apparent that there his
been a constant impravement during the last
three years. 0f course, I realize that the
process is a slow ane, but my honourable
friand must noýt farget -that the capital cost
af the war ta Canada was $1,760,000,000, and
that it was entirely financed by borrowed
money. Sa we have to-day under that head
$90,000,000 of interest ta pay. We find that
flot only was the war financed through borrowing, but that $413,000,000 were aiea borrowed
to meet ordinary deficits in the carrying out
of the business of the country; and in addition ta that we have been left with taxexempt bonds ta the amount of $1,544,924i350.
Now, I could run through thc charges that
were found by the present Government when
it came into office-fixed charges and uncontrollabie expenditure which must *be met.
Whatever savings we may have made under
other heads, there are obligations left which
must be met, and which came under the head
of uncontrollabie expenditurè. I need îlot
ment ion that at anc fell. swoop $74,000,000
were added by the cost of ithc Merchant
Marine, and 1 would s

the equity in the stock of the Canadian
National Railway. It bas not of course,
appreciated since then, but stili we must

pay the interest on that $10,000,000.

It is flot rny intention to detain the House
for hours in discussing the financial aspect
of the country. We know we cannot to a
very great extent reduce taxation, yet this
Goverament did reduce it, by tariff reductions, to, the extent of some $30,000,000 lust
year. I know that some members of this
Chamber will be apt to complain of the form
of the reduction; yet in the total we have
accomplished a reduction in the returns from
taxation, because, cali it protection or what
you will, the burden upon the sboulders of the
people was lightened to the extent of sorne
$30,000,000 last year.
Under the bead of trade, I think I can stili
give some consolation to rny honourable
friend. In the fiscal year 1920-21 trade imports exceeded -exporta by $30,000,000; in
1922-23 exporta exceeded imnports by 8142,000,000; in 1923-24 exporta exceeded importa by
$165,000,000; and last year, 1924-25, exporta
exceeded imports by $284,000,000. In 1920
our dollar was down to 80 cents; it is now at
par, and sometimes we see it at a little
premium in New York.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
The honourable
gentleman does not 'take credit for the exporta
exceeding the importa, because it is well
known that exports go out in the way of
unmanufactured natural resources, and corne
back as manufactured articles.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend is making a very sweeping staternent.
Last wveek he heard the honourable gentleman from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien)
state that our industries were producing more
than our farms. But this general staternent
means very little. One only needs to open
the blue'books to Elnd what is the suým tortal
oour exports, and 1 believe on that head
again mv honourable friend should receive
some consolation.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: To be fair, the
honourable gentleman from Montarville referred to the production of the country, but
what my bonourable friend takes is the exports.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, the honourable gentleman from Montarville spoke of
production; but what bas been done with that
production? It appears in the bluebook: It
bas gone out of the country. 0f course, we
must retain what is necessary for domestie
consurnption; but rny honourable friend only
needs to refer to the bluebook to flnd out
Hon.

Mr.

DAN!DURAND.

what that surplus of exporta over importa,
arnounting to $284,000,000, is mnade up of, and
he will flnd that our manufacturera have done
fairly well in the outside marketa.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: But the point of
the honourable member from Manitoba (Hon.
Mr. MeMeans) is that the bulk of that is not
rnanufactured goods, but raw producta.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But my honourable friend will ýconceive that we receive
some raw products in return. Take the coal
that cornes from the other aide of the border,
and the raw cotton that cornes to, our textile industry. If he will look through the
list he will find that we have a considerable
imnport of raw materials.
Now, with these few rernarks, whicb have
covered the firat part of the question of my
honourable friend, I desire to, answer the
latter part, namely:
And to inquire of the Government if it intends to
change its fiscal policy this Session.

The answer to that is an em.phatic no, 'because the Governrnent realizes that this country needs, above alI, stability in its administration of the customs. Stability does not
mean immobility; but our manufacturera are
entitled to know for somne tirne lapon what they
must figure, what conditions they must face.
Wben 1 look at the situation throughout Canada as reflected by the opinion given at the last
electoral consultation, and maintained to this
day in the popular bT-use, I believe that the
present Budget is a weýll-balanced budget;
not one that bas been considerably meddled
with, but one that bas been made with a
view to, reducing the coat of raw materials and
the implements of production in order to,
lighten the burden of taxation on the people.
On that score we have made a sacrifice of
530,000,000 of income. This is a very difficoît
country to administer, as we ail know. We
see it in the various groupa that have been
elected on certain programs. But I believe
that the vast ma.iority of the manufacturera
of this country are aýbsolutely indifferent to
the tariff situation, satisfled witb it, doing
well under it, minding their own business, and
plodding and working day by day and year by
year. It is very seldorn that we hear a complaint from them, apart from the woollen manufacturera, who dlaim that importation, flot
from the United States, but from Great
BritainHon. Mr. GORDON: Is not the honourable leader jollying us a little on this point?
What about one of the industries in bis own,
Province-the boot and sboe business-

JUNE 9, 1925
Han. Mr. DANDURAND:
I arn not
through.
Hou. Mr. GORDON: Yeu will corne to
that?
Han. Mr. DANDURAND:
Oh, ye.
Hon. Mr. GORDON:- It appears ta me,
from the way you are talking about the manufacturera being satisfied, that~you are really
jollying us, because every person knows that
the manufacturera ail over the country taday are dissatisfied.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I know manufacturera who, if I went ta them. a.nd aaked
them if they wanted an increase in tariff, would
say no.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: What business are
they in?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In a prosperous
business, as most of the businesses of Canada
are.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Boot and shoe?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: One of the late
Presidents of the Boot and Shoe Manufacturers Association bas stated, publicly that,
during the firet years after the war, responding
to the buoyancy of the market, Vhey had loet
their heade and increased manufaoturing, added
wings to their factories and worked over
night, because of the then demand for boots
and shoes t.hroughout the world; but that,
when normal conditions reappeared in most
countries of the woËld, they found themnselves
with plant enough to make three or four times
what their old clientèle before the war would
have consumed. Naturally
weak' ones,
who had stocks on hand and the little credit,
but
feit the need of disposing -of those stocks at
any cost, and in that processa many went to
the wal'l. The stronger onea resisted and
survived. That is but the ordinary readjustment of conditions after such an upheaval se
wrc have had.
There is a amaîl increase ini importa fromr
Great Britain, a large proportion of those
importa taking advantage of the water route
and coming through the Panama Canal to
the Pacifie Coast; but there is a corresponding
reduction in importa from the United States.
When I consider the saal proportion of
importa as compared with the total value of
boots and choes used in Canada, I feel that
we ought to think twice before increasing the
price that familïes have to pay. for th.ee
neceasities. We have ta remenmber the consumer.

Hon. Mr. GORDON: ls that donseat the
cost of driving aIl those people out of the
province of Quebec, which supplies moet of
the boota and ahoes made in Canada?
Hon. Mr. DANDTJRAND: It la flot, If
my honourable friend will go down to the
boot and, ehoe manufacturing centres of Quebec
and M'ontreal and will atudy the situation,
he will find that the men who have been
cautiaus, and the men who have enough
capital ta afford to be imprudent, are holding
their own. Of course, they muet adjuat themselves ta new conditions. The atatement
which I observed and quoted, a year or two
ago, from the President of the Manufacturera
Association, went ta show that there had
been an increased 'production in a downward
market. Those conditions must be readjuated.
As ta woollens, I would aak those who are
so much interested in Canadian production
that when they enter a store ta make a
purchase they will give preference to Canadianmade woolens and will flot, like most of the
honourable gentlemen who aurround me, and
like myself, buy British goods.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: What about the
tann-ing industry? la it also prooperous?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
That comea
very close ta boot and ahoea manufacture.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: On the whole,
knowing the difficulties encountered by aur
friends in the Maritime Provinces, and knowing the situation in the Western provinces,
I feel that we muet be discreet in these
times and that in a middle course we shal]
find a correct solution for aur presen-t
difficulties.
Han. Mr. GORDON: What about ail those
factories that are going out o«fbusiness?
Hon. Mr. DANDTJRAND:
There are
always factories gaing ont of business. My
honourable friend knowa why they do. It ia
sametimes through inexperience, sometimea
because of lack of capital, and at other
times because of abaolntely bad management.

APPOINTMENT 0F SENATE OFFICIAIS
FURTHER DISCUSSION

The Senate resumed from June 4 thie ad.
journed debate on the motion of Hon. Mr
Daniel:
That, in the opinion of thse Senate, thse appointisent
of ail officers occupying seats on the fSoor of the Senate,
to whom the Civil Service Act applies, should be
selected and appointed. by the Senate, and that the
Civil Service Commission should be asked to exelude
those positions f rom the operation of the Civil Service
Act.

Hon. J. H. FISHIER: Honourable igentlemen, in moving the adjotirnment of the debate, I clid not do so with the ideia of discussing
this question any further, but simply for the
purpose of mnov.ing an amenilment which
would bring from the membors of the Senate
an expression of opinion as to whether or not,
ail a.ppointments of officiais on the floor ol
the Senate should be made by the Sonate
itself. I have made my amendrnent as short
and plain as possible, an~d I think it should
receive the support of every imember of the
Sonate. However, whatever the outcome may
ho, I ccrtainiy think that the members of this
body should have an opportuni.ty of pýlacing
themselves on record on this question. 1 therefore beýg to move in ameudment, seconded by
Hon. Mr. Smith:
That, in thse opinion of the Senate, ail ofllcers occupying seats on thse floor of the Senate should be seiected
and appointed by the Senate.

Honourabli
Hon. M.r. DANDURAND:
gentlemen, I amn inclined to join with my
honourable friend the ýmover of the motion
(Hon. Mr. Daniel) and the mover of the
amenilment (Hon. Mr. Fisher) as to the propriety of the Sonate having something to say
in the seleetion of the high officers with whom
icornes in contact d>aily. That, I take it for
granted, is the view which is held by ail. My
only difflculty is as to th.e fitness of oxpressing
tha-t desire when we are faced *by a question
of law.

JUNE 9, 1925
We ail know th-at the Ci-vil Service Commission has released the position of the Blach
Rod, and that the condition attadhed is that
the law officers of the Crown shall proinoume
as ta the authority which will make the appointaient. I dishike entering into the field
when the matter is sub irudice. I.have not
approached the law offloars of the Crawn, and
I arn sure that they have been a.pproached,
only by the dklegate of the Senste, so to,
speak, namely, the law offices' of the Senate.
Before com-ing inito this C4hamber et 3 o'clock
thîis aftarnoon I thought it was my duty to
inquire as to the situation at the moment,
and I was informed. that no written statement
had been received at thiat time by the Lams
Clerk.
The onfly matter that I arn not sure about
is the opportuneness of adopting this rescslution in the face of the resolution cf the
Senate of Canada of 1867, which deolared that
the Black Rod was an appointament of the
Cro-wn. At. first, as I have ha-d ccasion Vo,
say, my opinion was, wýthout having read the
text of that réesolution, that the Senate had
proceeded on the lina of the devolution of
p.ower; but, when I read the tit, to my su*prise 1 found that it was a recognition of
poweir vested in the Crown. We are face Vo
face with the resuit olf the Sanate reoognizing
-1 .think< that i8 the expression to ha found
in the resolution-that the appointment of
the Black Rod belongs to the Crown. We will
now déclare:
That, in the opinionf of the Senate, ail officers occupying seats on the floor of the Senate should be selected
and appointed by the Sexiste.

I have no objection to that expression of
opinion. ,I do flot know what will ba the
view taken by the King in Council-because
I suppose when we speak of the Crown we
mean the King in Couneil-or what will ha
its opinion if the law officers of the Crown
declare that the appointmnent belongs to the
King in Coundil, or Vo the Crown. However,
we naed not face that situation, as it is flot
now before us. Ail that there is, is Vhe resolution and the ameudment, and I do flot
intend to express any opinion contrary Vo the
wish of honourable gentlemen, ha it pious or
otherwise.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUOHEED: As my
honourable friend does not propose to oppose
the motion, I arn only going Vo occupy the
time of the House Vo say. that if thie Senate
has any opinion Vo, voice upon the subjeet,
this 18 the time to do it. This is Vhe only
opportune time we shall have, because section
38B of Chapter 22 of the Statutes of 1921
provides as follows:

421

In any case where the Commission decides that it in
flot practicable nor in the publie interest to applY this
Act to any position or positions, the Commission maY,
with the approval. of the Governor in Council, exclude
such position or positions li whole or in part f rom, the
operation of the Act, and maire such regulations as are
decmbed advisable prescribing how such position or
positions are to be desit with.

1 undarstand that in the order made by
the Commission thare was an absence of any
statement as to the manner in which the position should ha filled; so it is clear that the
Commission has not performed the whole of
its duty.
They believe
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
they hava, by raferring it Vo, the law offlcats
of the Crown.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
noV a regulation as to how the appointmnent
shall ha madaý: it is simply a suggestion Vo
avade the responsibility which. fails upon them.
To make a valid order they must state in
the ordar how the position is to, ha filled. This
resolution is simiply an expression of opinion
by this House as to filling it ourselves.
Soma Hon. SENATORS: Carried.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Would the hionourable gentleman from. Nipissing (Hon. Mr.
Gardon) take the Chair?
Hon. Mr. Gordon in the Chair.
Hon. Mr. BO8TO'CK: As neither of the
leaders has pointed out to the House the
differenca hetween the amandment and the
original motion, perhaps it would ha well,
before the House expresses an opinion, Vo
point out the affect of the amendment. The
motion as first prasented to the House by the
honourable gentleman from St. John (Hon.
Mr. Daniel) provided for an expression of
opinion of the Senate on the matter, leaving
out the Clark, as it was especially provided
at the tîme the Civil Service Act was put
into effeet that the Clark should ha. appointed
by the Government of the day. The motion
as made hy the honourable gentleman signified 'that the floor officers, with the exception of tha Clark, should ha appointed by
the Senata; but the amendiment of the honourabla gentleman from. Brant (Hon. Mr.
Fisher) would express the opinion that the
appointment of the Clark should ha made by
the Sanate.
I did noV know whathar the House exactiy
understood. that. If that is the opinion that
honourable gentleman désire Vo express, ail
right.
]Ton. Mr. DANIEL: Do I understand that

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
point out that the motion canoot toiîch the
Clerk of the House, because he does nlot corne
under the Civil Service Act. Therefore At
could not he applied in that way. TPhe resolution can only have in vicw the appointrnent
of officers at present appointed by the Civil
Service Commission.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: But the amendm3ýnt
says "that in the opinion of the Senate ail

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
ipresuppa.ses that the appaintinent reste with
the Civil Service Commission, and it cannot
contemplate the inclusion of the Clerk.
Hon. .Mr. BOSTOCK: I think it is too
sweeping and general.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If it is
desirable, we can say "with the exception of
the Clerk of the House". I would suggest that
to the maver.
Hon. Mr. FISHER- I arn very willing
indeed to make that change.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Or perhaps it would
be better just ta insert; in Vhe amendrnent the
words that appeared ini the original motion:
"Vo whoma the Civil Service Act applies".
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That

Hon. Mr. POIRIER (Translation): It is
unnecessary ta explain at any length the wish
that I express, that the avenues, roadways and
walks leading ta Parliament may be sa constructed as ta harmonize with the magnificent
Parliament Buildings that are on the eve of
compietion.
The generai effeet gives the
impression of a man admirably dressed, whose
shoes are neglected and down at the heels.
I'hat should flot be: it is ixot fitting. I
fancy that the Go'vernment will attend ta the
matter, but I deem it my duty to point out
ta the honourable leader of the Government
in this House thie rather disgraceful condition,
and I trust fhe will caîl1 it to the attention of
the Minîster of Publie Works, and that what
cannot be done at present wili have been done
by the time we return here next Session.
Hon. Mr. DANDURANI (Translation): I
may tell the honourable Senator that his wish
is already oonmpled with. I have taken up the
matter with the Minister of Publie Worke, who
lias given me explanations whinh aatisfy me
and wi'll also, 1 trust, satisfy the honourable
Senator from Shediac.
The Minister of
Public Works informs me that the sidewalks
andi roadways around the Parliament Buildings
are being reconatructed and wili sean be finished. As ta the walks and roadways leading
from Wellington street, they will be done
when the Parliament Tower is completed. I
hope that when we returu here next Spring we

IMPORTATION 0F "ROCK LOBSTER"
INQUIRY

Hon. JOHN McLEAN rose in accordance
witb the folloýwing notice:
Tisat ise will cail tise attention of tise Senate and
rnquire of the Governmient as follows:
1. s -tise Department of Customs and Excise aware
that crayfish in tin containers 'is being inported into
i Canada labelled as "Rock
Canada, and sold
Lobster," thereby unfairly conipeting with thse lobster
packing business i Canada?
2. la it permnissible to imiport sucis fieh under the
namne of "Rock Lobster"?
3. ls tise Departnient of Fisheries sware of thse
mattera aibeve stated, and if so, whst measures doas
thse Depairtgnent àntend to take to protect, the lobster
packing business of Cansda?

He said: Honourable gentlemen, the lobster
business, as ail members of the Senate know,
is a very important one in the Maritime Provinces, there being something like 120 factories that employ on an average about 40
people.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL:

You mean 40 persons

in eacb factory?

lIon. Mr. McLEAN: Yes. Those rock
lobsters are caught in British Honduras , and
are packed in New Jersey. If tbey were lieing packed bere, and sent to the United States,
wbatever name tbey miglit go under, there
would be scientists wanting to know whetber
tbey were imported under tbeir proper name.
At the same time, may I bring another
malter to the attention of the Government?
Since the Americans put the duty of 2 cents a
pound on fish of ail kinds, Bank fishermen
have not been allowed to take their flsb to
Gloucester or Boston without transferring tbern
to American vessels. At the -same time, the
Gloucester fishermen-I refer to the Gordon
Pugh Company-send a large vessel down
every spring with a cargo of saIt, whicb, as
the leader of the Government knows, is admitted to !Canada free for flsbing purposes,
and it is distributed around at different pl aces
wbere codýflsb are put up. Local men are
emp]oyed to fisb for tbe codflsh, and in the fal
cf the year the fisb are taken up by this Company, who are not required to ýget a consul's
certificate, and these fish, cauglit by British
subjects wîthin the tbree-mile limît, enter
the United States, I believe, free ofduy
I do not know wbether or not the Governmet
is aware that tbis is going on, but it is a
ma'ter that I tbink I should bring to their
attention. It is very unfair, because we cannot slip the flsh to the United States without
a consul's certificate stating ihe value and Sa
forth, wbile ail that these other people have
to do is to report their vessels.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

tborougbly familiar with the matter, but tbat

SMUGGLING ON THE CANADIAN
BORDER
INQUIRY

Honourable
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON:
gentlemen. may 1 cali the attention of the
leader of the Government te the fact that on
March 1lth last there was under discussion
in this House a resolution of approval of a
Treaty the ahi eet of whieh was to suppress
smuggling between Canada and the United
States. Some discussion took place, and my
honourabie friend intimated to the flouse that
if the resolution were permitted ta pass be
would bring the matter te the attention of
the Customs Departament and would endeavour to get the information which I tbink
the flouse desired, namnely, as to the limitation to be put upon the size of oceangoing vessels so called, wbich were to be given
clearance papers for the export of liquor.
1 cal attention to this matter again, partieularly because of the fact that certain unpleasant incidents are oceurring in the Niagara
Peninsula wbich I have the honour of representing in this flouse; and also, ta intimate
to my honourable friend that 1 arn sure, from
knowledge received, that an investigation of
the matter would reveal the fact that Customs
officers are to-day issuing clearance papers
to ordiinary row-boats on the. Detriot river
and, I fancy, on the Niagara river, and that, if
they can get across the river, well and good,
but, if not, that they land on the Canadian
side and dispose of their cargoes of liquor.
On the Niagara frontier a seriaus situation
has arisen, and I will read from the Toronto
Star of June 5 a news dispateli from Buffalo,
which is headed: "American drys ail worked
up over our laxity-Claims Canadian men
deliberately winking at rum-smuggling." The
article goes on to say:
The attitude of Canadien "pro-liquor officiais- was
responsible for the esabishment of a larger federal
dry guard along the Niagara frontier, it wau disclosed
to-day by Collector of Custorms Bradley, and United
States Attorney Tenipleton.
District Attorney Texupleton wau etrong agninst the
Canadien politiciens. «'The United States governnient
la tired of tItis trifling attitude of the Canadien
politiciens," he eaid. "When Canada and Canadiens
learn that we don't need anything that they've got
over there, from their bluff beer to the garden truck
that'a peddled here along thie border, they'll discover
how important it is and profitable it anay beconie to
try a littie co-operetion with the police laws of a
neigbbour nation. 7te attitude of thie autiiorities acosB

disrespeot for the publie opinion of the United States,
lsabeIout s ddagusting as this alieged 2.2 beer with
which the samne indîvidualis are tiying to obtain gond
American inoney."

I cail my honourable, friend's attention to
the fact, because I know that a substantial
portion of our population of respectable cîti-

426

SENATE

zens in the Niagara district have been more
or less worked up for some time over the
liquor smuggling that has been going on and
the characters engaged in that business who
corne into the icommunity. It has even
occurred that people are afraid to go on the
public highways at nlight because of highspeed motors, which are supposed to be engaged in this business, rushing through the
country at a very rapid rate without regard
f0 other people whýo may lie on the highways.
I arn sure that an investigation wilI prove
it to lie true that the restriction whic.h this
House asked to be put in that resolution,
namely, thaf there should be a reasonable
limit put upon the tonnage -of a boat that
was given clearance papers to carry liquor, is
nof being complied with, and that every kind
of boat, even an ordinary row-boat, is receiving papers for that purpose. This pracfiee, in my humble opinion, affords justification for the criticism of American officiais on
our operation.
Hon. Mr. DANDUR'AND:
What is the
date of the resolution- to whieh my honourable friend refera?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Mareh il. My
honourable friend's words, at the conclusion
of the debafe, were:

by one of his colleagues, andi the latter may

very much importance to the sligbting remarks that appear in the American press on
fthe border.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: But I would
remind rny honourable friend that this is the
Toront o press, the Toronto Star.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But was it not
a reproduction of what was being said in
Buffalo?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No; if was apparently a special correspondent of the Star
in Buffalo who sent that diapatch to the
Toronfo paper.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
On the whole.

of society on the other aide; and I know that

NIPISSINO CENTRAL RAILWAY
INQIYIRY

On the Orders of the D)ay:
Hon. Mr. GORDON: With the leave of
the Hause, I would like ta caîl the attention
of the hanourable Leader ta a matter of
great importance ta the country at large.
Some two yeara ago I had the honour of
introducing a Bill for extending the Nipiusing
Central Railway acrose the northern, portion
o! Ontario and Ithrough the province of Quebec. I may say that that railway is a suhsidiary o! the Tirniskarning and Northern
Ontario Railýway, which is controlled by the
Ontario Governrnent. That campany started
ta build a railway, and had completed it

practically through Ontario ta the border, but
they have been met there by the province of
Quebec pUtting up a sign: IlThou shait flot
go any further." To-day that line is being
held up notwithstanding the fact that the
cornpany had a charter from the Parliament
of Canada ta build it, and that they have
aiready on the ground in the province of
Quebec the supplies necessary for building the
road, which could only be put in there during the winter months. If the building of this
road is stopped now it will mean a considerable loss ta that Companxy. I would like ta
ask the leader of the Government what represen'tations have been made ta the Government by the Province of Quebec in regard
ta stopping the building of this road.
Hon. iMr. DANDIJRAIND: I wouild augget

be juâtified in bringing the papers down. 1 amn

undier our federal aystem 'the provinces are

CONDITIONS 0F DIVORCE BILL
MOTION

FOR SECOND

READING

Hýon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY *moved the
second reading of Bill 4, an Act respecting
Divorce.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the subjFet-mat.ter of (this NiU is very simple, yet it
involves a very importa-nt principle. The Bill
,vas introduced in another place hy a priývate
member, and after considerable discussion, and
the rejection oif amendments ta the Bill, it
finaldy .passed by a large majority. kt has been
placed in my hands, doubtless by virtue of
my capacity as Chairman of the Co'mmittee
on Divorce, and Il bring it before this Chamber
in the hope that you may give -it favourable
consideration.
The change that it makes in the exlsting
law is ne>t very istriking, yet to those who
have not given attention to matters of divorce
it may not be uninteresting, for at least a few
mnoments, in any event. to tell yen what is
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

the present ]aw in Canada, and how it came
to be the law.
We aIl know that in, this Chamber the
woman is regardeil as on an exaot equality
with the man .in ob-taining divorce. That ils
sa alsn in the Maritime Provinces. In Prince
Edward Island divorces applied for may be
granted by the Provincial Council; that is,
by the flovernor in Council. In t.he other two
Maritime Provinces. Nova Scotia and

New

Brunswick. there are regular Divorce Courts.
Li those provinces by -the sea the woman is
placed on the samne level as the -man, and may
obtain a divorce on the same grounds.
,In Ont.ario and Quebec. as we aIl know,

there ýis ne divorce îlegislation.

Every

Bill

paissed in thýis House is a separate and àldi-

vidual A-et of Divorce.
May I digress for a moment to allude to a
certain Canradian leg-al publicist who, on -many
occasions. and in very unwarranted and striking language, hias impeached the legal and
constitutional authority of the ParL.ament of
Canada to grant 'divorce? I refer to this only
ir passing, because of articles that !have been
contributed by thait genflemen tothe public

press of Canada.

On more than one occasion

gentlemen hav e complained t0 me and have
asked. "What is the answer?" WeIl, I a.m not

going to deýbate that question. It is. I ýthink.
obvinus to this Bouse and -ta Parlianent that
we have not continued since Cenfederat-ion ta
exercise the righit of grantin-g divorce without
havý,inig absolute legal authority to do so, and
I think ît would be derogatory ta the di.gnity

of Parliament
men.t in th.is
simply saying
since the first

flor me to enter inýto cany argurespect. I content myself by
this: From Confederation, ever
divorce was granrted, the very
best legel minds ini the House have always
been directed ta the question of divorce. We
have had in both Chambers a large number
of gentlemen who. through their religious
tenets, are opposed entireiy to d.ivorce, and it
would be an insult f0 the intelligence of these
gentlemen ta think that they had sat mute
and not protested a-gainsf the exercise 'by tItis
Parliament of power that it did not possess
Se much for that, in :passing.
In Western Canada, that às, Manitoba, Saskat.chewan, Alberta and British Columbia, the
woman and the man are not placed on fermis
of equality in obitaining divorce. What diýsadvantages is the wojman under in the Prairie
Provinces? In the law as if was firet e'nacted
in England to establish a Divorce Courtthat is, the rDivorce and Matrimonial Causes
Act, Chapter 85, of 1857--Section 27 set out
the -groundls on whiiob divorce could be applied
for. With your permission I will read it. It

of Raqe, or of Sodomy or Betiality, or of Aditery
coupled with sunob Cruelty as without Adultery would
have entitled her to a Divorce a Mensa et Thora, or of
AduLtery coupled witih Desertion, without reasonable
Excuse, for Two years or upwards.

Only two portions of that enabling section dealing with the woman, are of any
practical importance. The cases of 'bigamy
with adultery, or incestuous adultery, or rape,
or sodomy, or bestiality, are extremely rare.
Applications ba.sed on adultery coupled with
cruelty are quite common in Western Canada, as they were in England before the
legal change to which I shaîl refer; and adultery coupiled with desertion without legal
or reasonable excuse, for two ycars, was comparatively frequent.
I have pointed out what is in actual practice
the difference 'hetween the rights of the man
and those of the woman. A mere isolated
case of adultery, uncondoned and committed
without connivance, etc., entities the man to
a divorce, but in the case of the wornan, in
practically ail instances that corne before the
Court, there must be adul'ery coupled with
cruelty or with deserticn for two years without lawful excuse.
How did that corne to be the iaw in Canada? It may not be uninteresting to discuss
this class of legisiation for a few moments for
the benafit of honourable members who have
flot had their attention directed to it. In
England up till ý1857 divorces w.ere heard,
as we know, by the Huse of Lords. The
proceedings leading up to such divorces were
extremely expensive. Litigation had to be
taken first in the common law courts and a
judgment given and execution obtained and
satisfied, and there had to be a prosecution
as against the co-respondent, and many other
things had to be done before the application
could actually be made to the bouse of Lords.
Ail this procedure was found to be inordinatëly
expensive, and it was considered that it denied
a remedy to those who believed in divorce
for proper cause. The result was that the
Engiish Parliament in 1857 passed the Act
of which I have cited a section, and which is
still the law of England, save as modified to
some extent by later enactments.
In Ontario and Quebec we had no divorce
1egisiation at ahl on the Statute Book at the

429

time of Confederation, and as we have not
legislated generally on divorce in the Federal
Parliament, it has been necessary for people
from Ontario and Quebec to corne here to
obtain divorce. In- the Maritime Provinces
they had divorce courts before Confederation,
and as you will remember, the Act of Confederation continued the laws then in force
and applicable in the various Provinces of
Canada that-icined in 'Confederation.
In Manitoba, from July 1870, we had the
laws as they were in England, as far as they
were applicable toi the conditions of our life.
By the Northwest Territoriee Act of 1885, it
was deolared that the law of England as it
stood on the 15th of Juiy, 1870, shouid be
the law in force in tihe Northwest Territories
s0 far as it was applicable, and as under the
British North America Act divorce was the
peculiar prerogative of the Parliament of
Canada, therefore the law of Bngland as it
stood in 1857 became the iaw ipso facto of
Saskatchewan and Alberta. British Columbia
came into Confedieration in 1871, and the
women of British Columbia are in the same
position as are the women of the three Prairie
Provinces.
That accounts for the fact that the woman
of western Canada is not on an equaiity with
the woman of eastern Canada. It was thought
in the three Prairie Provinces for a very
long time that nobody had the right to go
to the courts for a divorce at all, but an
adventurous lîtigant in very recent years had
a case carried to Engiand, and it was decided
hy the Privy Council that the divorce law
of Engiand, as I have read it, was in force
in the Prairie Provinces. It thereupon became necessary to organize provincial courts
and to make miles and regulations governing
the granting of divorce. Therefore we have
the disparity which exists at the present time.
This Charnber, however, I think with a proper
appreciation of the constantly improving position of woman in socie-ty, accordcd her an
equaiity with man as to, the grounds for
divorce. I think it is a tribute to this bouse,
which is sometimes said not to be responsive
to the public wiil, that it was the pioneer so
far as actual legisIation is concerned in granting women an equaiity with men.
Ahl that this Bill seeks to do is to put the
women of Western Canada on an equaiity
with the men, It is true that the women of
Western Canada could corne to the Senate
Divorce Committee, and could obtain a
divorce here upon proper cause being shown.
Our ruies at present provide that the applications must be made in person, and that
the witnesses must appear personally before

rather desiraible mile, and it lias a tendency
to restriet the number of applications. The
resuit is that in the last two years--I speak
without checking the accuracy of the statement-we have flot had applications from
those actually resident in the Prairie Provinces, aithougli we have had applications from
people who had resided in the West but who
had corne East to reside.
The English Parliament has moved along
in the direction in which we ask this House
to move. There is a very elaborate and most
interesting report on divorce which was made
by an English Commission. Some years ago
I took the liberty of discussing that report
in this Chamber at some considerable lengtli.
The Commission was appointed in 1912, and
represented every phase of English societyboth sides of polities were represented,
aithougli the Commission was not political
in any sense-and minority and a majority
reports were made by the Commission which
wvas presided over by Mr. Gorreil Barnes,
afterwards Lord Gorreli, a gentleman who
has had an enermous experience in matters
cf divorce. Certain cf the recommendations
contained in the majority report were acceded
te in the minerity report. These had to do
with the extending of the grounds cf divorce.
but net in such a way as te be offensive te
anybody. 1 only mention that in passing.
The recommendation was made that the
woman and the man should be placed on
equal terrms, and it is somewha.t astonishing
te find that that is the main recommendation
in the majority report which was acceded te
in the minority report. The Archabishop of
York was one of those who signed the minerity report, lie and lis two colleagues Who
signeil tlie report with him cencurring in
placing the man and the woman on an equality. No Bill bas ever passed the British Parliament bringing into effect tlie termis as a
whole cf either the majority or the minority
repert. An attempt was made in 1921 to
pass sucli legislation as we are new seeking.
That attempt was net successful. In 1923,
however, a Bill was passed by the British
Parliament which is four square with tlie Bill
now before you for consideration. That Bill
passed the House of Commons witli a tremendous majority, and went te the House
of Lords, wliere is was introduced by Lord
Buckmaster and was supported by Lord
Birkenhead, a member of tlie Government,
and while some who did not believe in
divorce under any circumstances dissented from
it, it passed that bouse witli an enormous
majonity, and it is now the law of England.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

Now, just a word as te the law whicli
distinguishes between the riglits of the man
and the riglits of tlie woman. Tlie woman lias
got to prove cruelty. One miglit think that
was a comparatively easy tliing te do; but
I may fell you that cruelty is one ef the
most difficult things for a wif e te prove against
hier husband in a divorce court. I amn net
geing te cite a lot of decisions, but 1 should
like te refer te one which has been placed in
my hands, and which I have taken the trouble
te verify. It is a decision of the Appellate
Court of Ontario, and shows what is meant by
cruelty. It says:
To establish cruelty, one must dhow tretment likely
te preduce, or which qproduces physical illness or
mental distress of a nature calculated per!manently to
affect her bodily health or endanger her reason, and
that there ia reesonayle apprebension thiat the same
state of 4hiags will continue.

Everv practising

cruelty in a divorce court bas found that it is
extreniely difflcult te prove.
bon. Mn. BELCOURT: Was that a dccisien in an aiimeny action from wliich the
honourable gentleman read?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Yes. 0f course,
there is ne divorce court in Ontario. But I
have the case cf Rus~sell vs. Russell, in which
the rule laid down in the Ontario court has
been followed. It has been fullexved in the
ceurts ef Alberta and Saskatchewan.
The othen ground, desertion for twvo years
wiîthout re:îsonable excuse, looks on the face
of if te be an extremely simple thing te
prove. It is by ne aneans as dificuit ýte
establisha as legal cruelty, but at times it bas
proved te be net a very easy thing te
establish. The British Parliament passcd legislation in 1884, 1 think, making it more easy
fer the weman te establisli desertion. It is
proposed, therefore, by this Bill te sweep away
the inequalities, and te, place a woman on
an equality with a man in coming befone the
courts in an application for a divorce.
The Divorce Committee, of whieh I temporarily have the honour te lie Chairman,

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: There is an

Hon. THOMAS CHAPAIS: Honourable
gentlemen, I arn sure that none of my colleagues wi]l be surprised if I rise to oppose
this Bill. I arn against it because I arn
agairnat divorce, utterly and absolutely.
To my mind, divorce is a great social evil.
Vor centuries after the advent of Christianity, it was flot ta be found among the laws of
any Christian nation. The indissolubility of the
marriage tie was an undîsputed principle. Unfortunately, in modern times, with the weakening of the religious spirit, and under the
pressure of interest and passion, divorce began its steady march towards universal recognition by governments and parliarnents. This
was not a forward, it was a backward progression. It was a retrogression ta paganisrn.
It was a deadiy blow ta the Christian conception of marriage and to the stabihlity of the
family. No better dissolvent of those fundamental institutions could be devised. Divorce
is the ýmast alluring premium ta unfaithfulness
and to the violation of the solemn vows subscribed at the foot of the altar. It is undoubtedly conducive ta decreased natality. It
is a mcst powerful agent of wretched education, whereby unfortunate children, mercilessly torm between coriflicting influences and
grievously tossed through belligerent dlaims,
are cheated of that noble dualisin of love, of
solicitude, of wise direction, frorn that paternal
and maternai holy co-operation, which are the
safest means of instilling morality and rightfulness in the heart of growing generations,
and the best pledge of future greatness for a
nation. To use the wÔrds of Theodore Roosevelt, "Divorce is a bane for a nation, a curse
an society, and a menace to the home." And
that menace is ever growing and getting new
momenturn.
The statistics on th-at subject are ominously
illuminating.
In England, the number of
decrees niai <for divorce) made absolute during the year 1921 was 3,464, as against 1,654
i*n 1919 and 577 in 1913. The registrar general1
of birth, deatha and marriages in his report
for 1919 stated that "the number of divorces

431

ohtained in 1919 was about 50 per cent greater
than in 1918, wbich was itself the highest up
ta that date, and with the increase of divorces
there bas been a corresponding increase in the
number of persans who on re-marriage de*scribed. tihemselves as divorced."
In the United States the courts are flooded
with divorce cases. In 1922, a total of 148.554 was reacbed. Some years ago an investigation was said ta show that in the states of
Oregon and Washington, during a six monýths
period, the ratio was one divorce in every
two marriages. It was such a state of things
whîich made a well-known divine of New York,
Dr. William T. Manning, declare "that the
present system of easy divorce in the United
States was in some respects iess moral than
the system, of polygamy."
I do flot want ta take up the time of the
Senato with a wearisome array of figures. Let
me only say a word about the situation in
France, as ta the disruption of matrimonial
bonds. The latest statistics available show
that in 1922, 33,000 divorces were granted
in that country, as against 11,657 in 1919, an
increase of aimost two-thirds.
Alas, aur own statistics establish that Canada has entered the list and is strenuously
endeavouring ta emulate the cauntries where
easy divorce is striving ta lower the social
standard. In aur Dominion, during the year
1918, 90 divorces were granted. Four years
later, in 1922, this figure had been increased ta
544. Speaking anly of "relief" granted by
Parliament, during the last ten years, the
number of divorces bas grown from 33 in
1914 ta 117 in 1923. Are flot those figures
alarming enough ta justify a repetition of the
aid Roman saying: "Caveant consules!"
Divorce is the curse of Europe; it is the
curse of England; it is the curse of the United
States; it is fast becoming the curse of Canada. And allow me ta add that it is the
special curse of the Canadian Senate.
With such a conviction and such a feeling.
I say how could we accept a bill whose
acknowledged aim is ta give divorce new facilities, is ta enlarge its sphere and ta widen its
scope? It cannot but increase the already too
fast increasing number of broken homes and
disrupted families. This is evidence itself.
If you enact that such a deed, heretofore not
recognized as a just cause of divorce, shahl
henceforth be accepted as Iegally warranting
a divorce decee, at once you open the door
ta numberless cases where the sacredness of
marriage shall be assailed, and the social
efficiency of the matrimonial bond shail be
destroyed. A new means of securing divorce
cannot possibly have any result other than a

SENATE

432

marked increase in the number of divorces.
Such has been the case in England since the
passing of the law enabling the English
women to claim a divorce on account of the
adultery of the husband. Allow me to quote
a cable from London, dated 25th April, 1924:
A striking feature of the forthcoming law term here
is the large nunber of divorce suite brought by wives
under the new Act which gives women equal rights
with men in the matter of ground for divorce, namely,
proof of misconduct. There are nearly 600 undefended
divorce suits entered on the court lists.

But the supporters of this Bill bring forth
what they deem to be an unanswerable argument. They say: "We are fighting for justi-e. We strive to wipe away a shameful discrimination between woman and man. To the
present day, man alone in Canada may ask
for a divorce on the sole ground of the consort's adultery. The woman is refused that
meIns of relief, and is dobarred from obtaining a divorce decree on the single plea of the
husband's adultery. This is unfair. Let us
enact equality between the tiwo sexes. Let
us give them equal facility of attaining that
noble goal. the right of repudiating the most
solemn of human bonds."
Such a plea may be deemed plausible at
first sight. It has even entrapped some sincere
on)noents of divorce. Still it is nothing else
than wretched sophistry. If the power of
ob·aining divorce were morally and socially a
boon, I would bow acquiescence in the inequality argument, and I would, say: "Let it be
a common boon to the woman as well as to
the man." But, quite the reverse, that power
is a moral and social evil. The exercise of
that power is a faulz, a transgression against
religion and against society; and, because
reprovable laws have empowered the husband
te commit such fault and such transgression,
will you contend that I am in duty bound
to grant the wife the same means of committing the same fault and the same transgression?
From the fact that mischievous, antiuChristian
and anti-social laws make possible the transgression of the man, am I obliged to vote
another mischievous, anti-Christian and antisocial law making equally possible the transgression of the woman? Nonsense! It is
enough-it is too much-te have legalized the
fault of the man. Do not ask me to duplica-e it in adding the legal fault of the woman,
under the wonderful pretence of re-establishing equality. What a strange misuse of wordsl
Equality in welldoing is indeed a noble ambition, but equality in wrongdoing should
never be aimed at, and should rather be dreaded and spurned energetically.
Let us go a step further. Even if that
inequality argument were not mere sophistry,
Hon. Mr. CHAPAIS.

one would enquire whether the discrimination
maintained so long by the English laws between the husband's and the wife's adultery,
considered as a legal cause for divorce, was
due purely and simply to the arbitrary spirit
of the masculine legislators. Du-ing a long
span of years, the British Parliament has resisted the often-repeated attempts to wipe
away from the statute books such a discrimination. Do you think that there were no reasons
for such a strenuous and lasting opposition?
The opponents of that measure deemed that
the consequences of the wife's adultery were
socially more grievous, more damnable, more
baneful than those of the husband's adultery.
From the moral standpoint, cf course, there is
equality in the fault. Before God the sin of
the husband and the sin of the wife are
weighed evenly in the balance of eternal
justice. But from the social standpoint thera
Such a distinction
is a marked difference.
was well defined by the Lord Chancellor of
England during the debate on the Bill establishing a diverce court in 1857. Let us
quote his words:
The lord Ohancellor said there was an appearance
of great justice about the proposal of the noble earl,
namely, that the same privilege sehould be accorded
to the one sex as to the other. Prima facie that
seemed to be a reasonable proposition. Their Lordships had not, however, to consider whether the sin
was as great in the one case as in the other, but
they were required to adopt such legislation as mxight
bu most expedient for this country. This question
was not whether a husband who was guilty of adultery
night not, in the eyes of God, be equeily guilty with
a wife, but whether such an act of impropriety or of
sin on the part of a busvand called for the same
remedy which ought to be afforded ,where a similar act
was committed by a wife. Wthout entening into any
discussion of the question upon moral or religions
grounds, every man must feel that the injury was not
the same. A wife might, without any loss of caste,
and possibly with reference te the interests of her
children, or even of her husband, condone an act of
adultery on the part of ELhusband. But a husband
could not condone a similar act on the part of a
wife. No one would venture to suggest that a husband
could possibly do se, snd for this among other reasons
which had been pointed out by jurisits-that the
adultery of the wife might be the means of palming
spurious offspring upon the husband, whie the adultery
of the husband could have no such effect with regard
to the wife.

Many other quotations could be brought
in. Here is a declaration of Lord Palmerston:
I think no reasonable man who looks to the constitution of society and the results of marriage can
fail to sec that whatever may be the quality of the
moral offence, the consequences of adultery are utterly
different in the case of the woman.

This is surely a very striking argument.
In order to give it its full significance, let us
suppose the case of a nobleman, cr Of a
wealthy man owning large property and
capital, whose wife commits adultery and
gives birth to an illegitimate son. If the

JUNE 10, 1925
guilty secret is safely kept, it may happen
that this spurious son shall inherit the tities,
estates or wealth of the deceived husband,
to the detriment cf the legitimate children.
At a glance you can see what injustice, what
family spoliation and what social wrong, may
be ',he result af the wife's adultery.
1 think 1 have shown that the opposition
to this Bill is flot inspired by a spirit of injustice and unfairness. Its motive is a deep
attachment to the most sound principles, and
the firma conviction that laws such as this one
are a real peril ta society. Family is the
corner-stone of saciety. Divorce is the most
formidable foe of the family, and every law
aiming at encouraging, at muitiplying, and
popularisiog divorce, is eminently antisocial.
In this country, as in many others, too long
strides have been made in that path. Honourable gentlemen, do you not think that it
is time to caîl a hait?
The stream of passion, of egotism, of treacherous lust, is battering the last protective
dikes of the family. Do not lend a helping
hand to the work of destruction. If you are
lo-t bold enough to entirely close the gates,
do not open thcmn wider, do not give pas-sage
to the roaring and dirty flood. On the contrary. make the gates narrawer, Iess accessible,
less easily opened. Do not be accomplices in
the process of disintegratian which is going on
in Canada, as elsewhere, against our social
institutions. The question af divorce is one
of the episodes of that process. It aims at
destroying the famiiy. And ta better attain
this end its promoters assume the mask of fairness, of justice, of sympatby and pity for the
wroogs of uohappy consorts. 1 do not deny
the existence of those wrongs in many cases,
but I say that divorce i-s no cure, or that
it is a cure worse than the ailment. 0f course,
there are in this wide world husbands and1
wives whose lives are spoiled through no
guilty deeds of their own; but we should remember that the weal of the collectivity must
have precedence over the occasional woes
of the individual. Let the victims of uniucky
marriage suifer manfully and worthily. Such
suiferings will not be lost if their ultimate resuit should be the preservation of that great
institution, the family in ail the stability, the
strength, and the holy influence which make
it the mainstay of society and the bulwark
of the nation.
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH: Honourable gentlemen, I would like ta say one
word on the subjeet of this Bill.
It is
mn substance a Bill to make it easier
tban it is now for a woman ta get a divorce
in this country.
If some of those who think
S-28

433

the sexes ougbt ta be upon an absolute level
of equality in ail tbings would introduce a
Bill- to make it more difficuit for a man ta
secure a divorce, it would seem to me a
different story; but, faiýling such legisiation,
I intend ta oppose the passing of this Bill.
Hon. L. MeMEANS:
flonourabie gentlemen, I have listened with a great deal of
pleasure to the honourable gentleman whio
spake on this side af the House, and lie is
ta be congratuiated on lis eloquence, whîch
is seldom equalled if ever surpassed in this
flouse.
But leaving, aside the matter af
bis gifts in thaýt respect, if we examine the
Bill which is 'before us we must lie onvinced
that it is not a Bill regarding divorce w-hatsoever.
This flouse and the flouse of Commons
grant divorce, and the oniy law they follow
is the English law, which puts bath sexes
an the sanie basis. If dfivorce is wrong, as
the honourable gentleman stated, that is a
different question aitogether; 'but I am very
much afraid tha-t divorce is here ta stay. It
is recogn-ized as part of the iaw af the country;
it is in force in sanie of the provinces of
this Dominion. aod we recognize it in this
flouse. We recognize that husband and wife
are on equai footing wýhen they came ta the
Senate ta apply for a divorce.
What wauld lie the position af affairs if this
Bill did not pass?
We wouid have the residents of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba
coming ta this flouse ta apply for divorces
when the question would be raised, whether
there was any cruelty on the part ai the
busband. What benefit would that beý?
It
wauld merely mean adding a great deal of
expense ta them; it would clog up the business
of this flouse; and in a great many cases it
wauld drive the applicants ta the United
States for divorce, where they wouid get it
an grounds that we would not listen ta.
The English haw up ta 1923, as I understand
it, was that cruelty an the part of the husband.
had ta be. proven.
It is very difficuit ta
define what legal cruelty is.
I think oomne
judges have gone.so far as to say that adultery
on the part of a husband is legal cruelty ta
a certain extent. Other judges have defined
cruel'ty as involving fear of one's lufe, or danger
taOone's lufe, before they would recognize it
as legal cruelty. However, the British Parliament no doubt gave thîs matter a great
deal ai attention, before passing the Act in
1923 recognizing the equality af the sexes.
We know that in the western provincesManitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta-the Act
conierring the power ta grant divorces was
not practically intended in that way. As I
understand it, the Act mereIy constituted, the

courts, and provided that those courts would
have the same power as was possessed by the
courts sitting at Westminister in England.
Consequently the courts had the power over
divorce.
But they did not have the law as
it existed in England in 1923: they went on
the old English law passed in 1857 or 1858,
if I recollect rightly.
They have the same
law to-day, and it is simply a question for
the judges to determine how far cruelty has
to be proven in connection with the question
of adultery.
This Bill is sent to this House after having
been thoroughly debated in another place and
It would be an

absurdity if we should have to say to the
people of the western provinces: "You may
operate under that old Act of 1858, but if
you want to take advantage of the law as it
exists in England to-day, you will have to
come and apply to the Senate."
We cannot discuss divorce in connection with
this Bill, whatever opinions we may have on
it.
It is only a question of bringing the
English law to apply to those western provinces, because the Bill does not affect any
other provinces. However opposed any member of this louse is to divorce, I cannot see
why any sensible man can oppose this Bill.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I rise merely to say
that I intend to vote against this Bill, for two
reasons: first, from conscientious religious conviction I am against divorce of all kinds; and,
secondly, even if I were not opposed to
divorce, J would be against this Bill, because
to mv mind there is no parity at all between
the offence of the husband and the offence
of the wife, for the strong and excellent reasons
which have b-en given by the honourable
member from Granville (Hon. Mr. Chapais) in
the brilliant address which he has made on
the question.
Reflections have been made on the Fathers
of Confederation in sone quarters because, in
fram.ing -the constitution,
they recognized
divorce. It is true that by subsection 26 of
section 91 they declared that legislation on the
subject of marriage and divorce would appertain exclusively to the Dominion of Canada.
They were called upon to idefine the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada and tha:t of
the provinces, and they were of neoessity
compelled to deal with the suibject, the more
so because divorce was in existence at that
time, and therefore it could not be ignored.
Moreover, they were called upon to dea:l with
the matter because in subsection 12 of section
92, enumerating the subjects which fall within
the exclusivie jurisdiction of the provinces, we
find included the solemnization of marriage.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS.

They were called upon necessarily to declare
what legislative power would deal wi.th the
one matter or with the other; therefore it is
not surprising that the Fasthers of Confedeation dealt with that question as they did.
They miight have assigned it exclusively to
the provinces, but they deemed it propet to
assign it to the Federal Parliiament excepting
the solemnization of marriage. Thus it was
left to this Parliament to decide whether or
not any legislation should be passed on the
question. We have remained to this day, for
over fifty years, without any legislation, and
I think we can well afford to continue as we
have donc.
Hien. :Mr. BARNARD: Honourable gentlemen. coming as I do from a western province
-although
sometimes not deemed worthy of
miention by my friends a little to the east, in
what I may odill the Middle West-I may say
that this ;is a question which is of very deep
interest and importance uo the people of that
province.
I have listened with a great deal of interest
to the speech of the honourable gentleman
from Granville (Hon. Mr. Chapais). Not only
do I disagree with his conclusions, but I find
myself equally differing with him in some of
his |premises. He speaks of divorce as being
responsible for broken homes, for uncared-for
children, and, so forth. I think it is fair to
point out that the homes were broken long
before the divorce was granted. and the
children were n'eglected long before the petition
for divorce was filed.
I do not wish to continue the debate at
this moment, as I would like to look up one
or two authorities that may be of interest to
the House. I therefore move the adjournment

SENATE
Hon. Mr. REID: Although not admitting
that. He assured me that if the matter went
before the Exchequer Court they would fight
the claims, and the amount should not exceed
the $5,000, but they did not think it was fair
to go with the $5,000 maximum. My answer
to him was that if it had been decided finally
to construct the two miles, and if, though
costing a little more than the $5,000, it would
be less expensive to go that way than to
take an aitogether different route, then I
would not oppose the plan when it came
before the Railway Committee of the Senate
and he explained it to the Committee as he
had explained it to me. That was my position.
and now I would like to see the Bill referred
to the Railway Committee, who could hear
Mr. Ruel's story as he told it to me. He
would give to the Committee the reasons
why he wants to have the maximum allowance
increased, and if he can convince the Conmittee, as he has convinced me, that it would
be better to pay perhaps a littie more, I
have no objection to make to the Committee
deciding in favour of his proposal. Therefore I would like to have the honourable
leader of the House send this Bill to the
Railway Committee, as other Bills have been
sent.
Perhaps the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Senate will do this much homage to my honourable friend, that in view of the fact that
be has been convinced of the correctness of
the arguments of the Canadian National Railway representative, we shall adopt his judgment as our own. in order to facilitate mattors and pass this Bill through Committee of
the House. It is a very simple matter. It
must go before the Exchequer Court. The
Canadian National Railways will make the
best case possible. The maximum figure is
$14.000. I would urge my honourable friend
not to insist on this Bill being sent to the
Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs
and Harbours, when he himself is satisfied and
no other honourable member asks that it be
sent to that Committee.

its being referred to the Standing Committee
on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours. That
Committee did consider all these branches
last year. We gave more time to this little
two-mile branch than to lines involving millions of dolars. In this case the maximum is
increased from $5,OCO to $14,000, but the
amount is to be settled by the Exchequer
Court. Surelv we should not attach such importance to this matter as to abandon the
ordinary procedure of dealing with such Bills
in Committee of the Whole.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
point out to my honourable friend that while
he may be thoroughly convinced of the
reasonableness of this proposal, and while the
General Solicitor of the Canadian National
Railways has satisfied my honourable friend
from Grenville (Hon. Mr. Reid), there are
ninety odd other members in this Chamber
and they have not had the opportunity of
discussing the ~matter with the General
Solicitor. The same Bill was referred last
Session to the Railway committee, and it was
one of the most contentious Bills under conThat may

have been due to the paucity of the road, its
length being only two miles, though it is,
I presume, of standard width. While my
honourable friend may be thoroughly satisfied, it might be unsafe to take for granted
that the ninety odd other members of this
Chamber will be satisfied.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am not depriving the ninety odd members of this Chamber of their riaht to examine into this Bill.
They may do so in Committee of the Whole.
I would only point out to my honourable
friend that the railways have the right to
build a six-mile branch without coming to
Parliament, and this is a two-mile branch.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But they
cannot appropriate $2.000 without coming to
Parliament.

My only objection is
Hon. Mr. REID:
that a precedent may be established. Other
Bills may come down tha-t should bu referred
to that Committee. I think the other members of the Committee should hear Mr. Ruel's
statement. It should not take very long, and
the Bill would then follow the ordinary
course.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: May I refresh
my honourable friend's memory? The situation existing is rather cruel to three or four
fairly large centres, who are awaiting the
completion of those two miles in order to
save a ten-mile haul, which they are now
ob!iged to make to China Clay. The twomile extension will bring this railway to St.
Rémi d'Amherst, to which there are three or
four villages already tributary, within a
radius of ten or twelve miles.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think
it is a very bad precedent to set. While
these branch line railway Bills may be regarded as Government measures, yet to all
intents and purposes they are railway Bills,
which ordinarily are referred to the Standing
Committee on Railways, Telegraphs, and
Harbours.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I make this
request because we have had such a tremendous amount of discussion on this matter.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If my honourable friend will assure us that the Bill
will not be in jeopardy if it goes before the

Committee.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think it would

On section 1-commencement of construction subject to 'certain conditions:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: What are
the claims referred to which have to be
adjusted?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:" It is simply a
question of the claims on the right of way.
Should the location of the said line of railway be
approved by the Governor in Council, gpon the location of the line of railway of the River Rouge Railway
Company or the Rouge River Railway Company between China Clay and St. Rémi d'Amherst, the compensastion to be paid by the Company in respect of
the acquisition of an unencumbered title to such right
of way and all prior construction thereon shall, on
the application of the Company, be determnined by the
Exchequer Court of Canada and shall be based on the
value to the Company of such right of way and prior
construction, but shall not in any case exceed fourteen
thousand dollars. The Company upon such determination shal. pay into the Exchequer Court the anount
of compensation so detenmined, which shall be distributed by the Court among the persons filing claims
in respect thereof in such sucms as the Court may
detenine.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
What
would be the amount already claimed? There
must be an amount that bas been determined,
particularly in view of the fact that the Government has fixed this at $14,000 a mile.

437

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I am in.formed
that the company which built along that line
claim to have made considerable expenditure
on the roadbed. I do not know how much
they claim to have paid for the right of way.
We are paying no claims for 825,000 or $30,000,
but they were very obdurate in contending
that they had gone to that expenditure. Of
course, there is quite a gap between $5,000
and the amount they were claiming. I do
not know how the Canadian National Railways came to the figure of $14,000; but at all
events that is the leeway.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Is this
purely for payment in satisfaction of those
claims, or does it include an amount of assistance to be given by the Government to the
National Railway?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Ne. This is
the 'Canadian National Railway, of course.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Are they
coming back again for more money for construction purposes?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No.
The
matter was settled last year when we voted
the building of the line but -restricted the
Canadian National Railways to $5,000 in the
liquidation of these claims.
Hon. Mr. REID: If I remember rightly,
when the matter came before me there was
some firm in Montreal that had the title of
the two miles. They had a lot of work done
-in
fact, the ballasting was all done and
ready for the rails-when the trouble arose
with Mackenzie and Mann. The Mackenzie
and Mann interests would not take over the
road because of the large claims made for
these two miles. When it was to be taken
over by the Canadian National Railway a
very large amount was asked for these two
miles; and I understood at the time that no
money had been paid to the people who
actually did the work of ballasting and so
on. The firm failed and did not meet their
liabilities, and the amount that we voted was
to pay a portion of the claims of the people
in that locality who did the work, and was
also to include the right of way.
Last year it was represented that some
$30,000 or $35,000 would be required to pay
the claims of those who actually did the
work. I thought at the time that was too
much, and that we should keep the figure
down to $5,000. Mr. Ruel, however, tells me
that the work was actually done, and that
$5,000 is really less than should be paid. He
thinks more should be paid, although the
other people are not willing to accept $14,000.
The money has not even been deposited in

438

court, and the railway is going to fight the
case and keep the amount down as low as
possible. That is the reason why I said that
the Committce could take whatever action
it thought fit, and I would agree.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
With reference to the last section:
The Company upon such determination shall pay
into the Exchequer Court the amuount of compensation so determinedThen comes the point of distribution. As
I understand it, there is the company which
claims $25,000, or whatever it is, and then
there is a claim by the people who
actually did the work and who say that that
corporation or whatever it was had not met
the bills. In respect to the court's determination. will the second-mentioned class of
claimants corne in and have their claims adjudicated by the court?

Hon. E. D. SMITH: Honourable gentlemen, it was understood when these two Bi'ls
were sent to the Committee that discussion
on the principles of them would be taken up
when the Committee's report wss submitted
to this House, and I would like to say a few
words in regard to this Treaty with the
Netherlands.

440

SENATE

This Treaty provides for a reduction in duty
on a number of articles. It is one of many
Treaties that have been negotiated with
different countries during the past two or
three years, all of which est into the principle
of protection. We have not in this country
any positive policy, whether of protection or
free trade or revenue tariff. I think that we
ought to have some positive policy. We are
supposed to have a protective policy in
general, but as a matter of fact it is simply
a hotch-potch.
There is ample protection
upon some lines, perhaps enough protection
on others, whereas on a number of other
articles which ought to be protected there is
either not enough or none at all.
The principle of protection is one that has
been sustained by the people of this country
many different times, and the reason for that
is that, looking around, they see what has
been the effect throughout the world in the
last fifty years. There was a time when
Great Britain had the policy of protection
and established herself as supreme in the
markets of the world. Great Britain hoped
to retain that supremacy by .doing away with
import duties and making the cost of living
low and labour cheap. Other nations, though
-Germany,
France, the United States, and
most of the nations of the world-saw that
that policy would destroy any opportunity for
them ever to becone great, powerful, prosperous nations; so they adopted the policy
of protection-and I think that no honourable member of this Chamber can say that it
has not succeeded. The United States in less
and a hundred years have risen from being
an agrcultural country to being the greatest
manufacturing country in the world. Is there
any man in this Chamber who would say
that thev would have dona that had they not
protected their industries? I do not think so,
I do not think it is possible for anybody to
maintain that contention.
Unfortunately, we are in a worse position.
Not only have we to contend with all the
nations of Europe, with their cheap labour,
but we have the United States, with its 3,000mile border, alongside us, and its mass production, which enables it to manufacture in
most lines more cheaply than we can possibly
do. So, as regards the rest of the world, we
are in a position even worse than was the
position of the United States fifty or a hundred years ago.
It seems to me that if we are to sustain
ourselves and ever to become a great nation,
we must adopt a policy of adequate protection.
I think "adequate" expresses what we want
better than any other word, unless we might
Hon. Mr. SMITH.

qualify it by saying, "and not more than
adequate."
I do not believe in any duty
higher than is necessary. We all know that
wbere duties are higher than are required,
advantage may be taken of them; and we
shall never know whether or not that is the
case in any industry until we have a board
of experts whose business it will be to examine
each item of the tariff and all tht industries
of the country, and make a report to the
Covernment, stating what is neeessary mn
order that the industries of Canada may be
placed on an equal footing with those of
other countries. Until we get that board we
shall not know what we are doing. We do
not know what we are doing now. We are
going along with hit-or-miss arrangements; as
I said before, with more protection on some
industries than we need, with a sufficiency on
others, and with less than enough on others.
Many industries have already died, others
are dying to-day, and we witness a great
exodus from this country. We sec our population departing because there is not work
here for them to do.
Surely it is the duty of the Government,
if it has any duty at all, to see that work is
provided for the people who live in this
country and for such others as may come in.
The Government's policy is inconsistent, and
it will always be inconsistent, until we have
a board of tariff experts, men whose duty it
will be to examine every industry and report
to the Government what is needed. Then it
will be for the Government to determine its
policy, whether it is to be a policy of protection, or a policy of a revenue tariff, or a
policy of free trade. The Government today has no means of knowing, and nobody
can tell, whether an industry bas sufficient
protection, too much, or too little.
Only
those engaged in the industry can tell, and
their books should be open to this board
of tariff experts. After the representatives of
every industry have come forward and stated
their case, pointing out what they think they
ought to have, it should be the duty of this
board of experts to see whether they were
telling the truth or not. The board should
have power to examine their books and, if
necessary, to go further than that-to go to
the country that is our strongest competitor
and ascertain if what they state is true.
Having learned all the facts, it should report
to the Gorernment, and the Government
should impose on the articles such a duty as
vill enable the Canadian to be a least on an
equal footing with the strongest foreign competitor. Surely that is the least we may expect of the Government. I should go further

Now we are negotiating a Treaty with
Australia.
I do not know what are the
details of that Treaty; we have been waiting
to see thein before us. I understand, at any
rate, that one of its provisions is that fruit
products, fruit preserved, articles that are
made of fruit, are to come into this country
under the British preference rates. It is said
by the supporters of this Government that
they are lowering those duties, and that all
those concessions are needed by the farmers.
The farmers of the West are demanding of
the Government, with a pistol at their head,
that they make reductions in order that the
farmers can produce, and it is said that they
cannot be benefitted by putting duties on
wheat and .cattle, but can only be benefitted
by taking duties off the necessaries they have
to buy. Here are numerous industries that
can be benefitted by increased protection; but,
.insteid of giving the farmers this increased
protection, the government take it off. Every
time there is a Treaty made with any country
there is something taken off what the farmers
produce, and I understand that a portion of
the concessions we are going to give under
the Australian Treaty is that duty is to be
reduced on manufactured fruit products.
In regard to the duties on fruit, I want to
show that they are ridiculously low. As I
sec, this tariff, it is a hotch-potch; there is
nothing consistent about it. The duties on
many manufacturing goods are 30 per cent
or 25 per cent; but the duties on fruit are
all specific duties, that were fixed 40 years
ago and have not been changed, with one or
two exceptions. Forty years ago a duty of
2 cents a pound or 1 cent a pound many have
been fairly protective, but the cost of producing that fruit is now double and treble,
yer the duties remain the same. The price
Is based on cost, and the price has d>oubled
and trebied because the cost lias doubled
and trcbled, yet the duty remains the same.
A duty that was 25 per cent 40 years ago is
now only 10 per cent.
We imported into this country last year
$722.000 worth of apples. Although the duty
on apples was increased during the administration preceding this ta 90 cents a barrel, it is
onlv 18-1/3 per cent. It is not consistent with
the duties on manufactured goods.
Apricots, of which we imported $79,761
worth, has a duty of 1/2 cent a pound, equal
to 7-2/3 per cent ad valorem. Cherries were
imported to the extent of $79,674; the duty
is 2 cents a potund, which is equivalent to
only Il per cient. Peaches were brought in
to the amount of $609,318; the duty is 1 cent
a pound, which, converted into ad valorem,
Hon.

Mr. SMITH.

is 24 per cent-the only one that is in any
way reasonably near the duties that are protective in this country. Pears were imported
to the extent of $807,059, with a duty of j
cent a pound, equivalent to 11-1/2 per cent ad
valorem. Plums came into this country to the
extent of $358,212, the duty being 30 cents
a bushel, equivalent to 8-1/2 per cent. Strawberries were brought in, worth $750,400, under
a duty of 2 cents a pound, equivalent ta 132/3 per cent.
Honourable gentlemen will see that all those
duties are low. They are not protective duties
in any sense at all. They are not even
revenue-producing duties. We could get double
the revenue from those fruits if we doubled
the duties and imported as much as we do
now, and if the importations were less than
now the duty would be somewhat protective
ta the fruit-growers, at any rate.
The fruit-growing industry is a magnificent
one, employing a good many thousands of
people, but it lias been in the most depressed
condition for the past four years that it ever
has been in the history of this country. While
fruit-growers have been producing pretty
heavy crops, those crops would all be marketed in Canada at a fair price if it were not
for the enormous importation. We import
almost as much fruit in the season when our
fruit is on the market as we produce at home,
notwithstanding that we are producing at a
loss. It is not correct to say that those
fruits are brought in during different months
from those when ours are on the market. It
is said that plums, peaches and pears come in
when ours are not already on the market; but
I want to controvert that theory by the
statistics from the bluebooks. I have a statement going back for five years; but I will
just give the figures of last year in regard to
plums. Our plums come on the market in
July, August, September, and October; those
are the heaviest months of production. Last
July we imported 31,000 bushels of plums-I
am just dealing with one item, plums, because
I do not wish to cumber the record; and
everything else is in the same line. In August
we imported 30,000 bushels; in Septemiber
30.000 bushels.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: Are not plums variable
as to when they grow, one year with another?
lon. Mr. SMITH: No. In Ontario we
have missed only one crop of plums in 40
years. We have many years when thousands
of baskets of plums fall ta the ground unpicked because the markets are filled month
after month, the whole season through, with
Aierican plums. It 'may be asked: "How

can that be so? Surely they are dearer." Yes,
they are dearer; people pay twice as mauch
for those American plums, and they are not
haif as good as ours. Our fruit-growers are
producing themn now at a dead loss, and our
plums can be bought at a good deal less

position is peculiar, and may seemn difficuit
to explain, yet it is quite explainable.
HalIf of the plums, peaches and pears are
sold by the fruiterer at his littie stand. He
selis tbem out by the pound or by the small
package. He has found by long experiencp.
that Ontario fruit deesys rapidly. When it
is ripe and luscious it will flot keep long;- if
by accident hie holds it over for one day,
some of it begins to, spot, and ha has t.
sort it over. If hie keeps it two or three days,
it becomes very bad, and he loses a lot. He
bas learnied that there is more profit to him
in buying California fruit, which does not
rot. It is more like the turnip; it does flot
taste well, but it looks well; it is large and
fine, and well packed, and the fruiterer d'oes
flot lose anytbing, but makes a profit on
that fruit. Be pays twice as much for it
as for our fruit, but the customer does nol
know much about it, because he is only
buying it singly or by the dozen, and perhaps
is flot paying more than hie would have to pay
for home-grown fruit bought in suc~h smal
quantities. The fruiterer absorbs the difference. because he is saving what he would
lose by decay on Canadian fruit. Thus onehall of the fruit sold in this country is
California and western fruit, simply because
it doas not rot, it keeps well, and consumers
pay little more for it.

gentlemen, I know the theories of my honourable friend; we have heard 'them befone; they

not believe in rieoiprocal

back on French soil when the French Government arranged with the United States for

we had had most favoured nation treatment
in the French market, whatever advantages
might be extended to the United States on the
morrow woulid have benefited us also.
Now, I claim that the result of our work
in obtaining favours-reciprocal favours, if
you will-from the many countries with which
we have arranged treaty agreements, has been
to the advantage of Canada. It is shown in
our export trade, which has expanded in

SENATE
France through the work of my honourable
friend, and through the Treaty which we have
made it will continue to expand. Surely my
honourable friends do not believe that we can
go out into the world and obtain advantages
in markets without giving a little of something in retuçn which even accrues to the
advantage of the consumer in Canada. In
theory I am a free trader because I am a
Liberal. I recognize however, that there are
fiscal walls between the nations; but wherever
I find that we can obtain imports that will
not hurt Canadian industry to any material
degree and will be to the advantage of the
consumer, I believe that the loss is not a
great one. I believe that without any stimulus
from the outside our Canadian producers
would be likely to lie down.
I do not intend to traverse the whole ground
covered by the honourable gentleman from
the Niagara district (Hon. Mr. Smith), but I
may tell him that I feel, as he does, that
advantages would accrue to Canada if we
had a board of technical experts who would
pass up on every item of our tariff. We have
had the sime hope for the last fifteen years.
The preceding Administration brought in a
Bill which met with some amendments in
this Chamber, but it never tried seriously to
establish a tariff board. I have been told that
there was considerable division of opinion
in the ranks of the Conservative Party, and
even in the Cabinet of the time, as to the
opportuneness of giving effect to the idea of
a tariff board for Canada. Now, there are
those in the Liberal Party-and I am one of
them-who believe that such a board would
be an advantage to Canada. I hope to see it
estaïblished before long.. But I want to inform my honourable friend that the delegations that come from ail parts of the country
to ask the Government for reductions in duties
are not ail from the farming community. I
can tell him that I have seen many a delegation from the manufacturers of this country
asking for reductions of duties for the advantage of their own trade.
The making of a tariff is a -very complex
operation. I think I have had occasion to
say here that in 1904 or 1905 the Manufacturers Association of Canada started out
to prepare a scientific tariff. It was to be
prepared by various sections of their Association, covering iron and steel' and textiles, and
going through the whole list. They worked
for months trying to reconcile the interests
of their own sections and groups, and in
the end they could not reconcile them, and
recognized their utter failure. The different
interests were in conflict: there was a diversity
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

of opinion as between the producer of raw
materials and the manufacturer of the finished
product. And yet they were working academically, on paper: they were not meeting
the consumer. They were trying, in their
egotistical self-interest-that may be to
strong an expression-to make an ideal tariff
to present to the Government. Were they
thinking of the consumer? I venture to say
that such a thought did not for one moment
enter into their minds. And yet they failed
miserably in producing the ideal tariff. They
had their experts working together, and
sometimes, wlhen they would agree, one of
the men would write to the Minister of

place yesterday; I agreed to that increase of
duty on my goods, because I had to in order
to bear a similar increase on the raw materials
entering into the manufacture of my goods.
Kindly take note that I differ with my group
on this matter." Mr. Fielding had in his
h9nds hundreds of letters coming from people
who had in the give and take consented to an
increase, and who regretted it; and the result
was that they were never able to bring forth
that ideal tariff which would have made for
the prosperity of the manufacturers of Canada, as they believed.

honourable the junior member for Ottawa
(Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster), who was

b smiling when he hears me speaking of the
wrangles of the manufactureirs as to the share
of profit they should extract from the consener, and as to what should bellong to A and
what to B. It is not such an easy thing as
people believe to prepare an adequate tariff.
"Adequate" is a fine word on the Lips of
people who use it, but it is a hard nut to
crack for Ithe man who has to sign the report
to Couecil, and bring his proposais to Parliament, and say, "This is the tariff for Cana.da."
Hon. Mr. TANNER: How would it do to
make a short eut and go back to the Fielding
tariff of 1897 and have another golden era?

That tariff was described in (Nova
a protective tariff.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Wll, iMr. Fieldin, had his own ideas; ho had bis own formilæ, he had his own podi'cy. The greatest
comiplaint that is being made even in this
Chahmber is against an inerease of the preference on woollens and on boots and shoes,
brought about at the instance of the Honourable iMr. Fielding as Minister of Finance. It
may be judged adverse'ly, but it is the resuit
of bis mature experienlce. He was the father

JUNE 11, 1925of the preference, and he has felt that the
preference shoulrd be increased for those whose
markets are open wide to Canadian produots.
I draw 'the attention of my honourable frienc
to the favt that Canada would be in a far
better position today, and we would not hear
any compiaint or -recrimination or waiuing, if
Mr. Fieilding's gift to the people of Canada
in 1911 had been accepted.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: My honourable friend
is perfectly aware that after Mr. Fieldinig had
submitted this tariff in 1897 there was said
to have been such bewailing that he took his
tariff home for about a month, and brought
it back with the protectionist policies re-introduced into it.
Hon. IMr. DANDURAND: The tariff of
1897 speaks for itself. I know there was a
demand made by the manufacturers for an increase in 1906-07; but they recognized that
they were working -day and night, and that
tUnes were bountiful for them. They stated,
when questioned by Mr. Fiedding, that it was
not for the present they feared, but for the
future, as a wave of depression had appeared
in the United Startes, andlthere was danger of
an overflow of slaughtered goods on the Canadian market. And Mr. Fielding, taking them
at their word that things were perfeotly satisfaotory for the present, instead of raising the
tariff in 1907, gave them, what they seemed to
need. namelly, the anti-dumping clause, which
was for the purpose of preventing the dumpmig of American goods on our markets in days
of depression. That was the solatium he gave
them, but he never 'thought of raising the
tariff because he had same regard for the
co.nsuming public.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: The honourable gentleman dlaims that he is a free trader. I ask
him why he did not put into, force the tarifl
as laid down in the Liberal platform a few
years ago.
Hon. Mr. McOORMICK: I want to say

just a few words.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: The honourabâe
gentleman has no right to speak now.
Hon. Mr. MCORMICK: Why?
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question is

In all cases, the reply of the mover of the original

IMPORTATION OF "ROCK LOBSTER"
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. MeLEAN inquired of the Government:
1. la the Department of Customs and Excise aware
that cray fish in tin containers is being imported into
Canada, and sold in Canada labelled as "Rock Lobster,"
thereby unfairly competing with the lobster packing
business in Canada
2. Is it permissible to import such fish under the
name of "Rock Lobster"?
3. Is the Department of Fisheries aware of the
matters above stated, and if so what measures does
the Department intend to take to protect the lobster
packing business of Canada

Hon. Mr. DAN'DURAND:
I have an
answer for the honourable gentleman. Very
likely it was prepared before his remarks of
yesterday reached the Department.
The
answer is:
1. There is nothing on the files of the Department
of Customs and Excise relating to this matter.
2. No.
3. Yes.
The Department of Marine and Fisheries
bas ruled that the label on cans of such imported for
sale in Canada must show the designation "Crayfish"
together with the words "Spiny Lobster."

POSITION OF COLONEL A. H. BORDEN
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. TANNER inquired of the Government:
1. What position in the Militia Department or
Militia Service did Colonel A. H. Borden hold during
the current year?
2. What are (a) the salary and (b) allowances,
respectively, of the position?
3. Is he retired, and if so, from what date does his
retirenent date?
4. Is he at present off on leave; and if se for what
length of time; and on what rate of pay?
5. On retirement what amount of annual allowance
will he be entitled to?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Stand.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: May I ask my honourable friend to endeavour to obtain a reply
to this inquiry? I should think that the information could be made up in ten or fifteen
minutes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have already
asked my Secretary to telephone, and he has
telephoned twice to the Department. I will
try to get into touch with the Deputy Minister myself.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I do not think there
is any reason for delay.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Some explanation for the delay was given, but my memory

APPOINTMENT OF SENATE OFFICIALS
OFFICERS OF

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gentlemen, I have obtained a
opinion of the law officers of
represented by the Deputy
Justice, on the matter of the
of Black Rod. I will read it:

Honourable

OPINION

OF

LAW

Department of Justice
Canada
Ottawa, June 8th, 1925.
Dear Sir,I have your letter of the 4th instant to the Minister of Justice submitting copies of an Order in
Ceuncil (P.C. 877) of the 3rd instant with reference
te the position of Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod.
I infer from your letter that yon desire to be advised
gcenrally as to the legality and effect of the Order in
Council referred to, and in this connection I have bad
the advantage of discussing the matter fully with Mr.
Creighton, the law clerk of the Senate.
In the first place, I may say that I think it unpîuestionable that the Gentleman Usher of the Black
Rod is an officer of the Senate; that up to the year
1918 be was appointed by the Crown; that the right
of the Crown te make the appointment was undoubted
and was recognized by the Stnate itself by resolution
in the year 1867; that be is a permanent officer of the
Senate and that the provisions of the Civil Service
Act regarding appointment are applicable to him by
virtue of the provisions of sec. 34 thereof; and that,
consequiietly, unless the position bas been excluded
frons the operiation of the Act under the provisions
of sec. 38B thereof, the appointiment would rest with
I take it, therefore,
the Civil Service Commission.
that the questions as to which advice is required are
whethsr the positin bas been validly excluded from
the operation of the Civil Service Act, and if se, by
whom and in what manner is the appointment to be
made.
Sec. 38B of the Civil Service Act is as follows:
"38B. (1) In any case where the Commission decides
that it is not practicable inor in the public interest to
apply this Act to any position or positions, the Conmission may, with the approval of the Governor in
Council, exclude such position or positions in whole
or in part from the operation of the Act and make
such regulations as are deemed advisable prescribing
how such position or positions are to be dealt with."
it sill be observed that under this provision the
Civil Service Commission bas power te do two things
(a) exclude the position in whole or in part from
the operation of the Act, and (b) make such reguitions as are deemed advisable prescribing how such
position is to be dealt with, the whole subject to
the approval of the Governor in Council.
With a
view to the exercise of these powers the Commission
nacie a recommendation to His Excellency in Council
reading as follows:
"The Civil Service Commission recommends under
section 38B of the Civil Service Act of 1918 as
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

amended, that the followi:ig position on the staff of
the Senate of Canada be wholly excluded from the
operation of the Civil Service Act:
"Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod.
"In conformity with section 38B of the Act, regulations are required, prescribing how such appointment
shall be made:
"The Civil Service Commission recommends:
"L. Tit
it is not in the publie interest to apply
the Civil Service Act to the appointment of an
Officcer to the position of Gentleman Usher of the
Black Rod;
"2. That the said position, so far as the impending
appointment is concerned, be wholly excluded from
the operation of the Civil Service Act;
"3. That the appointment thereto be, and is hereby
vested in the competent authority in that behalf to
be determined aid nominated by the Law Officers of
the Crown."
and upon this recommendation the Order in Council
above referred to was passed, reading as follows:
"The Committee of the Privy Council have had
before them a report, dated 2nd June, 1925, from the
Right Honourable W. L. Mackenzie King, the Prime
Minister, submitting a recommendation of the Civil
Service Commission, under section 38B of the Civil
Service Act of 1918 as amended, that the following
position on the staff of the Senate of Canada be
wholly excluded from the operation of the Civil Service
Act, viz. Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod.
"The Civil Service Commission are of the opinion
that it is not in the public interest to apply the Civil
Service Act to the appointment of an officer to the
position of Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod and
have the'refore recommended that the said position be
wholly excluded from the operation of the said Act.
"The Committes concur in the foregoing and submit
the same for Your Excellency's approval."
After careful consideration of the above provisions
aid ;f the representations ably presented by Mr.
Creighton, the opinion of this Department is that
the effect of what has been donc is to wholly exclude
the position in question froin the operation of the
Civil Service Act and to restore the power of appointment to the Governor in Couneil, where it formerly
belonged.
Having thus stated the concluded view of the department, it may be useful to discuss the several
objections advanced by Mr. Creighton and to state
the departmental view regarding the same.
In the first place it was suggested that the recommnendation of the Civil Service Commission should
have been approved by a resolution of the Senate
rather than by an order of the Governor in Council.
Support for that view is said to be found i sec. 34
of the Civil Service Act, which provides in effect that
whenever anv action is authorized to be taken by the
Governor in Council, such action, with respect to the
officers, clerks and employees of the Senate, shall be
It is recognized that there is

some plausibility to this argument, but the department is unable to conclude that it is well fouaided.
The provision in question relates only to action required in connection with appointments, transfers,
promotions, salaries, increases and classification aid
lias no reference to any action required in connection
witb the exclusion of any position or positions from
the operation of th Act.
I masy add that there are precedents for this view
in the cases of the Assistant Clerk and the Sergeantat-Arms of the House of Commons.
in
Order
(2) Objection is also made that the
Council approving of the recommendation of the Con-

JUNE 11, 1925

449

mission does not recite the whole of the recommendation but merely refers to the provision thereo
excluding the position wholly from the operation of
the Civil Service Act.
It is not thought in the
Department, however, that this circumstance affects
the validity of the recommendation or the Order in
Couneil.
The view of the Department is that the
Order in Council by necessary implication approves
the recommendation of the Civil Service CommiSion
as submitted, and that the recommendation in Boy
case does nothiîg more than exclude the position from
the operation of the Act and to restore the power
of appointment to the competent authority. Paragraph
1 does nothing more than state that it is -not in the
public interest to apply the Civil Service Act to the
position in question.
Paragraph 2 is of no effect
because as the main part of the recommendation
excludes the position altogether from the operation
of the Act, it would necessarily follow that the said
position, so far as the impending appointment is
concemed, would be wholly excluded.
With regard to paragraph 3, objection was taken
that this purports to authorize the law officers of the
Crown to determine by whom the appointment is to
be made. In the view of the Department, however,
this is an erroneous interpretatioa, and that the
paragraph, when properly
construed, amounts to
nothing more than that the appointment is to be
made by whatever was the competent authority before
the position was made subject to the provsions of
the Act, and that upon that point of law officers of
the Crown would be asked to advise.
(3) It was further suggested that the right of the
Crown to make this appointment having been taken
away by the Civil Service Act and vested in the
Civil Service Commission, the excluding of the position
from the operation of the Act in the manner above
mentioned is not sufficient to restore the power of
appointment to the Crown. In view, however, of
what has been said above, the Department is unable
to accept this viewa.
Yours faithfully,
W. Stuart Edwards,
D. M. of J.

in my honourable friend the ex-leader of
the Senate, I take it for granted that the
Senate would be agreeable to the honourable
gentleman and myself getting into touch with
the Prime Minister in due course.

In effect this opinion of the Department of
Justice is that from tihe moment that the
Civil Service Commission lifts the Act, or
declares that it is not to apply to the appointment of Black Rod, that appointment reverte
to the authority to which it belonged when
it was transferred to the Civil Service Commission. If that be so I would say, as to the
-other officials who have seats in this Chamber,
and who were appointed when the Senate
had adopted the Civil Service Act, that the
Civil Service Commission, whenever it wished,
could release the appointment of those
officials, and that such appointments having
been transferred to the Commission by the
Senate itself, they would revert to this
Chamber, as formerly.
Regarding the appointment of Black Rod,
I may say that I had a moment's conversation with the Prime Minister before I entered
the Chamber, and he informed me that he
would be most pleased to discuss the person
to be appointed with the leaders of the Senate.
Knowing the absolute confidence we ail share

Exclude such position or positions, in whole or in
part, from the operation of the Act, and make such
regulations as are deemed advisable, prescribing how
such position or positions are to be dealt with.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I should
like to say that, notwithstanding the presentation of this case by my honourable
friend expressing the view of the Government
upon it, I fail to concur.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is not the
Government's view that I am expressing.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I must say
that I had a very strong opinion, at the time
that the Government set the matter in motion
-or rather, set the Civil Service Commission
in motion-that it looked as if the Government desired to appropriate the appointment
to itself. Furthermore, in view of the very
doubtful order which was issued by the Civil
Service Commission, in which they failed to
exercise the duties cast upon them by the
statute, chapter 12, of 1918, I rather felt that
there would be no probability of the matter
of the appointment being left with the Senate.
I wish to say that the statute is quite clear
on the subject, that there must be coupled
with the order of exclusion provision for the
manner in which the appointment shall be
made, and that any order issuing from the

Civil Service Commission that does not
mention how the appointment shall be made
is in my judgment nugatory. The language
of the statute is:

My honourable friend will scarcely contend
that the order as issued by the Civil Service
Commission can be interpreted as a compliance with this Act. The Civil Service
Commission did not include in their order
the manner in which the appointment should
be made. That was left open-eft so open
as to permit of the Governor in Council
making the aippointment in any way whatsoever.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: After the law
officers of the Crown had expressed their
views.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am now
expressing my dissent from the views of the
law officers of the Crown. My statement
that the law officers of the Crown would probably anticipate the wish of the Government
has I think, been fully verified by the result.

REVISED EDITION

SENATE

450

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I said to my
honourable friend the other day that I was
not ready to accept that sweeping statement,
that the law officers of the Crown wouid be
influenced by the atmosphere of the building
in which they live. As a matter of fact, my
honourable friend may be surprised to hear
that the only person who seemed to have any
interest in the matter was the Law Clerk of
the Senate, who at my requeet went to see
the Deputy Minister of Justice. I do not
know Mr. Edwards, except casually, through
my contact with him in connection with the
furtherance of Senate affairs, when Mr. Justice
Newcombe happened to be away; but I have
enough confidence in the Deputy Ministers
and their sense of authority to believe that
Mr. Edwards has not been moved by any
kind of influence whatever. We are in the
habit of saying between ourselves, at times,
that Ministers are but shadows, and that the
real power is with the Deputy Ministers. I
think there is something to be said in favour
of that view.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: Is
there any high court of appeal in this case?
'CANADA EVIDENCE BILL
REFERRED TO SPECIAL COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading of Bill 27, an Act to amend the
Canada Evidence Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, we had a
discussion on this Bill which led us to postpone a final decision. You will all remember
wh
bat the Bill covers. At present a witness
can appear before a tribunal and ask to be
protected against admissions that he may give
in testimony. The law in this respect will not
be changed. The witness appearing in a
trial may ask to be protected against any
admi-sion that ha may make in connection
with an offence that he may have committed;
but he will only be protected in so far as he
may have participated in an offence. He
will not be protected if, after obtaining the
protection of the court, he commits perjury.
He may not be prosecuted for having committed perîjury in the testimony ha gave under
the protection of the court; but there is a
phrase which limits the right to prosecute
him for perjury because of the evidence that
ha gives in that very case. If, after obtaining
that protection, he commits perjury, he can
be prosecuted for that perjury; but it has
been held by the Court of Appeal in Saskat.

have stated the truth will not be set up
against him to establish his perjury in another
case.
The proposition now submitted to us is to
allow of protection being granted him whenever be is asked to testify in a case, but he
may be prosecuted for perjury upon whatever
testimony ha may have given either in that
case or in another case.
It was alleged by the honourable gentleman
from Middleton (Hon. W. B. Ross) that if
we thus leave the witness open to an action
for perjury in another case in which he may
have sworn contrary to what he swears under
protection, we are liable not to have his
testimonyv at all. The honourable gentleman
asked: "What do we obtain by giving him
protection? We obtain the advantage of his
testimony. He had the right, before, to keep
silent-to refuse to answer for fear of incriminating himself; but the statute allows
him now. under the protection of the court,
to speak freely. If, by passing this amendment, we let a witness know that although
ha would have the protection of the court for
the testimonv he now gives, ha will not have
it for the testimony he gave on a previous
day, and will be prosecuted for perjury-which
ha himself will have clearly admitted by
swearing contrarv to what he swore beforethen his lips will be closed."
That argument cannot be controverted or
weakened; it stands there; there is no question that there will be tlhat danger. But the
Department of Justice. which has seriously
examined the situation, has come to the conclusion that as between the fear that has
been expressed by the honourable gentleman
from Middleton and the danger of leaving the
witness free to perjure himself, it will be best
to recommend the present amendment to the
Act.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I am sorry that
the leader of the Government secs fit ta press
the third teading of this Bill. I am not convinced it is a good Bill, and the matter needs
a great deal of consideration. As I understand the situation, it is this. According to
English law no man is compelled to give
evidence that will convict himself. Then the
Canada evidence Act was passed. under the
terms of which a witness could not claimn the
right to refuse to answer a question which
would incriminate himself; but while that
Act compels him to answer questions the
answers to which may incriminate himself,
it gives the court the power to say to him:
"The evidence which you give on this
occasion will not be used against you in any

sense. We want a man to give evidence when

we give protection we cannot depend on the
testimony of the witness. We say if there is
only a trial for perjury he is in danger, and he
will give truthful evidence. Surely that is
nos reasonable. It does not appeal to me.

gent.lemen. I have just a word or two to say
in line with ;the suggestion made by the tonourable gentleman fron Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Me!Means). I have a great deal of confidence
in the Deputy Solicitor Generai, and respect
for his knowiledge of the law. We may differ
at t:mes, as alil lawyers do. but I doubt if this
emanated from him, and I do not suppose it
did. From a wide experience of the administration of criminal law, my opinion is that
this will not aid in the detection of and
punishment for crime, because it certainly
closes the mouth of the man who is suspected
of baving lied hefore, and now it is hotped

I venture to emphasize the very reasonable
position taken by the honourable gentleman

this clause should stand over for another Session, and that you should get the opinions of

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I think that the

that is the reason why I support the position
which the honourable member for Winnipeg

This is the way I understand the question.
The criminail comes and stands at the bar 'of
ju'stice. The judge dooks at him and says:
"We want to open your lips; whatever ýcrime
you may have commiitted in the past, you
may admit it an'd no 'prosecution will be
launched against you." But the law goes further and says: "But now you must tell the
tr th."'In other words, provided 'the criminal
tells the truth when he is called upon to
speak, everything else is forgiven. In other
words. nothing in his testimony can be used
against him.
But what are yonu going to do now? You

it stands.
You say ito him: "My friend, now you are up
you can admit anything except iperjury; if
you admit that, you wiii be prosecuted." In
other words: "W-hat you say to-day may convict you of perjury by reason of what you
have said before, and in that case you go to
prison." I do not think that is a very effective
way of obtaining the truth. Surely you want
to open his lips for the purpose of getting the
tiuth, but a menace is placed before the witness that will prevent him from speaking the
truth, because if he speaks the truth it will
send him to the penitentiary. Remembering
the law, the zman wiil say to the judge: "But,
if to-day, by telling the truth, I show that
yesterday I ilied under oath, then I go to
jail?" The juidge bas to say, "Yes." Then
the man wifi say, "Weill, I wont speak;" or,
if he does speak, he is going to tell a lie that
will save him.
It seeims to me that the laxw as it stands
to-day is very much more effective for the
purpose of the prosecution of justice; te may
admit murder, if you like, or perjury. At all
events. there is a very grave idoubt that the
law will be improved by the amendment, and
there seems to 'be no reason for haste, or why
we shouild not refleet very carefutily before
a.dopting it.

DEBATE ON MOTION FOR SECOND READING
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned dehate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Willoughby for the second reading of Bill 4,
an Act respecting divorce.
Hon. G. H. BARNARD:
Honourable
gentlemen, it is not my intention to "htain the
flouse for any great length of time in tihe
discussion of the subject-matter of this Bill.
I may say t.hat the foundation of the divorce
jurisdiiction in the Province of British
Columbia, and in the th-ree other western
Provinces, which are, I ùhink, the only Provinces affected by this Bill, is the Act known
as the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Act
of England of 1857. The laws of British
Columbia provided that the Province of

45"

British Columbia should take the law of
England as it existed in the year 1858. The
resuit was that the Divorce and Matrimonial
Causes Act was beki by the provincial court
.- and lias since been held iby the Privy
Council-to 'be in force In the Provinoe of
British Columbia. In England it was foumd
expedient to amend that Act at various times
for the puýrpose of perfecting the machinery
under which the courts work, with the resuit
that there were amendments passed in 1860,
1866, 1868, 1873 and 1884. Those, being Imperial Acte, do not apply to the Province of
British 'Columbia, and the result of that lias
been that the courts of that Province, in
exercising this particular form of jurisdiiction,
have always, laboured under a certain handicap owing to not liaving as perfect machinery
as bas been devised for the carrying out of the
work in the courts of England.
It is not ne-cessary to remind this flouse
that in 1857, when tihat Bill was framed,
woman occupied a very different position in
the body politic from. what she does at tlie
present tîme. For instance, in those days
there was no such thing as the Married
Woman's Property Act. On a woman getting
married, ail lier property became the property
of lier husband: she lost ail control over it
unless it was protected by a settlement. Today the Married Woman's Property Act protects lier in that, and she is protected in many
other particulars. To-day the woman lias the
vote, and lias 'been placed on a political
equality with man. Therefore I consider it
only fair and just that in what to lier, as to
man, ie the most important relation in life,
she should ibe placed, on a parity with man.
.This question was very fully gone into by
the Royal Committee on Marriage an.d
Divorce, which was referred to by the honcurable gentleman from Moose Jaw (Hon. Mr.
Willoughby) yesterday, and I propose very
briefly to place on record one or two of the
findings of the Committee, and a short extract
of some of the evidence upon whînli the
findings were based, as well as one or two
statements made in the flouse of Lords when
fhe amend.ment of 1923 was passed in Englond.
Thc arguments are put so mucli more
concisely and in so mucli better language than.
I could hope to put themn myseli, that 1
think to read tiem is the siortest way of
disposing of fie matter. Spcakîng of flic
practice prior to the year 1857, when diivorces
were granted by Parliament only, an.d whcn in
Parliamentary practice in England tic woman
was required to prove very muci more than
tic man in obtaining a divorce, tic report
goes on to say:

SENATE

454

They appear to have been largely influenced by the
view that the fault on the part if the woman is worse
than that on the part of the man, because ber faul
mnay introduce spurious offspring into the family, and
also by the impression that a woman may more readily
be expected to forgive an adulterous husband than
he can be expected to do if adultery be committed by
the wife.
But the position of women has entirely changed since
the days
hen the practice of private Acts of Parliament prevailed; and views expressed and acted on in
the 17th and 18th centuries are no longer entertained.
If adultery be an offence, modern thought prescribed
it equally in man and woman, and declines to credit
the idea tiat a man ouglt in duty to be less forgis ng than a woran. As to the effect on the fainily
of adulter y on the part of the man differing from that
of a nwomnan, it ias to be reoiembered, that, if we consider the tmatter in its public aspect and not solely
with reference ta the particular liusband and wife,
though the act in a man may not affect his own family,
it may affect some oter family, and that the wife,

position results. The situation is treated as meriting
legal relief, and a power is left to ber, at ber discretion,
to punish him by inflicting upon him enforced celibacy,
with the result that she has ta elect between lier own
lifelong diuse of lier natural funetions and the condonation of the offence of ber husband, which may
bave amouinted to continuons sexual intercourse with
another womoan.
There is another curious inconsistency in the present
state of the law.

That is, the law under the Act of 1857.
Rape is an offence for which a woman may obtain a
divorce. The offence against the State is greater than
in the case of mere adultery; but the offence against
the wife is the sane in both cases.

That is to say, if a man commits adultery
under circumstances amounting to rape, his
wilfe can obtain a divorce, but if those circumstances are not existent she cannot obtain
a divorce, although in both cases the offence,
so far as she peasonally is concerned, is precisely the same.
The finding of the Committee is to be
found in paragraphs 210 and 211 of the report:
In principle there can be no adequate reason why
two persons, who enter into matrimonial relationship,
should have a different standard of morality applied
ta them, and, what is perhaps more remarkable about
the difference in question is that it is not recognized
as applicable to the riglat ta judicial separation, for
either man or woran may obtain a decree of this
nature for a single act of adultery. Those who maintain that judicial separation is a greater punishment
than divorce are probably right, for the former may
inflict lifelong celibacy anrd with no right of remarriage, and the latter dues not. Thus the punishmient, which may be inflicted on a man for a single
act of adultery, may be greater than that which may
be inflicted in the case of the greater offence of continuons adultery with cruelty or desertion, though the
wife migit even in the latter case choose ta take
a decree of separation and not of divorce.
Apart froni abstract justice the strongest reason for
placing the sexes on an equality is that, where two
standards exist, there is a tendency to accept the

opinion it is impossible to maintain a different standard
of morality in the marriage relation, without creating
the impression that justice is denied to women, an
impiression that must tend to lower the respect in
which the marriage law is beld by women.

The recommendation, section 219, is:
Our conclusion is that no satisfactory solution of
the problem. which is raised as to the personal relations between husband and wife, can be found, except
by placing themo on an equal footing, and by declaring
that. whatever gronds are permitted to a husband for
his wife, the sane grounds

reasonably
actual expericice in Scotland, physical, social, pecuniary and other considerations will have their natural
effect, and lead to such rights nut being exercised, at
any rate in the great majority of cases, without such
good and sufficient reason as will meet with the
approval of relations and friends of the wife.

They specifically state in section 218:
We do not overlook the arguments fouonded on
physioloical considerations, and the different cousequences of iiammorality in one case aid in the other,
but it seeis to us that those arguments are ontweighed by the other considerations presented in this
report.

It is a very significant fact that there was
a minority report, signed by three members
of the Committee: the Archbishop of York,
Sir William Anson, and Lewis T. Dibdin. The
report itself recommended other grounds for
divorce. The minority report dissented from
it, but concurred in the recommendation that
the two sexes should be placed upon a parity.
That is to be found at page 191 of the
Minority Report:
We concur in the recommerdation of the Majority
Report that whatever grorunds are permitted to a
hiisband for obtaining a divorce fron his wife, the
same grounds slould be available for a wife in a suit
against ber husband.

The supporters of this Bill are only asking
that the wonen of the four Western Provinces
should be treated upon the same basis as
any woman who comes to the Parliament of
Canada. The practice in this Parliament has
been, ever since I have known anything of
divorce Bills--and I suppose it has always
been-that the two sexes are treated exactly
alike. The supporters if this Bill say that
there is no reason why, because those courts
happen to have a limited jurisdiction, given
to them fifty or sixty years ago, you should
place them at a disadvantage or in an inferior
position-for that is really what it amounts
to-as compared with women in the other
provinces of Canada.

JUNE 11, 1925
The division liets in both the Lords and the
Commons were significant. In the English
House of Commons this amendment was
carried by a vote of 257 ta 26. In the House
of Lords the division was: 95 contents against
8 non-contente. Among those voting for the
Bill in the House of Lords were the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of London,
the Bishop of Southwark, and two Ex-Lord
Chancellors, Lord Buckmaster and Lord
Birkenhead. I want ta quote what was said
by the Archbishop of Canterbury, speaking
on this Bill:
But we feel-at least I feel-that when we are
brought face to face with the particular issue which
is raised by this Bill we have no alternative at all.
Large as is the obligation which the Marriage Law
entails, there is in one sense a larger obligation, if
there cai be a larger obligation still, and that is the
obligation to respect the law of God as being uniform
for men and women as regards morality. If we once
admit that the law of God, as interpreted by the
best interpreters of it ta human understanding through
the centuries, bas laid it down that there is no vital
distinction in the obligation of morality between the
man and the woman, we must, so far as I can see,
support this Bill which removes an existing difference
which the law as it stands does make between the
two. It is on those grounds that I feel that I cannot
possibly do otherwise than give my support to a
measure limited, as it is, to that particular point.

Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: That is on the
Act of 1923?
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: That is on the Act
of 1923, which is this Act as affecting the
Western Provinces.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Well, is
it this Act?
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: It is this Act.
Hon. Mr. LYNCHSTAUNTON: Why is
it not drawn in the same phraseology? It is
quite different.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: The effect is exactly
the same. Here is the language of Lord
Birkenhead:
That issue is this: If a husband bas been unfaithful
to his wife, should she or should she not be afforded
the same remedy which the husband la afforded who
complains of infidelity on the part of his wife?
I
have never seen an answer ta this question. I have
never seen how anybody who believes, not necessarily
in political equality between the two sexes, but in
fair dealing by the Legislature between the two sexes,
could find an effective answer to those who argue on
behalf of this reform.

I want ta cite just one more quotation, an
authority which J think will appeal particularly ta my Liberal friends, as it is the
authority of the Right Hon. Mr. Gladstone.
He was speaking of the Bill of 1857, when an
amendment similar ta the present was
sought ta be introduced ta that measure:

455

In Committee, in the House of Commons, Mr.
Drummond moved an amendment having for its object
the establishment of the equality of the sexes, but the
Attorney-General objected, on the ground that the
Bill was to amend procedure, and the law was settled.

It should be noted that the abjection raised
by the Attorney-General, who was, I presume, in charge of the Bill, was not to the
merits, but on the ground that the Bill was
merely one ta amend procedure, and that the
law itself was settled and they were merely
giving effect ta that law.
Mr. Gladstone held that the law was not fixed. He
looked on the importation of divorce a vinculo as an
evil, but if it were to be introduced, he expressed
himself in favour of equality:
"I believe that the evil of introducing this principle
of inequality between men and women is far greater
than the evil which would arise from additional cases
of divorce a vinculo; and I take my stand, in the
first place, on this, that, if it be assumed that the
indissolubility of marriage bas been the result of the
operation of the Christian religion on earth, still
more emphatically I believe it may be assumed that
the principle of the equality of the sexes bas been

very earliest times some traces of what approaches to
it; but it is the special and peculiar doctrines of the
Gospel respecting the personal relation in which every
Christian, whether man or woman, is placed to the
person of our Lord that forin the firm, the broad,
the indestructible bdsis of the equality of the sexes
under the Christian law."

In conclusion, all I have ta say is that if
we who are in favour of this err, at least we
err in good company. I submit that this is
a Bill which in equity and in right should
receive the support of this House, and I
intend ta vote for it.
fHon. Mr. LYNCH-STATNTON: Would
the honourable gentleman be kind enough ta
answer me a question? The law of divorceis one with which I am not familiar, but I
notice that the English Act is as follows:
It shall be lawful for any wife to present a petition
to the court praying that ber marriage may be
dissolved on the ground that ber husband bas, since
the celebration thereof and since the passing of this
Act, been guilty of adultery: Provided that nothing
contained herein shall affect or take away any right
of any wife existing immediately before the passing
of this Act.

I understand that the law in British Columbia or in other provinces is identical with
what was the law of England before the
passing of that Act which I have read.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: That amendment,
yes.
Then
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
why did we not copy the English Act in
this Bill? It seems ta go far beyond the
English law.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I can only say ta
my honourable friend that I have never even

456

SENATE

spoken to the mover of this Bill in the House
of Commons, the honourable member for
Calgary. I do not know why he drew it in
the way he has done. I read the Bill and
was convinced in my own mind that it was
satisfactory.
Hon. N. A. BELCOURT: Honourable gentlemen, may I say at once that in the observations which I am going to submit I shall
not obtrude any personal, religious or conscientious principles, beliefs, convictions, or
scruples, or whatever you may call them. I
intend to deal with the question exclusively
from the point of view of law, the natural law
and the requirements of social order.
In the discussions that have taken place
in Parliament, in the publie press and elsewhere on the question of divorce, we have
almost entirely lost sight of the fundamentals,
of the essential considerations which ought
to apply to marriage and divorce. We have,
I am afraid, been content to devote our
efforts and considerations to the people who
have contracted unfortunate unions. Ii our
desire to come to the rescue of those who
have made a bargain which has turned out
badly for themselves, we have, almost constantly and almost universally, overlooked
those higher interests of society, of the family
and of the offspring of marriage.
It may be that in this country the reason
is to be found in the fact that, so far as
Parliament, at all events, is concerned, there
has never been any real discussion of the
merits or demerits of divorce. No Bill or
proposal dealing with the question of divorce
generally has ever been submitted to us. It
is truc that we have to deal with Bills of
Divorce, and such Bills are granted every
year. but the divorces recommended by our
Divorce Committee are exceptional cases;
they are exceptions to the general law. We
have had no general provision for divorce.
We have dealt with the matter merely and
exclusively with reference to the particular
cases that have corme before us. Now. if I
may be permitted, I would like to endeavour
to state these fundamentals in regard to
natural law and social order.
It is a mistaken idea that power to legislate
can be exercised without due observance of
the obligations and sanctions of natural law,
and the imperious necessities of social order.
On the contrary, the power to legislate is
and always must be subordinated to and in
conformity with the laws of nature. For the
good of society, the observance of natural law
is a fundamental necessity in order to insure
the preservation and progress of the social
order. The duties and obligations of parents
have their sources in natural law, and the
amm.Mr. BARNARD.

performance of these is necessary not only
for the good of the family, upon which society
rests, of which it is the fundamental basis,
but for society itself. The duty of parenthood to its offspring permeates the whole
of creation, from man down to the lowest
order, and truth compels one to admit that
the whole of the animal creation, outside of
man, seldom fails to accomplish its dictates.
The interest of the State in the offspring,
its citizens, is of the highest importance because the stability and progress of the human
race and of civilization are in direct proportion to the development, and the physical
and mental acquisitions of its subjects. It
is the duty of the State, because it is in the
interest of good Government, peace and order
and sound policy, to encourage and promote
the establishment and stability of marriage,
and at the same time, and by the same
reasoning, to oppose in every conceivable way
the breaking up or destruction of the family.
Divorce is the greatest destroyer of the
family. When the family is broken up, society
suffers because the children are very insufliciently provided for, when they are not
absolutely ignored. Because the State has
an immediate and direct interest in the bringing up of its citizens, it has a manifest duty
in assuring the performance of the contract
entered into between the parties, and ought,
because of this interest, to insist upon the
complete execution of the duties so assumed.
The State, as is well recognized the world
over, has a clear duty to encourage, foster
and promote marriage; and, as a corollary of
this duty, a further duty of maintaining,
preserving and protecting marriage, and
especially to prevent the breaking up of the
fanily by divorce.
Marriage, whether considered as a sacrament
or merely as a civil contract, whether viewed
one way or another, whether we consider it
mciely as a legal or civil marriage, is in every
case a contract, like any other contract,
having the full force and binding effect
of contracts sanctioned by law.
It
is
a
contract by
which the contracting
parties assume certain responsibilities, all
the
obligations
which result from the
contract, whether stipulated in so' many
vords in the contract or whether arising
out of natural law. It is a contract, not for
a day, but forever, until death; a contract
not to last only so long as it may please one
or other of the united parties; a contract not
determinable at will by either or even both
of the parties; a contract for better or for
worse; a contract from whieh arise and are
created vested rights, first on the part of

J1JNE 11, 1925
each of the contracting parties as against one
another, then on behaif of the children who
are to be born from the union, and finally on
behalf of society, or the community of which
the contracting parties form part, and under
whose protection thýis contract is to, be guarded
and performed. It is a contract which, none
of the parties should be allowed to break in
any way because of these vested riglits so
acquired by children, on the one hand, and by
organized society on the other.
It is a new theory altogether, which has
neyer been applied to any other kind of
contract, that througli divorce the marriage
contract can be broken, even for those who
have acquired under it vested riglits; a
theory by which the vested riglits of chidren
and society, thougli neither has in any way
committed any breach, can be wiped out
hecauqse one of the parties to it lias tired of
kceping it, because of the whim or desire of
one of the contracting parties. A marriage
contract, whether viewed as both a sacrament
and a civil contract, or merely as a simple
civil contract, is to ail intents and purposes,
a contract flot only authorized, but encouraged
by ýlaw, by good policy and common sense,
and, finally, in coniformity with natural law.
Like aIl other contracta it creates vested
riglits. What other kind of contract,' under
whicli vested riglits have been acquired is
Fvllowcd to be broken at the will or whim of
one of the parties thereto?
The only ground urged by those who dlaim
that this solemn contract may be broken is
that it bas become difficult of execution; that
the contracting parties have made their lives
more or less miserable through the contract;
that the contract has become a burden,'
ls there any other kindf of contract which etc.
.the
law permits to be broken because it lias liecorne irksome or difficult of performance by
one or the other of the contracting parties?
Why allow the most sacred and solemn of ahl
contracta, and the most binding, even from the
point of view of law and because of its consequence to society, to, le more easily destroyed and dcfeated than a contract involving
a mere matter of trade or commerce, or even
a mere chattel? Yet it is unfortunateýly
true,
and almost universally so, that the sacred
character of marriage, its indissolubiity, the
necessity of maintaining it intact and preserving it from the many dangers with which
it is confronted, lias become, in the estimation of so many, an old-fashion idea. This
sentiment lias become so wide spread and so
general that, with the present generation,
marriage is nothing but a mere lark, and
pretty nearly every atom of its spiritual

meaning and character lias disappeared.
Divorce is inspired and prompted almost
always by a desire for change, for the purpose of securing another companion.
The state lias rushed in and multiplied the
opportunities and facilities for indulging sucli
whim or desire for change. It lias been stated
by competent authority that, counting certain
duplications, there are now 363 different causes
for obtaining divorce recoguized by the Courts
in the United States and many other countries.
How can. organized society or community
endure if this is allowed to go on; if the very
foundation of society, the family, is undermined, broken up, and destroyed under sucli
pretexts?
The present state of affairs in
several of the great countries of the world
arnounts to nothing but camouflaged polygainy anid polyandry."
The state is a party to the marriage contract. It lias encouraged it. It lias undertaken and promised to protect it, and
especially society, and the chuldren to be born.
What disposition or principle of natural law
authorizes the State to, break up this contract at the request of one or other of the
parties thereto, and thus wipe out the vested
riglits acquired by the children and by society?
The paramount duty of both parent and State
is to produce the best of citizens for the sake
of the state or society, as well as for the
sake of the family.
It is claimed that the question of divorce
was settled by the Act of Confederation.
That contention I presume, is based upon
the provision of Section 92 of the B.N.A. Act,
which assigns to the Dominion the exclusive
legislative power as to "marriage and divorce."
It is apparent that this lias settled nothing as
to the nature of any divorce which might bie
enacted. It did not, and does not, imply the
necessity or show propriety of any special
divorce law being put forth.
It certainly
does not imply that the Dominion Legislature
shaîl grant divorce, nor that it may not prohibit divorce absolutely and in ahl cases. It
is perfectly consistent with that power of the
Dominion Parliament ta refuse to grant
divorce for any cause, or under any circumstances. Parliament miglit just as weIl have
decreed that there would lie no divorce, and,
as a matter of fact, that is the position in
which Parliament really stands, since Parliament lias neyer passed a general divorce law.
Divorces granted in Canada by Parliament,
and by tlie Courts which have jurisdiction,
have not that safeguard or precaution which
is offered in all other countries, and espeeially
in the United States of America, wliere
divorces can lie had merely for the asking.

absolute for divorce cannot be secured except
after a delay varying from 6 months to 3
years.
In other words, for six months and
up to three years, in certain cases, the parties
who have asked for a divorce, and in favour
of whom a decree has been granted, cannot remarry. But here in Canada either party may
coie to this Parliament and get a divorce,
and re-marry the very next day after the
divorce is granted and be properly within the
law.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I always understood
that a decree nisi was granted, and a delay
made, so that if there was any collusion
between the parties it could be shown.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
No, not merely
that, but it is in order to give them an
opportunity for repenting.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:

No.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I say that is one
of the reasons why the decree nisi is not to
be executed until after a delay of from six
months to three years.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: It is six months in
England. There is a decree made, and it
becomes absolute in six months unless it can
be shown that there has been collusion.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I beg pardon: if
it can be shown that the parties have not got
together it is made absolute.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I think the decree
nisi was made in order to give the King's
Proctor six months' time after the case came
up in which there could be intervention, and
if he intervened and proved misconduct on
the part of either of the parties, the decree
would never be made absolute.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I think everyone
will agree with me that if, in the time fixed
by the law, the parties represented got together there would be no decree absolute, in
the United States or anywhere else.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
How could that
be-that they would remarry?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: They cannot remarry within that time. What I want to
point out is that in a country where divorce
is even more easily obtained than here, there
is a provision and precaution, and something
which we have not got the benefit of, that is,
that there must be a delay between the time
of the decree nisi is pronounced and the
time when the married people could remarry,
whereas here in Canada we grant divorce
to-day, and the parties can go and get married
the very next day.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
That would
not apply under this Bill, which only deals
with provinces in which the wife has not

covers. They all have the order nisi about
which you speak.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I am trying to
show that so far as Canada is concerned the
practice which we adopted in dealing with
divorce leaves us no better off than the worst
country where divorce has full sway.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
best of them.

Or the

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Well, the best, if
that suits my honourable friend, or easiest,
if you like. I say that a party to a divorce
in Canada can get married the day after
getting the divorce. I do not think there is
any other country in the world where that is
the case. We claim that we are in a better
position-at least, that we have protected
marriage to a great extent because we have
limited the possibility of divorce to two
causes-adultery and cruelty. Now, cruelty
is a thing almost impossible to define. I
doubt if there are half-a-dozen men who would
agree upon a classification or gradation of
cruelty.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The courts
have.
By granting
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
divorce for cruelty I think you have admitted
that divorce can be granted for any one of
the 363 causes to which I have referred.
According to the old proverb, "Cruelty covers
a multitude of sins"-and probably it is more
truc of divorce than of anything else.
Let me point out that in Ireland there is
very much less divorce than there is any other
country in the world-something like one case
in five years--because divorced persons are
not allowed to remarry. The same may be
said of the Province of Quebec. You never
hear of divorce among the Catholic people of
the Province of Quebec; yet they have a way
of getting over the difficulty by separation
alone.
That brings me to a serious reason for my
strong opposition to this Bill. This Bill will unquestionably increase very considerably the
number of divorces in Canada, this Bill, if
passed, will sanction the detestable doctrine,
the fatal doctrine, that the most sacred, the
most solemn, the most important of all contracts, involving the most important and the

.TUNE 11, 1925
most sacred of vested rights, can be whol'ly
and finally wiped out in order to satisfy the
mere wish or whim or passion of one whose
contraet for better or for worse bas failed to
turn out for the better. Shall we apply that
doctrine to ail contracts, public or private?
If we are to preserve consistency, and to be
logical, we must; but if we do, how long wilI
the family, and social order, and civilization
endure?

This goes to show, as far as suicide is concerned, the awful consequences upon society
which divorce bas brought about.
We must not look only at the sufferiugs or
the difficulties that have comne to those who
have contracted an unfortunate marriage: we
must not allow aur compassion anid sympathy
ta carry us away. There ax~e real cansequences, very serious consequeuces, whioth
divorce entails upon saciety. I ask hanourable
gentlemen in alI seriousness whether, if the
divorces in the United States--which are now
10 per cent of the marriages-contintie ta
inôrease, is it possible for that nation to
survive? Is it possible to think that the social
order of that country is goiug te be maintained, and that civilization is going to survive? I submit that if divorce i.s not limited
the outlook for society is very poor wherever
divorces have grown to such an exteut. AIthough we have granted many less divorces
per thousaud of our population than have been
granted in the United States, we have laid a
foundation for a similar state of thiugs; and,
insteadof eudeavouriug to fiud reason for increasing the number, I thiuk it is the manifest duty of Parliament to endeavour to put
a stop to this fatal practice.

CUSTOMS BILL
SECOND

READING

Hlon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 145, ani Act ta amend the
Customs Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the smuggling of gonds into Canada has, been increasing
until it has reached very large proportions
and is operating to the detriment of legitimnate
trade. For this reason there is an insistent
publie demand at the present time that
strenunus efforts be made ta suppress this
practice, and it is felt that to do so it is
necessary ta impose beavier penalties for
offenees and ta add new penalties to those at
precent provided by The Customs Act.
The two main sections of the Act dealing
wîth smuggling and transactions in smuggled
gonds are 206 and 219, and it is these Sections
with which the present Bill deals.
Under section 206 as it stands at present,
the penalty for smuggling is forfeiture of the
gonds if found, or if nlot found, forfeiture of
a stîm in addition equal to the value of the
gonds, to be recavered by suit. A further
penalty is provided on summary conviction
before Justices of the Peace nat exeeeding
$200 and not less than $50, or imprisonment
for a term net exceeding one year and not
bazs thin anc month, or bath fine and imprisoriment.
In the proposaI Bill these penalties are
increased.
Where the gonds smuggled are
tînder $200 the penalties remain as at present,
e-xcept that the penalties are stated to be
without power of remissian. When the gonds
are axer the value of $200 the affence is
made indictable, bearing a term of imprisanment from one ta seven years for the flrst
offence and fram three ta ten years far the
second and subsequent affences, in addition
ta the forfoiture of the goods or a snm equal
ta the value thereaf.
Section 219 deals with the keeping or selling
of gonds unlawfully imported. The praposed
Bill makes this an indictable offence where
goods so held are over the value of $200,
bearing penalties of imprisonment for the
same terms as under Section 206.
The
penalty of forfeiture of the goods or value
thereof is alsa made withaut power of remission.
It is felt that at the present time many
persans wbo are not themselves guilty of
smtîggling do deal in gaods which they know
ta be smuggled. and that the imposing of a
more severe penalty for these affences will
have a salutary effeet.
Undýer the Customs Act, section 177, the
Minister in bis decision respecting a seizure

JUNE 12, 1926
is empowered to fix terms upon which the
thing seized or detained may be released, or
the penalty or forfeiture remitted.
This
power of remission has led to the bringing of
pressure upon the Minister from various
quarters to influence lenient treatment. When
it is known that the Minister no longer has
that, power the penalties imposed will act as
an added deterrent. There is a further power
of remission by the Governor in Council,
provided by section 92 of the Audit Act. The
proposed amendment will prevent remission
by Council of penalties for the offences
described. This it is felt will have a further
deterring effect and will be notice to all
persons engaged in smuggling or harbouring
smuggled goods that the penalties laid down
in this new section will be rigidly enforced.
I bellieve that all the legitimate trade of
this country will welcome these amendments.
Numerous delegations of men who have invested their capital and are conducting an
honourable business in this country have come
to the Government to complain of the illegal
and cruel competition that they were meeting
in the Canadian market through smuggling.
At the same time, this of course entails a
loss to the Treasury. I think the moment is
opportune to strike hard at the transgressor.
The coming of the motor car has created a
strong temiptation to carry valuable goods
across the border, and I hope that this legislation will bc carried unanimously in this
Chamber.
Hon. J. D. REID: Having been Minister of
Customs for a number of years, I take perhaps
a littile more interest in this Bill than many
other members of this honourable body. I am
in favour of very severe punishment for
smuggling, and I do not wish any remarks
that I may make to be interpreted as a desire
on my part that smuggling should be increased. The law as we have it is very severe.
Any person caught smuggling has his goods
confiscated, and the vessel or vehicle in which
the goods are carried seized. That is a pretty
severe punishment; but, in addition to that,
as has been stated by the honourable leader
of the Government, he is liable on summary
conviction before two justices of the peace to
a penalty not exceeding $200 and not less
than $50 or to imtprisonment for a term not
exceedipg one year and not less than one
month, or to both fine and imprisonment.
I have no objection whatever to increasing
the penalty along these lines; I have no objection to making the term of imprisonment
as long as the Government wishes to make it;
and, while I may say at the outset that some
of the amendments I have no objection to, I

461

do object to the proposed amendment containeld in subsection 3 of section 1 of this Bil:
Everyone who smuggles or clandestinely introduces
into Canada any goods subject to duty of the value
of $200 or over is guilty of an indictable offence and
liable in addition to any other penalty to which lie
is subject for any such offence to imprisonment for
a terni not exceeding seven years and not less than
one year for a first offence, and to imprisonment
for a term not exceeding ten years and not less than
three years for a second and each subsequent offence,
an' such goods, if found, shall be seized and forfeited
without power of remission, or if not found but the
value thereof has been ascertained the person so
offending shall forfeit without power of remission the
value thereof as ascertained.

Now, here is the important part of it:
4. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1028 of
the Criminal Code, or of any other statute or law,
thc court shall upon any proceeding by indictment
under subsection 3 hereof-

-That

is the clause I have just read-

-have no power to impose less than the minimum
penalties therein prescribed, and shall in all cases
of conviction impose both fine and imprisooment.

Thus an individual who happend to have
goods of the value of over $200 is placed in
the position of a criminal.
Up to the present time I do not think the
public has looked upon this offence in that
way. What strikes me as unfair is that an
accused person has no right of appeal. Under
the Customs law even after trial and conviction, there is an appeal to the Supreme Court
of Canada. I claim that it is only British
justice to allow such a person to go before
a court of appeal. I have made inquiries
from those who will administer this law and
I know they are not in favour of it; but the
agent of the protective association Must earn
his money and he has been working up this
case and sending letters to every member of
Parliament and as many Senators as he
could reach, in the hope of making a let
of criminals out of people who would not
knowingly do an unjust thing.
I know of men who have large businesses,
and who have a clerk to make out the custorns
entries. Sometimes such clerk will make false
entries andi perhaps take part of the money
that should be paid for duty. I understand
that in such a case, if the offence were discovered the Customs officials would hold the
employer responsible, and he would be liable
to go to the penitentiary. Under this law
he could not avoid that punishment in case
of his clerk making a false entry.
If there happened te be in the Custom
House an enemy of an individual and a
complaint were laid, the person responsible
for a false entry must go to jail and his
family and himself would be disgraced,
though he never intended any wrong action.

462

SENATE

Then there are cases of individuals coming into this country not knowing that there
is a duty on what they bring in. People who
go South during the winter may buy $300 or
$400 worth of clothing, and may believe that,
having worn that clothing for a short time,
they can bring it in without paying duty;
but under this law an officer would seize
the goods and send those people to penitentiary.
When I was minister of Customs one of
the most prominent citizens of Montreal
would have been sent tc penitentiary under
this Act. He bought an automobile from the
Hudson people in Montreal and asked to
test the motor by taking a trip with his
family through the United States. He paid
the price of the automebile deducting the
amount of duty, which he agreed to pay
when coming in again through Rouse's point,
or near there. The Hud-son people deducted
the amoun of duty that they would have
had to pay; but as they bring in motor cars
at manufacturers' nrices the purchaser was
asked te pay the duty on the price in the
United States. He objected and the result
was that the automobile was seized. The
Customs officer was delighted to get hold
of the party; I 'think he had some grievance
against him. When the matter came before
me it was explained that there was no intention of doing any wrong, and, as the purchaser
of the au omobile did not hesitate to pay the
balance of the duty, there was no further
trouble about it; but under this clause that
party would be punished for making a false
entry and he would have no right of appeal.
Therefore this clause. if enacted, would make
criminals out of individuals who never intended to commit a wrong for the judge who
tries a case must convict, the clause being
so worded that there is no alternative.
I suggest that this is such an important Bill
that it should be laid over until Monday, so
that honourable gentlemen could think it
over and consider whether it is fair to the
citizens of this country. A former Minister of
Customs opposed this clause in the other
House, not thinking it was workable or just,
and my candid opinion is that the present
Minister, if he were in bis place, woulid not
bring in such a Bill as this. I am not reflecting on the Acting Minister, who has his own
Department to administer, and who introduced this measure after it had been prepared by his officials.
I do not object to making the laws as
strong as possible, or inflicting fines as large
as tbe Government may think fit; but this
clause changes the present Act so thaît the
Hon. Mr. REID.

Minister bas net power to be lenient even
when circumstances permit. When I was Minister, if a man came before me whom I knew
to be innocent of any intention to defraud the
Government, I woul say: "Pay the balance
of the duty, and everything wi-il be satisfactory." I never ha.d any trouble in matters
of this kind. I do not ithink it is fair not to
allow leniency in 'cases that are clearly not
criminal; nor is it right to reflect on the
Minisber or the Department officials by saying that influences can be put on them so
that one individual will be let off more easily
than another.
I do net wish to agitate for any law that
will alilow an increase in smuggling. I beflieve
that if there is smuggling of automobiles, or
goods of any kind, the parties should be prosecuted, but let us have British justice, and
let the parties be brought before a court
and have the case tried fairly and honestly,
and let us give the parties the right to appeal
to the Supreme Court if desired. Do not
class such persons as criminal when it is
shown that they never intended to do
a
criminal act. I defy the leader of the Government to produce a statement from any
country in the worild that has a clause like
this in its Customs legislation. The United
States would net put such a, clause into their
Customs Act.
I appeal again to the honourable leader to
let this Bill stand over so that honourable
members may have a chance to read and consider it carefulily, and then, if the House
wishes to pass the Bill, I have no objection,
as far as I am concerned.
Hon. Mr. LYNO-ST:AUNTON: Honourable gentlemen, in my opinion this legislation
is unparallelied. What are we dealing with?
The evasion of payment of Customs duties;
and it is now proposed to place the punishment for such evasions higher than that for
any crime under the laws of this country. If
it iis such a heinous crime to evade the customs duties, why is it not as heinous te evade
the ineome tax? Why is it considered that
a person who evades this law should be subject to penitentiary for 'three years, and that
under no condition should a judge have
power to suspend the sentence?
It is one of the well-recognized practices
that have obtained throughout the history of
the administration of British criminal law that
a tribunal should be allowed to consider the
surrounding circumsttances, and whether or
not, even in the most serious offences, there
was not some extenuating circumstances which
entitled the accused te the consideretion of
the court. But here we propose to deprive

JUNE 12, 1925
the judges, against most of whom no reproach
can be brought, of that wise and proper discretion which has been entrusted to them. We
think that the law would be better administered if it were made inexorable. We know
that what occasioned miscaýrriages of justice
in ithe olden time was the horrible rigor cf the
law. If you went before 'a jury with a case
of this kind, and competent counsel were engaged, who pointed out to the jury that the
judge on the bench had no authority to temper justice with mercy, had no right te do
anything but consign to the penitentairy a
man whom they knew in ,their hearts had no
intention of doing wrong, do you suppose the
jury would not be tempted to disregard their
duty? The law is propedly administered because juries know, and counsel can point out,
that the Crown will exercise the prerogative
of mercy in a ýproper case, that the judge will
exercise his discretion in such a case, where,
although a man may be technically guilty, he
is not morally culpable. But all that is to be
swept away, net in the interest of the state,
but in the interest of the trader.
I say that this is introducing into our law
a. bad policy, something which will defeat the
proper administration of justice, and perhaps
inflict very severe hardships. I am told that
the law is this--that a man who comes into
the country and passes through the customs
gate, who is not asked any questions, and who
is not aware of what the law is--because
although we are presumed to know the law
many of us do net know it, and very few of
us know anything about the Customs statute
-is allowed to pass through the gate but
when he bas got through the Customs officer
runs after him and finds that he bas a dutiable
article in his possession. Although he had not
been asked any question about it, and did not
realize that there was any duty upon it, yet he
discovers that he is liable to al the penalties.
You must remember that this Bill applies
not only to the man who slips through under
cover of darkness, or where there is no Customs
officer, or to the man who tells a lie te the
Customs officer, saying, "I have no dutiable
article." It applies aIso to people te whom
the 'Customs officer, after looking through
their baggage, may say, "You are all right,"
and whose goods he may then seize because
they have not made a declaration of what
is dutiable. Any honourable member in this
Chamber would be amazed at the conditions
under which a man may be considered guilty.
There are so many intricacies in such cases
that I think it would be a horrible injustice
to take away the right of the Crown or the
right of the Court to suspend sentence.

463

You must remember also that Customs
officers share in the penalty. An informer,
as I understand the Customs Act, gets half
the penalty. They may deliberately allow a
man te go through and may seize him after
he bas passed. When there is no power to
remit, although it may be established to the
satisfaction of the Collector of Customs that
the officer deliberately let the man through,
the Crown has no alternative, but is bound
to impose the penalty.
What is the reason for this amendment?
Do we find that justice is se scandalously
administered in this country that the Crown
remits penalties and exercises the prerogative
of mercy unjustly, improperly and against
public policy? I never heard of it in my
life. I never heard the Customs Department
even accused of favoritism or improper conduct. This is more than an impropriety. It
is a reflection upon the Minister of Customs,
upon the Government and upon the administration of Justice. For my part, I am quite
in faveur of any increase of penalties, but I
think that the gates should always be left
open for a judge te exercise bis discretion or
for the Crown to exercise the prerogative of
mercy.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable
gentlemen, I for one cannot think that the
officer who drafted this Bill has given te it
the consideration which it deserves. Its effect
bas been shown very clearly by the two
honourable members who have preceded me.
But it would have another result. It would
defeat the ends of justice, because if a
person is found guilty and the judge bas no
alternative, but must send him te prison, the
judge will very often hesitate to apply the
law; and, in the second place, you would in
some instances make of your Customs
officers, if they are net of the right stamp,
blackmailers. A person may be allowed to
pass who bas brought from Paris a dress for
his wife. and although it bas cost less than
$200 in Paris, it may be valued here in the
Canadian market at $200. An officer may
say te that man: "Yeu will pay through the
nose, or I will send you to jail," or, what
would be still worse, "I will send your wife
to jail."
You bring in this Bill because a small
amount of duty bas been wrongfully kept from
the State. You are placing the man who is
guilty of depriving the State of perhaps $30
or $40 on the same footing as the man who
bas been guilty of a heinous crime such as
theft or manslaughter. Is it reasonable to
put the two classes of offence side by side?

Honourable
gentlemen, human beings are full of contradictions. Yesterday we listened to a debate on

against that principle, and that it is innate in
man and woman to bring in goods from one
country ta another.

small sums on articles that they carry from one
side of the line ta the other, and who are
treated practically as they were under the old
lawHon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Where is
the distinction made between them?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The distinction
is in clause 3, which strikes at the men who
are robbing this country of its legitimate customs dues and robbing legitimate trade of a
fair chance of survival.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Would my
honourable friend point out the inadequacy
of the present law? If it cannot be enforced.
how can this be enforced? We all know that
the customs penalties to-day are extraodinarily
heavy.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
They are not
sufficiently heavy to deter some men, who are
ready ta take a chance of violating the laws
of the land.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Are they
as a general rule detected in the violation of
the customs law? That is the point.

lion. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: By whom?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Very often they
are not 'detented at the frontier. Within the
last thirty days detectives have succeeded in
laydng their hands on stocks of silks which
were being carried from one place to another
in the city of iMontreal in order that they
might be distributed to retailers. There were
thousands ni dollars worth of goods. When
the truck was surrounded these men jumped
at the throats of the detectives, pulled out
revolvers and fired at them. They are today in jail.

lIon. Mr. DANDURAND:
-as

in hand, possibly, with the smuggler.
Delegations composed of men of high standing have come to Ottawa-I have received
delegates myself from Toronto, Winnipeg,
Hamilton and Montreal-stating that their
whole trade was being disorganized; that they
were paying 25 or 35 per cent duty on their
goods, and were being met with the competition
of those who had smuggled high-olass goods,
silks and other textiles, into this country.
They seemed to be discouraged as to the
future. If honourable gentlemen who are protesting against the severity of this law had
heard those princes of commerce, I am sure
they would not treat so lightly the legislation
now before us.
I draw the attention of honourable gentlemen to the fact that the amendment divides
into two classes the people who may violate

Hon. Mir. REID: Under the present law
they can be sent to jail or to the penitentiary.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There has been
such a general movement toward-s ;the violation of the Customs law in order to obtain
large profits, since the introduction of the
automobile, which was unknown when the law
was being administered by my honourabie
friend from 'Grenville (Hon. M-r. Reid), that
the hand of justice must come down heavily
upon the transgressors. If we increase the
penalties, and show the men who are now
taking the risks thet they can be landed in
the penitentiary for seven years, that will be
a considerable deterrent.
I will not say anything further, but wiUl

that would exempt that célass of touriste or
travellers f ound on our boats and transportetion systems, who go Vo and fro between the

Vo me that if there were su-ch a clause as I

H-on. Mr. DANDURAND: I mxay say, honourable gentlemen, that I welcome ahil this
criticism. The Senate is doing its duty in

Hon. Mr. REID: W.ith ail due respect to
the Cornmittee on Banking and Commerce, I
think this is such an important Bill thaît the
Iluse as a whole should hear the discussion.
The hanourahle the leader of the Governinent
,could have an officiai of tihe Department on
the floor of the House.
As the honourable the leader on this side of
the House bas said, there are a great many
tourists carming into this country, and they
may have a 'littie fruit, or something of that
kind, ýupon which t'hey do not think there is
any duty. The honourable the Leader of
the Goverament knows that the informer
receives 25 per cent, or it xnay be more than
that now, of the fine imposed, and there are
some offleers who would like nothing better
tha-n to obta.in, their share of the fine. This
would have tihe effect of driving a lot of
tourists away from the country. F'uTthermore,
this is going to !affect poor people very
seriously. There are a good many poor
people who corne in with some small article,
and under this provision there would be a
fine of not less than $50 imposed, and~ they
rnight not be able to pay it and the minister
not having any power at ail in the matter,
they would have to go to j ail, a'lthougih perhaps they thýought they were doing nothing
wrong. At many places along the border on
the Prairie ýthere is not a custorns officer
within 200 miles. People go to the other side
and probably buy a f ew groceries and. bring
them back. If the ýanount ran Vo over $200 for
a month or so, they would have Vo go to the
penitentiary, or if it wa8 less tha~n that, they
would' be fined $200. We may lose a few
dollars in C.ustoms duty, but we will save the
expense of a lot of Customs officers. These
are things which I think the Leader of the
Government shoulti consider, and see if it is
not better Vo have the Bill stand over rather
than go Vhrough in the dying diays of the
Session when we have not tirne to get it
before the Committee and go into it
thoroughly.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I arn sorry I
cannot comply with the request of m.yhonourable friend. Really, a situation has developed
that must be coped with. I arn offering to
send the Bill to the Comxnîttee on Bainking
and Commerce so'thazt we may have Vhe
officers of the Deipartment 'befors us.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOIJGHEED: Ail right,
we can take up the corrective clause then.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: May I
suggest that the law be left as it is now, and
that clauses be added Vo modify it so as to

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill

GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES COMPENSATION FOR INJURIES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 167, an Act to amend
an Act to provide Compensation where
Employees of His Majesty are killed or suffer
injuries while performing their duties.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, an Act
was passed, in 1918 to provide compensation
where employees of His Majesty were killed
or suffered injuries while performing their
duties. This was done to cover the case of
employees on the Intercolonial railway, which
was then being absorbed by the Canadian
National railway. The Act provided that the
employees would come under the Provincial
Compensation Act, and referred to the compensation being granted to them. It has been
found that the word "compensation" in the
Act is not wide enough to include medical
and hospital expenses.
The subsection repealed requires any employee who is a contributor ta the Provident Fund and who becomes permanently
disabled while on duty to elect whether he
will take the benefits of the Intercolonial and
Prince Edward Island Railways Employces'
Provident Fund Act or the benefits of the
Provincial Workmen's Compensation Act. The
repeal of subsection 4, will permit such an
employee to enjoy the benefits of both Acts.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Does that
mean that he can get the benefits of those
Acts?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, because the
Provident Fund Act was an Insurance Act
under which the employee contributed, while
the Compensation Act, which was passed in
1918. did not call for any contribution from
the employee. That is the reason why these
amendments are sought. I will explain them
more fully in Committee.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
He is freed from contribution?
He is not to
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
pay contributions under the Federal Act of
1918, but he had contributed under the Provident Fund Act prior to 1918, and he will be
entitled to the benefits that accrue to him
under that Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

RWght Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Will there be repaid to him what he has
contributed from 1919 on?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I am not sure
that he continued to pay after 1918. I will
obtain that information for the Committee
stage.
Hon. Mr. REID: When the Bill of 1918
was passed, the intention was that in every
Province the employees of the railways
should be entitled to have their cases settIed
by the Compensation Board of the Province.
Does this change that in any way?
ion. Mr. DANDURAND:
Not at all;
the railway employees are under the same
Acts-the provincial Acta.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: This Bill does not
seem to me to involve any of those matters.
.Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGU.EED: Only hospital expenses.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill was
read the second time.
POST OFFICE EMPLOYEES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 168, an Act to amend the
Civil Service Act, 1918, respecting certain
Post Office Employees.
He sa-id: The object of this Bill is to
enable the Civil Service Commission to appoint experienced employees of Postmasters
of offices paid by percentage on revenue,
when the status of such offices is changed to
the staff basis. It will, for all practical purposes, be a re-enactment of section 12 of
chapter 8 of the statutes of 1910, but modified
in such a way as to make the procedure regarding appointments to the Civil Service,
conform to the procedure at present in effect,
that is, on certificate of the Civil Service
Commission.
In Post Offices where the Postmaster is
paid by percentage on revenue, the Postmaster
is required to employ and pay whatever assistance is necessary ta properly carry on the
work. In staff Post Offices all the employees,
including the Postmaster, are paid from Parliamentary Appropriation, in accordance with
the Civil, Service classification.
The effect of this Bill will be to allow the
Civil Service Commission to appoint as employees of staff post offices persons who have
been engaged in what are known as revenue
post offices which are being changed to thestaff basis.

HOME BANK DEPOSITORS RELIEF
BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of BLill 182, an Acet for the relief of the
Depositors of the Home Bank of Canada.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this Bill
providcs for the payment of part, about 35 per
cent, of the deposits appearing at the credit
of depositors in the Home Bank when it
closed its doors on the l7th day of August,
1923. I will endeavour to be concise in explaining the facts, and to go to the kernel of
the question as summarily as possible.
This money grant is based not on a legal
right, but on a moral dlaim in equity; in other
words, it is an equitable and just claim unrecoverable at law. As every honourable
member of the Senate knows, the Bank Act
does not provide a Government guarantee of
deposits. Prior to the hast revision of the
Act, in 1923, it did provide certain safeguards,
most of which proved futile and illusory when
the management was in the hands of incompetent or dishonest people. Under the Act
before the last revision the Finance Department could easily be deceived. I behieve that
the last amendmentÀs to the Bank Act constitute a vast improvement in this respect.
We have so elaborated the returns made
monthly to the Department of Finance that
the many loop-holes that existed previously
have, I behieve, been closed. We have, besîdes,
instituted an inspectorship whýich should
furnish the necessary security, such as did
not exist under the old Act.
Have the Home Bank depositors a moral
dlaimi justifying- compensation from the public
Trea-sury? I lay down the proposition that
each case must stand separately and be
judged on its monits. We had before us in
1914 a similar demand on the Part Of the
depositors of the Farmers' Bank. A moral
dlaim at that time was urged, based on the
issuance by the Treasury Board of a certificate
given uponu the declaration that the necessary
deposit had been made according to law. It
turnýed Out that the declaratiýon which had
been filed was, according to the ternis of the
Act, untrue. The capital had been constituted
in part by the proceeds of notes. Was this
initial defect sufficient to constitute, four
years later, a moral dlaim in equity on the

471

part of the depositors for reimbursement?
The Senate at the time answered in the
negative.
I amn not prepared to say that ail of the
mai ority at that time were actuated by the
saine reason. I can only speak for myself. I
stated at the time that that initial defeet had
been cured-and it was so admitted-by the
notes having been paid at maturit-y; and I
asked the Senate what subsequent period in
a bank's existence was nýeeded to remedy such
an initial defeet. I had known of banks--and
I stated so at the time-that had been in
existence for 25 years and had prospered, but
whose license had been obtain-ed on a deceptive statement that the capital had been
paid in full, whereas it had been, as in the
case of the Farmers' Bank, paid partially by
notes. In the course of the discussion I
questioned whether in the case of a banik
which, after developing and prospering for
years, had been compelled, through mismanagement or for some cause unknown, to close its
do-ors, the depositors eould allege an initial
defeet such as that which I have mentioned.
My answer was in the negative. I feit that, the
Farmners' Bank having proceeded on its way
for four years, and that initial defect having
been cured by the payment of the notes, there
was no moral dlaim in equity against the
public Treasury on that score.
Sir William Meredith, who was appointed
to examine into the case of the Farmýers'
Bank, stated in the course of his remarks and
conclusion:
Notwitý'hstaaiding the irregularities on the part of
Travers and bis migconduct ini connection wjth the
ar.,plication for the certificate, which I have mentioned,
tise evidence satisfied me tihat if the Bank had been
prudently and honestly managed there is no reason why
st should flot have suceeded. The promissory notes
that had been given by subscribors were for the most
part good and were subsequently paid, and while it is
true that if the certificate of tihe Treasury Board had
not been granted the money of tihe sharehoiders and
d,(positors would flot have been boat, the efficient cause
of that boss was the reekiesaneas and fraud of those
entrusted with the management of thse Bank, and flot
the granting of the certificats.

Se the Senate decided that there was no
moral dlaim, because the faiure was not
attributabie to any fault of omission or comnmission by the Departmnent of Finance in the
administration of the Bank Act.
On what ground is the present claimn based?
The depositors bave alleged that in 1916 and
1918 the Bank was not in a condition to continue business; that the Minister of Finance
was notified. and that hie had authority under
clause -56.A to instîtute a special and outside
audit o. 1ie Bank. It was urged by the
depositc-z that if an audit such as is provided
by section 56A of this Act had been instituted,

t72

SENATE

the Bank would either have been forced to
close its doors at the time or would have been
forced to amalgamate with some other bank
or organizati.on, and this would have completely saved the depositors. The Minister
of Finance, in net instituting under clause
56A an outside audit, was influenced to a
large degrce by the then existing war conditions.
On the reception of this petition from the
depositors of the Home Bank what was the
Government's action? It heard the representatives of the depositors, and some of the
depositors themselves were represented before the Royal Commission which sat and
heard evidence on the matters contained in

report 'was laid before Parliament, and was
referred to the B'anking and Commerce Committee of the House of Commons, which Committee appointed a sub-committee of seven to
review the evidence and report. That Committee, after we'ighing the evidence and Mr.
Justice McKeown's report, found that there
was a legitimate elaim in equity against the
public treasury. The report of that Committee was adopted by the House of Commons. What was that report?
Your Comnmittee have sat from time to time and
have studied the Interim Report on the Home Bank
subminitted by Mr. Chief Justrce MeKeown and the
evidenre therein referred to.
Yeur Committee consider that the facts therein
brougltt out and the evidence therein referred te clearly
establish that the depositors of the Home Bank have
n, claim under the law of the land for compensation
by the country on account of any loss they may suffer
by reason of the failure of the Home Bank.
But sotur Comnittee are also of the opinion that, in
vitw of the repre-entations made to the Department
of Finance in the years 1916 and 1918, the Goverament
of the t ie could have made in 1916 and in 1918 an
effective audit under Section 56A of the Bank Act, and
if suh ain effective audit or thorough investigation
into the Baink's affairs had been made it would have
re-sulted :
1. In the inmediate liquidation of the bank, or
2. Its amalgamation with another bank, and that the
effect would have been, no loss to the depositors in
1916 or 1918.
Lour Committee have studied the evidence given before the Royal Commission by Sir Thomas White, who
was then Minister of Finance, and particularly his
statemonts: "I would never think of putting in a
specal atuditor in a bank and taking chances, espedially
et a tine like that, of closing the bank" (page 345);
and fuirther: "Under no circumstances would I have
allewed a bank to fail during the period in question.
1 hadt many diffieult and dangerous financial situations
to deil w th during the war. Ait its outbreak, in view
of the panic which prevailed, the Government, at my
instauce, placed itself behind the bocks of Canada and
gave public assurance that it would loan them such
sms as they miglit require to meet the conditions of
the war, and would take all further steps necessary
to safeguard the financial situation during its contnuace'' (page 359); and further: "The action I took

auditor, in peace time the consequences may be a run
producing little effect upon the bank; if ýin war time,
you may bring down the bank and, in addition, you
ray cause an unspeakable calamity to the country"
(page 743).
Your Committee is not called upon to question the
aminer in which Sir Thomas White made use of the
powers given to him, or whether he exercised his discretion correctly or otherwise.
Your Comnittee consder that tihe facts brought out
in the Interim Report submitted by Mr. Chief Justice
MrKeown, and the evidence therein referred to, establish that the depositors of the Home * Bank have a
moral clam in equity for compensation by the country
on occountt of any loas they may suffer by reason of
the failure of the Home Bank.

This report, when submitted to the House
of Commons, was adopted without dissent.
Everyone knowxs that the Cabinet, the Government for the time being, is the executive
of the House of Commons. It received a
mandate from the House of Commons. Members of the Senate who have sat in the other
House may discuss from many angtles the
value of such an ýacition by the House of Commons. All I have to say is that when a branch
of Parliament speaks it can only do so by
overt acts; and when a report was !presented
on a matter which agitatead public opinion
and was of vital interest to tens of thousands
of people, it was of sufficient moment to be
taken seriously into consideration by the
members of that House, and I believe that
the report of the Committee was the serious
thought cf the House of Commons. No voice
was raised against it, no dissent was registered; hence the presentation to the two
branches of Parliament of the present demand
to pay to depositors, as compensation for their
losses the sum of $5,450,000.
I do not know if I should not stop here
and ask the Senate to vote the second reading
of this Bill under the present circumstances;
but, if my colleagues will bear with me for a
few minutes, I would l'ike to examine a little
more closely into the matter which is before
us.
I have hear'd the afigument that this Bil
creates a very d'angerous precedent; that there
rs no real serious reason given for rescuing
the depositors in the way we ask Parliament
te do, inasmuch as everyone is supposed to
know the law, and everyone, being supposed
te know the terms of the Bank Act, knew
that there was no Government guarantee
when he walked into the Home Bank to
make his depesit.
Well, if everyone is supposed to know the
law, I take for granted thiit it is necessary
for alil of us te say that the law cannot be
violated because it is unknown, since it
would be an easy way for a member of the

When one reads 'the Bsank Aot, it is dlear
that everyone deposits in any bank at his own

contained in this Bill, ane might say that

who were the three Western directors, Mr.
C-rerar being one of them, with two other
gentlemen from the West, wrote to the Minister of Finance through Mr. Crerar himself,
telling him that there had been a change in

Hon. Mr. ROCHE: Before the honourable
gentleman leaves that branch of his statement I would like to ask him; if there had
been an audit in 1918, from what source the
depositors then having money in the bank
would have obtained the money?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My answer to
my honourable friend is, first:
That the
deposits in 1916 were $10,028,224, in 19'18,
$14.988.422, and that when the bank closed
its doors in 1923, through the opening of
branches to receive deposits, they had jumped
to $19.295,735, so the situation in 1916 and
1918 was far less difficult to deal with than
it was in 1923.
I am not ready to express an
opinion as to where the money would have
come from; but Mr. Justice McKeown states,
after an examination of the witnesses and the
evidence produced before him, that the bank
would either have closed its doors and would
have succeeded at that time in repaying the
depositors by a liquidation, or it would have
been absorbed by some other institutions, inasmuch as sometimes the deficit is offset by
the goodwilil of the institution.
It is impossible to give in a few moments
the whole aspect of the situation.
I have
cited what is contained in the report of Mr.
Justice McKeown and reproduced in the report of the Committee of the House of Commons.
I have excerpts from a considerable
body of evidence given by Sir Thomas White;
but one needs to read the whole of the
evidence to find therein his self-justification.
He has stated that in order to judge the
action of a Minister one must put himself
in the place of the Minister at every moment
of the day and month and year when the
matters came before him.
With that statemen I agree. Sir Thomas White expresses
the conviction that with the amount of information he had he was justified in giving
the instructions which he did to try to
strengthen the bank and keep it going.
We often say, and we have all felt individually, that one is wiser after the event;
yet the depositors claim that throughout the
negotiations that were carried on between the
irectors of the Home Bank and Mr. Lash at
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

the time the new management was organized,
after the protest of the western directors, Sir
Thomas White did what he thought best under
the circumstances, but could not help being
influenced by the very serious situation which
he has described.
Now, in order that honourable gentlemenî
may have an inside view of the situation as
it appeared to a clear-headed legal gentleman
of Toronto, who had been appointed at that
time in order to try to steer the bank in
orthodox channels, I would cite a letter from
Mr. Z. A. Lash to Mr. James Fisher, the
gentleman who was corresponding for the
Western directors, and who was advising them
at Winnipeg.
The letter, addressed to the
Minister of Finance, denouncing the situation
of the bank in terrns that I have cited, is
On the
dated the 22nd of January, 1916.
29th of February, a month after, Mr. Lash
writes to Mr. James Fisher as follows:
The more I consider the bank's position, even
assuming that every account will ultimately be co;lected in ful, the more doubtftul t feel as to the
pnssibility of its continuing in business. The amount
locked up indefinitely in four large accounts, is probably
thee times the paid-up capital, and more than half
the total deposits; and if anythling should take place
which would cause a comparatively small percentage of
the depositors to ask for their money, I do not sec
how the bank would, without assistance from outside,
continue with open doors.
I told Sir Thomas that my main object, since I
learned in outline what the bank's position was, lias
been to bring about a position, which, if the worst
happened, would result in liquidation with open doors.
Tin ca
on!ly be brought about by the assistance of
cther banks, and I want definite instructions from the
board as to how far I may go in this direction in consultation with Sir Thomas White, for te is now an
essential element in the situation, which cannot be
disægardcd. He told me, and I could not dispute the
correctness of his position, that, a.fter you, on behalf
of the Winnipeg directors, had submitted to hin aformation whiclh, to say the least, was very disturbing,
the responsibility was thrown upon him, which te could
not avoid, and which would not be discharged because
those who had invited his intervention might desire
him to withhold further action.

This is the detter of Mr. Lash after he had
examined into the situation and knew fairly
clearly with what calamity the bank was
threatened.
Mr. Crerar's letter declaring
that he is satisfied that he has accomplished
his end by effecting a change in the management, which he had not been able to accomplish before lie appealed to the Minister
of Finance, is dated the 20th of March, 1916.
Well, honourable gentlemen, Mr. Justice
McKeown did not sit in judgment on the
exercise of discretion by the Minister of
Finance. I am not going to do so myseif,
and I am sure no one in this House desires
to sit in judgment on the exercise of bis
discretion.
But the depositors say, after
hearing all the circumstances of the case, that

trade unions, sud so forth,
and

deposited in the Home Bank and who

affectedi. I will cite just a couple of cases
in order to demonstrate iny meaning. In the
c:cy of Toronto there was one deposit of
about $12.000 that represented the funds of
the Toronto Street Railway Employees, and
belong-ed te about 3,400 men. In the city of

narrow and should have taken in all the
incidents in connection with the Home Bank
from the time its charter was granted until
its doors were closed. The correspondence
was a continued discussion of that question,
lasting from May until February. In the
communication of which I have been speaking
there was a reference to and repetition of
previous correspondence.
I will state just briefiy what has been my
view ever since the Home Bank failed-that
any inquiry held ought to bc thorough, entirely non-political, and absolutely on the
merits of the case, and judgment should be
rendored in accordance with the jfacts as
f ound.
I desire to carry the House back for a few
moments to the genesis of this bank. The
petition for an Act to incorporate the Home
Bank was presented to Parliament in 1903;
and I have discovered this peculiar fact in
connection with it, that the Bill was first
introduced in the Senate. On the 21st day
of April. 1903. a Bill, which is to be found
in Chapter 127 of the Statutes of 1903, was
introduced in this House and received its
first rcading. It was read the second time
on April 2:4, and the third time on May 29
of that year. It was thereupon sent to the
Commons, where it received its first, second
and third readings on June 3, 5, and 19
respectively.
In neither House, apparently,
was it debated or discussed at all. On July
10, 1903, an Act to incorporate the Home
Bank of Canada became law.
In Bill 45, which was submitted to Parliament in 1904, the provincial directors of the
Home Bank were named and there was a
request for an extension of time within whieh
the Bank or the directors might comply with
section 16 of the Bank Act, requiring certain
deposits to be made with the Finance Minister before the Treasury Board would issue
a certificate for the Bank to operate. That
Bill was introduced into the House of Commons on the 12th of April, 1904; on the 15th
of April it received its second readling, and
on the 18th its third reading. The Hansard
record of that Session indicates that the then
Minister of Finance rose in his place in the
House and objected to the second reading
of the Bill, observing that in his opinion it
was a violation of the Bank Act, and requested that the Bill stand over until he
could get time to look into it. Three days
later the Bill was reintroduced into the House,
and was given its second reading, and three
days later its third reading. The record does
not indicate, and we have no means of knowing, whether the then Finance Minister satislon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

fied himself that the Bill was in order, or
whether he did not have time to give it
consideration or investigation.
That Bill provided for an extension of one
year in which the directors of the Home Bank
might make the necessary deposit with the
Finance Minister. What did that delay indicate? It surely indicated that they were
not in a very strong financial conclitiion.
Another year went by, and while there is
nothing on the Parliamentary records to show
what happened after that, Mr. Reid, a solicitor
who acted for several of the depositors, made
before the McKeown Commission the statement, which so far as I know has never to
this day been contradicted, that no payment
was made to the Finance Minister, as required
by the Bank Act, until eight days afier the
Extension Act had expired; and that when
the certificate was granted eight days later
there was no legislation in existence at all to
enable the Home Bank to open its do-rs.
I have therefore contended, and said in the
letter which imy hon. friend the Prime Minister read the other day, that the bank was
conceived in inquity and born in dishonesty,
and that it never was in a solvent condition.
That may be a strong statement, coming from
a man who is not a banker, but I respectfully
refer my honourable friends in this House to
what occurred in Toronto the other day .before
Sir William M:ulock, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Ontario, when dealing with
these Home Bank appeals which are now before him. Counsel asked him the question:
"When, in your opinion, did the Home Bank
become insolvent?" and the reply of Chief
Justice 'Mulock was that the bank was insolvent the day it opened its doors. Surely
there we have some moral governmental responsibility. I am not attempting to lay the
blame on any individual, but simply pointing
out the cold concrete fact that there was
responsibility on the part of the Government
and of Parliament for permitting a bank to
open its doors for business, that was insolvent
when it opened.
Following that, what occurred? The same
gentlemen whose names are recorded in Bill
45, who applied for the extension of time, were
gentlemen who for the most part, if not in
every instance, were directors of an investment
and savings company which had done a large
business in real estate transactions in Toronto.
It is more than possible-indeed, it has been
stated to me by business men as a fact-that
those gentlemen conceived the idea of establishing the bank, and getting a charter, and
securing deposits, in order to helip them out,
because of their need of greater capital. Be

JUNE 15, 1925
that as it may, the fact remains -that shortly
after the Home Bank opened its doors for
business, it took over the assets and liabilities
of the investment company, though the
securities which the company hield were of such
a nature t1hat, under the terme; of the Bank
Act, the bêank was flot permitted to accept
them. It is true, and the correspondence with
]»y friend Mr. Lee reveals the fact-a frank
ad-mission on his part in one of his lettersthat at ieast one of those four ilarge accounts
which finally wredked the bank was among
the accounts taken over fromn that investinent
and saviýngs company. If there had been an
inspection, as te ihonourable leader of the
Govermnent says is in evidence now, and a
rea.sonable check had .been kept on transactions of that sort, proibably the difficulties
into which the Home Bank got itself 'would
neyer have oocurred; therefore perhaps the
bank itselî was flot to be held wholiy responsible for the lamentable crash whidh ultimately
came.
Fromn that time the bank fioated along
until 1916, at which date a Western director
made a report to the Minister of F'inance,
calling his attention to certain things which
that directc'r, Hon. Mr. Crerar, thought
were not quite right. A careful investigation
was gone into, and it developed, as I remember
the evidence before 'Comimissioner McKeown,
that the then Finance Minister had required
certain debtors of that bank to reduce their
indebtedness Jby more than $300,000, and also
to deposit with the bank substantial additionai
securities for the loans which they had.
In regard to the facts relating to certain
ouitstanding loansA called frozen asseta or
frozen loans, some of which were in Britih
Columbia, the Finance Minister was in doubt.
He subsequently obtained assurance îro'm the
very director who had coimplained to hi.m in
the first plara, that in his opinion the assets
behind those loans were amp4e, and that
they would' corne out ail right; and the
director strongly urged the Finance Minister
of that day not to have an open accounting,
or reveai the situation of the baink to the
public at large, lest it shouid resuit dlisastrously
to the bank.
The Finance Minister of that day was in a
delicate and diffloult position, but he has
stated. frankly a.nd honestly, as he always didhonest man as he has al'ways been-that,
no matter what the situation might have 'been,
hie wouid flot have permitted the Home Bank,
or any other bank, as I reinenber his words, to
have failed at that time, because of the war
conditions, and the effeet such a failure would
have had upon the whole country at that mo-

479

ment. Very shortly after the Home Bank
crashed, what happened? A run was madecn the
Dominion Bank, and the Ontario Government
deposited in that bank $1,500,000 to stabilize
the situation and stop the mun.
Now let us pass on a litle further. Sir
Thomnas White left the Govemniment, retiring
to private if e because of the condition of
iris health, and nassed to hie successor in
office certain information, which in turn was
handed over to the Minister of Finance of
the present Government when the change
occurred in 1921. During that interim there
hýad been no visible change in the situation;
but it is true that shortly after that sotne of
those large frozen loans hecame in a stili more
serious condition, and in 1923 the situation became acute.
Now I want for a few minutes to d'weli on
the chapter of the closing days of the Home
Bank. From 1916 to 1923, as my hanourable
friend the leader of the Government has
properly and truiy said, the deposits in the
Home Bank very substantially increased;
and it is held by those who have been representing the deposit ors that if the bank's
doors had been ciosed, in 1916 or 1918 the
losses would have been that much less. I
think I perceived this fact as my honourable
friend was speaking-that the difference between the amount of deposits in 1918 and 1923
virtuaiiy reprcsents the amount that the Government now proposes shouid be paid to the
depositors by way of relief.
When the bank reached the last days of
its existence, representations were made to
the Government, of Canada respecting the
bank's condition, and urgent requests were
made for financial assistance to avoid the
disaster. W-e do not know in detail what
occurred at that midnight session when the
directors came down here and intervîewed
certain Cabinet Ministers, including the Prinme
Minister; but we do know that on the day
following the 'Government obviously made
a decision that it could do nothing, because
we have a record of at ieast one member
of the Government who took action on his
own initiative. We have on record, in the
evidence of the Minister himself at the
McKeown. Commission, that the next day
he went with severai directors to Montreal,
and there had a conference with oertain gentlemen, Sir Vincent Meredith being mentioncd by name. We find in the evidence that
the present Acting Finance Minister, who
had then just been saddied with the duties
and responsibilities as Acting Minigter, without any prcvious knowledge or experience,
in that portfolio-therefore he has my

was a mistake; but 1 refrain fromn discussing

it because I realize my ignorance in respect

te banking mattors. The principle hehind
section 16 of the amended Act last year was,

in effeet, that. ne matter what mistakes the
administration may make, no matter whet'her
legisiation providing for close inspection of
banks is carried out or net, no matter what

may occur te a hank in this country, there is
no public obligation resting upon the state.
Is that net most extraordinary legislation?
Is it- not on alI fours with the little Bill we
were discussing here the other day, that was
te take away from thje judges of our country
the righit of exercising any discretion in the
administration of- criminel lew? Surely Parliament should net take the position thet it
cannot do justice te the people heceuse of a
fool lew pessed, at some other time. Therefore I held the view strongly, and I hold it
still, that the measure of relief now proposed

481

should not have corne before Parliament, as
a separate Bill, but, being a measure of relief and flot an obligation under the law,
sbould have followed the channel through
which. ail provisions for the public service
corne.
Just a word further in that connectionit is useless to go into it in detai], because
the Bill is before us: If we look back over
the history of Canada we will find that when
emergenciy relief or compassionate allowance
bas been granted, it bas always been included
in the Estimates, or when an emergency bas
existed, bas heen granted by Governor General's war¶rant and -bas subsequently been
placed in the Estimates and brougbt before
Parliament. That was the thought in my mmnd
*-and I think it was oomsnon sense-when I
intimated in the letter to Mr. Lee that perhaps it would b-e wise to suggest to the
Government that the relief should be submitted to Parliament in that form. The
Government bas flot seen fit to fol'low the
suggestion made to it by the Committee,
with which I concurred, and bas brought the
Bill before us as it is. I arn one who would
be glad to amend the Bill to the extent of
compensating in full the small depositor of
$1,000 .or $1,500, and dividiu4g the balance
among the larger depositors. 1 thjnk that the
scores, and indeed hundreds, of cases of dire
d'istress and poverty and suffering that have
corne to our knowledge during the hast year
and a haîf in connection witb the Home Bank
matter, would arnply justify Parliament in
differentiating along that line. But as the
legishation bau corne before us in its present
f orm in the last days of the Session, notwitbstanding that this tis the fifth month of
sitting and that tbe Royal Commission long
ago made its report, I hesitate to suggest a
change in the Bill. I therefore heartily
support tbe proposais tbe Government bas
laid before Parliarnen-t in this connection. I
feel that Parliarnent is tbe people's final court
of appeal and not a court of aaw to determine
legal rights, and that it should be regarded
as a temple of justice to defend the weak
tbat the nation maiy grow strong. Particularhy
and peculiarhy is it tbe function of the Senate,
as bas been frequently stated here by various
honouraible gentlemen, to safeguard the rights
of minorities. Let us Perforrn that duty.

CANADIAN EXHIBITION TRAIN IN
BRITAIN
INQUIRY AND DISCUSSION

Hon. C. P. BIBAUBIEN rose in accordance
with the following notice:
That he will cali1the attention of the Senate to the
exrediency of sending a Canadien Exhib~ition Train
through Great Britain and will inquire what action the
Government intends to take in the premises.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, I crave
your patience for a few moments while I submit to tbe Government, througb this Chamber
and I hope witb its tautbority, a suggestion
whicb in my humble opinion it would be wise
for tbem to adopt.
I bad the privilege last Session of cahling the
attention of this House to -the results accomplisbed by tbe Canadian Exbibition Train in
France and Belgium in 1923. I do not intend
to repeat wbat I said on that occasion, but I
would like to add something to it. It was
quite evident that the results accomplished
then were very gratifying; tbe wbohe of
France was deeply stirred at the effort made
by Canada; every record of attendance was
broken ini every city througbout France where
the train stopped; a great, deep and powerful
currenL of sympathy carried the venture
tbrough its whole course, and the entire press
of France, without one cent of expenditure
by Canada, gave us 2,80W columns of its spacer
mainly in the great city of Paris. I necd flot
tell you, honourabie gentlemen, that rnoney
could not bave purcbased for Canada advertising so effective and so beneficial. There was
an anxiety in this House, 1 arn sure, as there

wvas in my breast, lest that venture -hould be
anly a transient success, a noise the echo of
which would soon be lost, and from wbich
there wauld be no gond, substantial and lasting
resuits. W/cil, honourable gentlemen, I arn
very g'lad ta he able ta put before the Hause
a comforting assurance on that score.
In 1922, prior ta the passing through France
of the Exhi:bition Train, Canada's exports ta
France werc in round figures $12,000,000; in
1923 they grew ta $17,000,000, and in 1924
they bad grawn stilll furtber ta $25,000,000.
You m7ill recolleet that, just prior ta the passing of the train througb Belgium, Canada was
losing rapidly in ber exparts ta that country
as compared witb tha previaus year; but immediately aitar the train passed we began
ta register enormous increases. This is the
history, Written by statistics: in 1922, a ur exparts ta Baigiumn ware $12,000,000; in 1923,
$13,328,000; in 1924, $19,675,000.
Now, I owe it ta the Huse ta explain the
discrepancy between the figures shown in tbe
Canadian statistias and thýose cantained in
the statistias of France. I was very much
disturbed whan I read t.hat in another place
an bonouraible member had contended that
aur exparts ta France had fallen off between
1923 and 19ý24. 1 made it a paint ta inquire
]nta the situation; 1 wrote ta France for the
officiaI statistics, which 1 now bave. They
show in detail exactly the quantity af gonds
wbich wvere received in Fraînce under preferantial traatrncnt from Canada. Armed with
this information, I want over and saw the
head statistician of Canada.
I aAked him
what exýplanatian ha had ta, offar. In brief,
bis axplanation was-I have it in rny handthat aven in aur trade with the United States
wea cannot gat figuras ta balance; that there
is always a big discrapancy betwaan aur exparts ta the United States and their imports
frorn Canada; and that it was not surprising
that there shauld ba discrapancies wban twa

Canada. by 30ü00 miles af distance. and when

Mr. BEAUBIEN.

the shippar ot only the name af the port
ta whiab his gonds are shipped, but the name
af the country af ultimata destination for
those goads? If that were donc, wa would '-a
in a :position ta .iudge whethar a country that
aaeks ta obtain a treaty with Canada deserves
tha concassions that it dlaims; and, by cobsarving- tbe pragress accomiplishing in certain
caunitrias, we would be in a better position
ta direct aur own natianals with respect ta
faraigo trade.
Well, thera ave have a discrepancy, the
reasan heing, as I have stated, first, becaue
the statistical department bas not got the
informatian framn o:bar dapartmants which
it ghould bave, and, secondly, because wheat
ta tbe axtent af 4,000,000 bushels might bave
been shipped ta France by the United States
tbraugha Canadian ports. If that is the case,
the figuras whicb I bave quated ta you sbould
ba raducad by $4,000,000, and, although I do
nlot baliave it ta ha sa, yet I will reduce themn
by that amaunt.
Hawcver, as a ground for my argument,
please consider tbe increases which in one
country was from $12,000,000 ta $17,000,000
and ta $20,000,000, and in the otbrr country
fromn $12,000,000 ta $13,000,000 and ta $19,000.000.
Naw, honourabla gentlemen, I pass ta the
immediate purpase of the reso!ution before

those cities flocked in thousands to see our
Canadian goods. They were enthralled by
the films which they saw in the evening. All
through France there was intense curiosity to
see the Canadian train. and all the authorities
from one city to another welcomed the Canthem official
offering
delegates,
adian
luncheons and dinners, and the press was full
of incidents connected with their reception.
I was somewhat fearful as to the supreme
test when the train should reach the metropolis of France-Paris. Through the efforts
of my honourable friend, one of the best
locations, the central spot of France, was
secured, next to la Place de la Concorde, in
the Garden of the Tuilleries, and it was
amusing to see the thousands and tens of
thousands of Parisians flocking to the Canadian exhibition. The admission was free.
From the President of the Republic to the
humblest labourer, hundreds of thousands of
thither in
people wended their way
order to obtain the privilege of entering and
looking at Canada as visualized in the dioramas, which were splendidly made. Those
people returned full of enthusiasm and
admiration for our grand ceuntry.
Now, if the heart of France, Paris, was
thus enthralled, I am not surprised to find
that throughout the whole of France all of
the people who could reach the centres where
our train went flocked to see it; and verily
I believe that if we applied to Great Britain
the system which was so successful in France
it would yield formidable results. I may say
to my honourable friend that I am heart and
soul with his idea, and will try to bring my
colleagues in the Cabinet, particularly the
Ministers of Immigration and Trade and Commerce, to share my optimism.

CORRECTION

On the Orders of the Day:
Honourable
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON:
gentlemen, may I respectfully call the attention of the House to a somewhat important
omission in the record of last evening's sitting?
In the typesetting or some other process of
preparing the record, the word "not" was
left out, on page 526, and the omission entirely reverses the meaning that I intended
to convey. I deem the matter important
enough to call to the attention of the House.
The sentence referred ta reads as follows:
The Finance Minister of that day was in a delicate
and difficult position, but he has stated frankly and
bonest-ly, as he always did-honest man as he bas
always been-that, no matter what the situation might

have been, he would have permitted the Home Bank,
or any other bank, as I remember his words, to have
failed at that time.

What I said was:
Would not have permitted the Home Bank, or any
other bank, as I remember his words, to have failed at
that time.

Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable gentlemen, in rising to give to this House, very
briefly, a few reasons why in my opinion this
Bill should not be passed by this House, I
have little hope or expectation that I may
be able to influence any members in this
Chamber. If in March last I had been asked
by any person on the street, or in this House,
what fate such a Bill as this would be likely
to meet, I would unhesitatingly have said:
"I do not think that more than ten or fifteen
members of the Senate would give it individual support. I doubt that there would
be that many." It is to me surprising that
during the last few weeks a great change bas
occurred in the attitude of many honourable
members in this and in another Chamber.
Appeals have been coming in to members, in
sheaves of telegrams-I have received some
myself-and scores of letters. Most skilful
propaganda has been conducted by people
who are interested-and with them I have no
fault to find, because I have the utmost sympathy for the people who lost money by the
failure of the Home Bank, as I have the utmost sympathy for all of the bundreds of
thousands, even the millions, of people in
Canada who lost money from the same cause,
namely, that a state of war existed. But this
propaganda has evidently had a great deal
of success if I may judge by what appears to
me to be a considerable change in sentiment.
It is not on the part of the public. I believe
that out of the nine millions of people we
have in this Dominion there are 60,000 who
are prejudiced; 60,000 people were depositors
in the Home Bank, and those people want to
get thir mnoney back. They would not be
huma- " hey did not. But all the rest of
the nine millions are opposed to this proposition. If this is a matter of political ex-

SENATE
pediency, and if either party or both parties
play Up te that idea, then either or both are
going against what is in my judgment the
wish of the people of this Dominion, and are
veting for a principle which, to judge by the
history of Canadian legisiation, they wiil
regret as long as they live, and which. those
wbo corne after us will regret stili more.
Wba-t is. briefly, the proposai in this Bill?
It is to grant $5.000.000 te compensate peoplo
wbo had deposits in the Home Bank. Ir,
the first place, where is the rnoncy to corne
from? Have we the moncy? Not one cent.
Weowe money.
We are goinz bebind
$50,000.000 or $60,000,000 a year. Wbere are
we going to get thie money? WC have to go
out into the market place and borrow it, in
order to pay it over to, these 60.000 depositors.
The resuit wvill he that we wbn are doing
this now will flot pa.y it. Who is going to
pay the additional $5.000.000 added to the
public debt of this country? It will be payable for ail tirne 'by our ebjîdren who arc
coming after us. It is simply anýother piling
up of this awful public debt which is staggeri1cr the country and stifiing ail its industry.
What is a bank? A bank is not a national
institution. No bank is nationalized. A bank.
after a1l. is simiply a corporation auithorized
under tbe laws of Canada te do business in
Canada for the purpose of making a profit.
That. and tbat al-one. It is true, that these
banks now operating in Canada are granted
wbat may be called certain exclusive and
particular privileges, for whicb they corne
under certain obligations; but, by and large,
gencrally speaking, t'bc banks of Canada are
sîmplv commercial intitutions trading in
moncv for :heir own b'ncefit and for notbing
else.
It bas been claimed-not very logieally, not
very seriously, not very ernpbatically. so far
as concerns any of the speeches that bave
been made in this House, or so far as 1 bave
been ab!e to read speeches made in another
place-tb'it there were certain conditions connected witb the Home Bank wbich imp.osed a
duty upon the public. It bas been said. in
tbe first place, that the bnnk was not properly
orgainized and the inspe-tion of it was not
properly carried out. 1 do not intend for
one minute to enter into the arguments in
the case. I may say that I bave perused

I will grant you that tbis Home Bank was
an evolution oqf what had been a savings

Toronto, and it may be, and pro.bably is,
quite correct to say that there were irregularities in the building up of this bank; but
1 want to say still fuctber that there is not
a bank doing- business in Canada to-day, nor
bas there been agny or.ganized since Confederation, tbat bas not, knowinigly or unknowingly,

Who else is there? What happened to the
farming population of this country in 1917

and 1918? Why are our farmers leaving the
Province of Quebec and the Maritime Provinces and, as far as I know, other Provinces?
1 know very well, because I arn a farmer too,
and 1 came home frorn overseas in 1917. A
steady strearn of propaganda was going out
from Ottawa te " produce, produce, produce;
raise grain, raise beef, make butter, raisa
sheep, preduce feods to keep the country
alive and to, help our allies in Europe fight

ernment to produce. What was the result?
The result was that every farmer in the
country turned over more sod te put into
cultivatien fields wbich neyer, under normal
conditions, should have been put into cul*ivation; te raise calves and fatten beef, which
neyer should have been done. The farmer
went into the pig-raising business when hae

in this country, andi because the Governiment

as did the Goverument of Great Britain the
farmer there, and the urge swept him along
with the resuit that when the war ceased
wheat went down $1 a bushel, hay went down
$9 a ton, heef on the heef went dowc from
12 cents a peund in the Maritime Provinces
te 4,L cents a pound. Every article that the
farmer produced dropped te such an extent
that be could net possibly sali it for more
than 50 per cent of what it had cost him te
produce it. Every farmer who was producing
te any extent employed help, and, instead of
paying about $1 a day and board, as ha
had dene befere, he paid $3, $4, and $5 a
day. If he wanted a mewing machine which
in 1912 cest $M, in 1916 or 1917 he had te
pay $85 for it; if ha wanted to buy a harrow,
wvhich ordinarily cost $14 hefere the war, ha
paid $28 or $29 or $30 or $4 for it, according te the particular type that hae bought.
The result was that the farmers of the country
found themselves with ail this produce in
process of production; yeu cannot miake a
cow or a steer or a pig fit fer market in a
day, and yeu can only produce a crep as
God's sunlight shines on it and as the ramn
fails; and the result was that our farmers
were paralyzed. I know of farmer after farmer wvho in 1914 and 1915 was prespereus and
making meney. who hati $2,000 or $3,000 or
$4,000 or upwards on deposit in our banks-

I could give the name, day and date-and
who, in 1921, had flot a cent left. And many
of them have had to put a plaster on their
farms in the shape of mortgages in order to
live and keep and educate their children.
Figures were raad here racently by the honourable gentleman from Montarville (Hon.
Mn. Beaubien) regandiing people who had lef t
this country. I venture to say that those
people who are leaving and who have left,
according to the statement that he hrought
forward, would neyer have left if the same
conditions existed in Canada which existed
previous to the war. Why should not the
fanmens neceive remuneration if you are going to rernunerate the people who lost money
in the Home Bank? I ar n ot making any
charge against the people who deposited their
money in the Home Bank, but I arn trying
to sea how we are to justify taking money
fnom one person and giving it to another.
The people on whom. this country has to depend for its development and growth are the
pioneers. The history of civilization and progress proves absoluteiy that, first, you have
the farmer, then you get the business man,
then the manufacturer. Always the others
follow the farmar. The producer, the cultivator of the soul, is the foundation of eveny
country. The finat men who came to, America
were tillars of tha soul. We did not have a
factory on the whole Atlantic coast until we
had many farmers clearing out the wildenness
and building up their farms. The farmer,
the trader, and then the factory: that is
what we have to have in Canada. But we
are driving out the fanmer, business ia drying
up, and as it dries up manufacturing establishmeants are baing closed. So much for the
farmer.
Hene is another statement which may interest you. More than 7,000 business houses
and firrns in Canada went out of business
because of the war and war conditions. I
do not say that the Government is responsible,
and Parliament is not responsible for the
Home Bank. It is not responsible, aither,
for the loss of the farmers. It used its best
judgrnent and did its hast under extrema conditions. The war upset the whole progress of
cîvilization, and introduced new conditions
which had to ha met as best they could. But
one restriction is imposed upon us, namely,
that we are not to ramunerate one group
unless we rernunerate ail. If we are to, establish the principle of remunerating a. few, then,
to be decent and generous and honest and
stnaightforward about it, we have to go further. We cannot put back into operation the
thousands of factories that have closed since
1918; we cannot put under cultivation the

farms that have been abandoned; but we
certainly would be bound to examine the
cases thoroughly and to hear the evidence,
and to determine if this factory or that farm
failed because of the war and if we so determined, if we passed this Bill we wouid be

for a few moments while I explain to the
members of this House and the people of this
country why I am going f0 vote in :bhe way
that I amn upon this bill. The Bill provides
foir the payment of $5,450,000 from the pockets of tl:e people of this country for n debt
whicb, according f0 the sta orent of the leader
of the Governrnont, this country does not owe.
If that stafemont is truc, as I believe if ia,

he would net have done anything ether thal,
what Sir Thomas White did. Did Sir Thcaas
White act as he did solely and ouly beca&use
the country was at war? Did hae do it because the banks of this country were i
danger? Did he do it because if he had net
done it Canada would have been ruined in its
financial situation?
NO; he tock the precautiens that a brave man., a big mati, a mati
who understood the finances of Canada, would
have taken. He totsk the advice of the best
lawyer. He took the advioe of the mati in
the western country who knew hest about
this batik. and, believing in Mr. Thomas
Crerar and in Mr. Z. A. Lash, as I do, I say
that Sir Thomas did ail that was necessary
when hie listened te and believed what they
told him-when they said that the interests (if
the hank at that time were safe, and that they
hoped and believed that it would stili pull
through.
Use bas been made of the faet that Sir
Thomas White said that he did neot want any
.bank to fait. Is there any mati in Canada
who does nlot know that hie did not want
th.em ta fail? Those of us who bave sat on
the 'boards of batiks, as 1 have done, know
something of the terrible strain we went
through during the war; but no disaster
happened, and one reason was that at that
time we had a brave Minister of Finance,
who proeoted not only one bank, but every
baik in this Domainion. If the batiks in
Canada were able to weather the stormi during the days and' years of war it was due
te that splendid Minister, at whom if is a
shame for nowspapers and political opponents,
and sometimes polîtical friends, to cast one
slur by reason of anytbing bie did or did nlot
do for the Home Bank. T'here is nlot one
line on the record of the Commission or anywhere else that makes me think that the Minister of Finance did anything to ineur any
lia.bility on the part of the people of this
country towaids the depositors of the Home
Batik, and I therefere dechine to accept any
responsibility.
Ilonourable gentlemen, I do nlot believe that
if is necessary for tihe people of Canada t0
put uýp $5,450,000 to save any condition that
bas arisen ont of the failure of tha-t batik.
I know of men wbo had 44,000 or $5,000
deposited in the Home Bank, who under this
Bui will be treated just exa'ctly as saime poor
washerwomnan who may have had a few dollars
i the bank and t0 wbom we are asked ta
give cbarity. 1 know of men in this country
who had thousands (if dollars in tbe Homne
Bank, who propose ta start ouf witb the help
of Parliament ta loot the treasury of this

491

country. when there is ne resn wby tbey
should have a cent.
If the Governanent bad a prciper vision of
wbat sbouid bave beeti doue they would nlot
have formulated this Bull and put it as tbey
did Upsiý.e down. Tt may be that t.here are
people wbo badl deposits in that batik, and
thus suffered loss, who might well be assisted
to a certain degree as pure cbarity, but that
does not apply to any except a rnigbty small
minority both in number and ameunt. The
statement wus made by tbe honourable
Senator from Welland (Hon. Mr. Robertson)
that tbousatids of memibers of hais organizatiens had. many thausands -of dollars deposited;
but if bie would tal<e a pencil and divide up
this fond coming to them, bie would sce how
many cents apiece those men would get.
Wben tbe honourable gentleman taiks about
thec wailing and groaning by the people that
compose that organization, 1 do net agree
witb bim tha-t there is going ta be such
suffering by the people bie represents or of this
country as lie would lead us te believe.
Honoucrable gentlemen, 1 do nlot believe the
people of Canada will agree with the Senate
if they concur in tbis disposition of the large
sum that is pro-posed. I do nlot believe that
it is fair, rigbt *or proper for the Senate ta

this Bill. Id ne other mýemiber is goiog te

By that time I- hope the 'Govertiment and
the peoiple wbo are responsible for this Tesolution will have been able to consider some
course that will not ereate a precedent thaf
may bave the serious effect on the future
legisiation of Canada tbat this Bill may have
if it Passes.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I tbink
I sbeuld net allow this discussion te close
without giving expression to somne views wbich
1 hold u-pon tlic suibject now before us. I
have ne apologies to offer in speaking i 0 support -of this Bill, inasrnuch as on a former
occasion, in Aine, 1914, the important responmibility rested upon my shoulders of pregenting fa this Ilouse a similar Bill in connection
with the Farmers' Banik. The Govertiment of
that day, apparently, must bave viewcd the
situation in the rame manner as thbe Govertiment of to-day has viewed the Romp
Batik. Tne Bfil did not meet with acceptanas in this Houas, but was defeated by a
verv small majority. It therefore cannot be
said thiat there is tic precedet for the Bill
new before us. In fact, we are flot confined
te the Frmnera' Bank Bill of 1.914; but the
Govcrnment of Canada at the time of Cou-

SENATE

492

federation assumed the responsibility of dealing with the affairs of the Bank of Upper
Canada, and of winding up that institution
and meeting its obligations.
The same remarks apply to the Exchange
Bank in the eighties. At that time the Government of the day assumed the responsibility
of paying the depositors. The Government
of 1914 therefore felt confident in presenting
the Farmers Bank Bill to Parliament, and
likewise I assume the Government of to-day
feel confident in presenting this Bill for the
support of Parliament.
When I speak of Parliament I use a term
which some honourable gentlemen seerm to
think represents an institution with arbitrary
principles of rigidity and Inelasticity which
cannot be deviated from. But I know of
no institution in society so elastic as that of
Parliament.
After all, Parliament simçply
means a gathering of the people of Canada,
represented by those whom they select, and
who may express the wish of the public at
large; and no one can say nay to Parliament.
They are a daw to themselves. They -undo
to-day what they did yesterday. They can
make a crime to-day out of what was not
immoral yesterday. They can give freedom
to-day where there was tyranny yesterday.
And why should it be said that Parliament
should not do this, and should not do that,
and should not do the other, inasmuch as
it represents practically a gathering of the
people who take certain action in regard to
a given state of facts?
Take, for instance, the case before us. Parliament bas apparently concluded that the
facts presented by the 'Government of the
day touching the failure of the Home Bank,
which was a national disaster, constitutes such
a state of things as to warrant intervention.
Is there anything unreasonable in that? Is
there anything more unreasonable in Parliament conisidering, from a compassionate standpoint, the distress, destitution and poverty
which have been created by the loss of those
60,000 depositors, and of making a vote of
a silmilar amount for some unrequired public
work for the purpose of satisfying the clectors
cf a particular district? Is there anything
more unreasonable in the one than in the
other? Why, honourable gentlemen, I could
point out now, with some advantage, the fact
that this vote is very much more meritorious
than many votes than have been passed by
Parliament during the present Session.
It may be said that this is but an expedient. After all, I know of no action of
Parliament that is not an expedient. I venture to say that no measure is submitted
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

to Parliament, no vote is dealt with by Parliament, that does net originate in expediency;
and why should it be said that this, being
a measure of expediency, must therefohre be
condemned? Is it inexpedient that Parliament
should consider the cry cf 60,000 peopfle that
the loss which they sustained in the failure of
this bank should be reim'bursed, them, and
that they should be relieved from the poverty
and distress incident thereto? It seems to me
that a subject of this kind is one that should
merit the best attention of the Parliament of
any nation.
Then, I would point out to my honourable
friends, more particularly those who come
from a point east of the western limit of
Quebec, that the majority of the people of
Canada who suffered in this national disaster
live west of Quebee, and that they are almost
a unit in asking the Government for relief.
It is not unreasonable that I should say te
those gentlemen who live east of Quebec,
and who may not have corme in close contact with the victims of this great loss,
that they should view it froin the same standpoint as those of us who live in the community cf those who have been sufferers
through this unfortunate event.
This may be said to be a compassionate
al}owance, and it is a compassionate measure.
It is deservedly of a compassionate nature,
and I fail to understand why the mind of the
Government to-day should not be understood
by those who adversely criticize the Bill by
reason of the fact of pressure which has been
brought te bear upon them through organizations of the depositors which, I may say, have
had more ramifications and more influence
than any organization I have known of in connection witb a matter of this kind. These have
been brought te bear on the Government in
impressing on their minds that this is a subject which demands attention. There is not
an honourable gentleman in this House but is
familiar with the fact that day after day,
week after week, month after month, those
organizations have conducted a propaganda
in the public press, on the platform and elsewhere, whch necessarily must have reflected
itself upon the Government of the day, and
the Government cannot close its ears to the
demands or requirements of the people. The
Government of the day is there for that purpose, to listen to the representations that may
be made by the public, and to give attention
accordingly.
I cannot say that there was a legal obligation
upon the Government. In a sense there is
no legal obligation upon a Government. A
Government is the most dominant power in

JUNE 16, 1925
the state. It ean absolve itself at any time
from responsibility, but it occasionally accepts
responsibility. It is not urged in this case
that there was legal responsibility on the part
of the Gavernment to make good those deposits; yet how oiten in everyday life do we
flot insist on legal responsibility in dealîng
with aur fel-low man? We accord to hica the
right ta our best consideration as to whether
we shall entertain the dlaim which he may
have against us, notwithstanding the iact that
he could flot eniorce it in law. There are
comparatively very few matters that corne
before a Government in which there can be
saiti ta be a legal responsibility on its part.
The Governrnent may exercise its discretion in
matters in which there rnay be no legal responsibility, or in matters in which there may
be a moral or equitable responsihility,
and it is the duty of the Government
af the day, as it is af the Government
ai any country, to give every consideration ta
moral dlaims as well as ta those that constitute
legal dlaims.
I ar n ot prepareti ta absolve this Gavernment, nar the preceding Government, nor the
Governiment preceding that, from the responsibility which it had ta the public in connection with the banking institutions af this
country. Sa long as I have been in Parliarnent I have heard demands matie for a
proper system ai inspection; and ye't, until
the situation was so accentuateti by the disaster
which taok plaoe in 1923 in connection with
the Home Bank, no consideration was given
ta the appointment of a pro.per inspectorate.
Since that disaster we have been given a
system af inspection whereby a repetition of
what bas taken place would be, I venture ta
may, impossible. 'If preývious tovernmrents
coulti have saveti that situation by placing
upon the Statute Book proper safeguards for
the depositors who have millions and millions
ai dollars in our banks, is the Gavernment
of this country absolved entirely from respansibility in view af its failure ta establish
proper safeguards for the protection ai depasitors?
I say, furthermore, that f rom 1903, wvhen
this banik was established, until 1923, it was a
festering sore. What really surpriseti me was
that the different banks af -the country, as
well as persans who were more or aess farniliar
with the unfartunate state of affaira which
prevailed in that bank, titi not insist upon
the Govermment of the day, ne matter what
Government it was, intervening and thus saving the situation. Up to the ackvent af the
Bortien Governmnent in 1911 it ws well known
that thia bank hat taken over the assets ai

9

the Home Savings and Loan Company, assets
which coulti not be taken aver under the
Bank Act. This was a direct violation af the
Bank Act which threateneti the Bank's solvency and finally resulteti in its wreckage.
The Gavernment of that day did flot intervene. By a proper systesn of inspection the
Gavernment ai that day would have become
aware. of the bank having assumeti responsibility for transactions in violation ai the
Bank Act.
The suceeeding G-overnirnent hati some attention directed ta the uni ortuna-te condition
oi affaîrs, by three -oi the bank's Western
directors, Messrs. Crerar, Persse anti Kennedy,
visiting the Minister cf Finance and paintifig
out its unsatisfactory situation. Yet Sir
Thomas White, w1ho was then Minister of
Finance, was not allowed ta intervene in its
aiffairs. They said: "Notwitbstanding aur
directing yaur attention ta the conditions ai
ta-day, we think we ean rectiiy these affaira
ourselves;" and we find Mr. Crerar going
out ta the Pacific Coast and Mr. Haney down
ta New Orleans, inspecting the doubtful
securities which threateneti the solvency ai
the bank, anti coming back anti expressing
their satisfaction, and reorganizing the internal affairs ai tihe 'bank, and aasuring Sir
Thomas White that everythinrg wo>ulti be
lovely from that time an.
Another Governrent came into po-wer in
1921. Can it be saîd that that (lovernment
is entirely a'bsolved fram aIl res9ponsibility?
Why, the condition ai aiffairs at that. time
was worse than ever, and was a matter ai
piiblic notoriety and oi discussion on the
streets. Yet there was no intervention. Under
those circumstances c-an it be sait that the
Gavernarnent ai the country is free af alI
responsibility? I absolve it cf legal respansibihity, but is it not morally responsible in
view ai the situation which I have briefly
outlined? I veniture ta say that M there
bias been a moral responsibility an the part
of a Government ta reimburse shareholtier
ai a tiefunct bank, it is in this case which
we are considering ta-day.
It is i.mnecessary for me ta occupy any
iurther time except ta say, honourable genflemen,' in view af the fact that 1 intraduceti
a somewhat. aimilar Bill in 1914, anti being
more or leas in contact with the results ai
this failure, and baving a tieep sympathy for
the tiepositors, I arn very glad ta supp~ort the
Bill.

in regard to the action that we are bound ta

ta Canada and the welfare of this country,
this fact should have a greater bearing upon

people.
I do not think the present honourable members of this House are lees disposed
ta be generous than those who 'have preceded
tbem, but we must face and realize the
serious position in w.hich the country finds itself at the moment. If we open the door ta
any one who comegs along with a good story
and asks for compensation, it is bard ta sec
who will close it.
I -have been told from different sides of
polities that there is a political issue in this
mattLer-that thete is a, dependence upon votes
for one party or the other. Sa far as I arn
concerned, I do not sympathize with that
a .rgument.
I do not approve of men in
this placé, or another place, dividing an party
lines on an issue of this character, regarding
the respoilsibility of baaiks and the responsibility of the Government, w-ho issue charters
ta banks atid give them the privilege of d'oing
the finantial business of the nation, and give
the man in the street ta, understand that bis

ail, been tauglit that fromn childhood up. "As
safe as the bank" is a familiar expression.
I sincerely sympathize with the poor people
who innocently or ignarantly deposited their

chartered by the Government, and whose
charter was an invitation for people ta deposit

"depositor" becornes very artificial and broad
in its meaning. Section 3 says:

CONDITIONS 0F DIVORCE BILL
SECOND BEADING

The Semnate resuined from June Il the
adjourned dehate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Wiiloughby for the second reading; of Bill 4,
an Act respecting Divorce.
8-32

497

Hon. JULES8 TES;SIEÈR: Honoursble gentlemen, when I moyéd the adjournment of
the debate the othex' day I had no intention
of making a long disdourse on this subject,
and since then, havlng rend the very eloquent
addresses made by the hoaourable memnber
for Grftville (Hon. Mr. Chaplin) and the
honurable inember for Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Beleourt), aIl I want tu say is that I cofleur
entirely in the opinions that they have expressed, for I find that I arn unable ta bring
fny new arguments to support the position
they have taken.
As far as the Bill, which bas for its effeet
opening wider the door and giving of greater
faciity for divorce, I mnust say that it canlneot be aecepted by those who believe that
the sanctîty ci marriage is the bulwark of
society. The natural order of the family
depends on its stability. How can those who
in -front of the altar have prornised to 'be
united for life, for better or for worse, have
the ssci courage te asIc for the breairing of
that tie for ail kinds of futile reasons?
Marriage is a -moral contract, having in view
something more than the happiness andi the
pleasure of the partiese-having in view the
fulfilment of imnportant duties, the principal
one being the procreation of chilciren who will
carry on a strong and pure race. To becorne
good citizens, the chilciren require loving care,
having hefore their eyes examples and traditions which they wiîî transmit to their
descendants. How can thie object be attained
when the chilýdren are witnesses of family divisiens ending in a separation which becomes
legalized by courts cf divorce? These chilciren
are often seen wandering from one parent te
the other, and they are the victime cf divorce.
Judging ftorn the reports ftrm certain States
te the south of us, the marriage bond ia
broken for the slightest reason, and the alarinin-gly increasing number of divorces granteci
the world over is a menace cf social dissolution and shows that it is a wrong principle.
The praposeci Bill intends te make it easier
to obtain a divorce, andi 1 cannot support it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, inasrnuch. as I have for soe
years beenl more or less associated with the
Committee on Divorce, 1 have taken sorne
interest in what I might term, the doctrine
cf divorce. Ç5ondemn divorce as we may, yet
it is an institution not only of this century,
but cf the last century, and is s0 strongly
entrencheci in our civilization that it is imapossible tO abolish it. There are certain institutions that rnake up our civilization, and
we might as well accept philoao'phicnllY the
fact ,that they are here te stay; that they

SENATE
are the product of public opinion and public
requirements; and, condemn them as we may,
that it is impossible to destroy them.
Of all the powerful institutions that we
have in society the institution of divorce may
be said to be one of the strongest. It not
only commands the attention of the best
minds on this continent, but aiso the best
minds of Europe. It receives the attention
of every Government in the way of advancing laws touching it and préventing abuses,
so far as it is possible, of an institution of
that kind.
The question arises if the Bill before us is
out of harmony in any sense with the doctrine
of divorce. I submit that it would be reactionary on our part to reject this Bill. It has
been passed in England; it has had the support of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who is
not likely to give his support to legislation of
this character if it were not possessed of
merit.
We have the same doctrine in the
We have the same
Parliament of Canada.
law in the Maritime Provinces; but the four
western provinces are labouring under an antiquated statute of 1857, which was repealed
in England, and it is simply asked that Canada he placed upon an equality with not
only Great Britain but with other countries
that have passed similar legislation-not only
that, but that those four provinces be placed
on an equality with the Maritime Provinces,
and with the Federal Parliament, that adminirec l1w the -ame qs i.s embodied in this
propomdf,( Bill.
Now, equality of law is a desirable element to
be introduced into all provinces.
If we have
invidious distinctions between provinces, they
lead on'v to confusion and dissatisfaction.
There is no good reason, on the ground of
equalit' alone, entirely apart from the merits
of the Bill, why this Bill should not be passed.
As to the merits of the Bill, it surely is
meritorious that a wife should not be subject
to the cruelty of ber husband before she bas
a right to make application to a court for
relief.
Let me read what constitutes cruelty
under the law as it is at present.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is, as the
court understands it, not as Parliament understands it, which is a very different thing.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, as
the court understands it.
A decision of the
Appellate Court of Ontario, 1920, defines
cruelty as follows:
To establish cruelty, one must show treatment likely
to produce, or which produces physical illness, or
mental distress, or of a nature calculated permanently
te affect her bodily health, or endanger her reason, and
that there is reasonable apprehension that the same
state of things will continue.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

In the judgment above referred to, Chief
Justice Meredith reluctantly agreed with the
decision, but used these significant words:
The law is not in accord with modern views

as te

the relations between husband and wife. That it is
such, is te be deplored. Her life may be made a
veritable hell upon earth, and she is without remedy,
if robust enough te suffer it all, without impairment
of her physical health or her mentality.

In 1921, Chief Justice Harvey, of Aliberta,
in the case of Torsell vs. Torsell, found at
page 200 in 16 Alberta Law Reports, used this
lanuace:
It has been accepted in England, that legal cruelty,
to support a wife's claim, must be such as te cause
dlaiger te her life, or health, present or future. There
imny be mnuch rooin for dissatisfaction, but that is a
mttnter which can be easily and effectively cured by
the Legislature, if it desires.

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: How about desertion?
Could that b construed as cruelty?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am
speaking of cruelty now.
Some judges might
'o interpret it, and some might not. But a
wife makes application for a divorce at present
in the four provinces to-day which I have
nentioned.
Her husband may be a roue; he
toay be a debauchee of the worst character;
he mi he living in open adultery; and yet she
has no relief.
Immediately she presents ber
case the court says: "Is there cruelty? Has
voir husband beaten you up?"
She replies:
"Well, my husband has not beaten mn up,
thius far."
And the court replies:
"'Well,
vour husband w ll bave to beat you up before
you can get redress in this court."
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is not according to the definition my honourable friend has
ceaid.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: So the
wife lives in hope that possibly on some
future day she may take the chance of being
beaten up, so that she may get the remedy
that the law denies lier to-day except that unfortunate condition of affairs happened.
J am sure that honourable gentlemen in
this Chamber do not wish to continue a condition of affairs such as that. The principle
of law administered by this Parliament in
granting divorce, and also in the Maritime
Provinces and Great Britain, should be good
enough for those four Western provinces. The
fact that they are on the prairie is no reason
why women there should not have the same
freedom as they are given in the rest of the
Empire.
For these reasons I will be very glad to support the Bill that is before us.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable gentlemen, it seems to me there
is only one question before this Senate at
this time. If the question were as to whether

JUNE 16, 1925

divorce should be made legal, and a system
should be set up and operated with that view,
I might agree on a good many points with
,honourable gentlemen who have advanced
views against the principle of divorce. This
Bill, however, is simply to remove discrimination against a certain section of the people;
and the odd thing about it is that the Senate
itself, year by year, carries out a system of
individual divorce which grants the very
grounds asked for in this Bill. The absurdity
of the discrimination is emphasized by the fact
that women may come from those four provinces in the West and prefer their claim for
a divorce before the Senate, which has in
operation a system by which that claim is
recognized and the divorce can be granted.
Therefore the question is not on the principle of divorce, but as to removing a discrimination which is unjust in itself, as between different parts of Canada. The claim
for the removal of that discrimination is made
stronger by the fact that the Senate carries
on an operation of pronouncing and legalizing divorce for the very causes which are
operative in the other parts of the Dominion,
and which are asked to be operative in those
Western provinces. It is therefore on the
simple question of discrimination that I think
we ought to give our vote to-day.
The motion for the second reading of the
Bill was agreed to on the following division:

CHANGING THE CANADIAN

CONSTITUTION
PROPOSED

RESOLUTION

The Senate resumed from May 14 the debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. Turgeon:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, it is inexpedient that any change take place in the Constituton of Canada as established by the British North
America Act and amendments thereto, as set forth in
the Speech from the Throne at the opening of the
present session of Parliament, without the unanimou
consent of the Provinces affected by such change to be
expressed by the Legislatures of the respective Provinces.

Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlemen, after the numerous and brilliant addresses which have been made in this House
and elsewhere on this question, there remains
very little for me to add to what has already
been so well expressed.
On a previous occasion fault was found with
the Government for calling a conference between the Government of the Dominion of
Canada and the governments of the various
provinces to consider the advisability of
amending the British North America Act,
with respect to the constitution and the
powers of the Senate. For my part, I am
not disposed to quarrel with the Government
for calling such a conference. If we bear
in mind that one of the chief functions of this
House is to check hasty legislation passed
by the House of Comons and sometimes
to reject bills which in the best interest of
the country should not be finally passed, we
should not be surprised if this House is
sometimes attacked by members of the community having personal interest in such Bills
or by disappointed politicians. When the
attacks are repeated and come from many
quarters the Government may deem it its
duty, were it only to set the question at rest,
to submit it to aill parties interested, as is
proposed to be done. I am inclined to think
that the discuæion which will take place in
the press and at the conference will result
in a better appreciation of the powers and
action of the Senate and the manner in which
it deals with the bille that are engaging its
attention from time to time. Moreover, the
proceedings of the Senate are generally ignored by the press, and ;f it were not for
the attacks to which it is subjected periodieally, the publie would lose sight of the good
work which is donc very quietly by this
House.

00

SENATE

A motion was lately made in, another place
and a;bly supported by the honourpble momber for West Calgary. Hlis motion was:
That in the opinion of the House ai Commans, the
Senate as at present conatituted is nat af the greatest
advantage ta Canada.

The avowed object of the honourable member was ta o{pen the door for the expression
of opinions as to the nature of the amendments which should Ibe made to the constitution in regard ta the Senate, if any amendment is ta be made. As was to be expected.
in the course of the debate whicha followed
a variety of opinions were exipressed and the
main result was to show that the following
propositions may be taken as incontrovertable:
lst. The British America Act is the charter
of both the, Dominion of Canada and of the
provinces; their respective pawers are derived
from that Act.
2nd. The Confederation Act, especially the
Constitution of the Senate, was the resuit of
a compromise in the nature og a treaty among
the four original provinces, Ontario, Quebee.
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, implying
a surrender by each of powers of their own
whicha were to become tliose of the Dominion
of Canada.
3rd. Unless by abuse of~ authority and viollatiait of vested constitutional rights, no change
in or amendruent to thse Constitution can now
ha muade altering at aIl thse compromise or
treaty arrived at in 1867, without the consent
of each Province.
4th. Under the Britishs Norths America Act,
1867, thse powers of thse Sonate and the powers
of thse House of Commons are co-extensive
even in money Bis, with tise unique exception that sucis Bills must originate in the
House of Commons.
The Minister of Justice, in his brilliant address on thse motion, supyported, if 1 amn not
mistaken, each of these -propositions, and ho
seemed ta receive thse aýsent of aîl thse other
members who spoke on tise question.
This is tise first time that the 4th proposition,
which was the finding of a special committoe
of thse Senate during the Session of 1918, roceivos the approval of tise Minister of Justice
and 1 may say of tise bouse of Commons.
The honourable member for West Calgary
claî.med tisat this House hias failed ta protect
provincial or minority rights. The assertion
was no douht made in good faitis because
tise honoura:ble gentleman bas not had the
opportunity of following tise pro-ceedings of
this House. I could take the Statutes from
year to year ever aince I have been in this
Chamber and show numerous instances where
Hon. Mr. BBIQUE.

thé 8enate was instrumental in protecting the
rights of the provinces.
For the puipase of hrevity I will restrict
myrself on. this point to the rieading of à
letter which. was addressed to mue on the Sth
of May by the distinguished Law Clerk of the
Senate. I asked Mr. Creightonb ta have the
kindness to look into the several instances
which I gave him. However, as wilýl appear
from bie letter, because of the destruction
of the Minutes at the time of the fire in the
oMd Parliament Buildings, it was difficult ta
trace the exact record. The letter is as
follows:
The Senate

Ottawa, 5th May, 1925.
My dear Mr. Béique:
Regarding your inquiry as to instances in wbich the
Senate by its legislative action bas been instrumental

These snay be clasailed roughly under the following
hcadings:
1. Railways.
The clauses which, after a long and camplicated
!egislative history, have crystallýized in sections 370-373
sud t 375, as to the consent of municipalities with regard
to t se construction and operation of lines along highwavs or public places, the putting ai wires across railsvays. or other wires, or across or along highways
The prevention of interierence with the -public right
to travel and the regolation ai height of wires, etc.,
etc.;

The provisions reapecting the establishmnent ai conand offices, and regulating toila and charges.

or ta obtain control oi provincial resources
The insertion in Acts ai incorporation Mf protecting

4. Religious, educational, charitable and benevolent corporations and associations.

regard ta Property and Civil Rights.
Inîstances ai the Senateas action with respect ta tIse

As regards educational inatters the instances are also
numerous, accurring mostly in connection with religiaus
and charitable associations. Two oi speciaî importance

~

As I aaid a moment ago, I could myseif
trace a great number of instances. Relieurable members of this House will remember
that for sevèrgt1 years after the beginning of the
centtury-frein 1902 of my own knowledgethese things were the subI ect of discussion and
contention with the House of Cominons. They
finally gave in, and that spirit has been
crystallized in st andard -billr-railway bills,
bills for the incorporation of trust companies,
and bills of ail kinds-and now the contentiopts are flot at ail what they were at that
âime.
The honoursble member for Granville (Hou.
Mr. Chapais) gave us a number of instances
in which this House had saved a great amount
of xnon.ey to the country, and the honourable
the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Sir James
Lougheed) completed the review when hie referred to the Bengough Branch Line Bill and
the Turtieford Branch Line Bill. His remarks were surnmed up in this paragraph:
The sumxxrtion of the. wiiole transaction la this:
Piovision was made i the. twe Bills of last session ta
expend S16,019,000 upon the. construction of 220 miles
of road we are now satisfying the. publie b>' this logislation with an expenditure of 11,615,000 instead of 86,010,000, thua effectdng a savxna te the. country of
84,404,000.

Now, I desire to record that in 1919, when
the Grand Trunk Acquisition Bill was passed,
this Heuse was instrumental, by the introduction of a clause which I had the honour to
move at the time, in saving a very large
amount to the country. It ie difficuit to ascertain what t-hat amount was, but it muet
have been a very large one. I prefaced the
motion by the following remarks which are
to be found on page 373 of Hansard of 1919:
1 arn afraid that the. Bill drafted, and particularl>'
clause Il, would imply that the, Governrnent assumes

Thte gopioureble the leader of the

Oppogi-

tion, who waýs then the leader of the Rouge,
.Very kindly accepted the amepidment which
was incorporated in the sehedul'e of chapter
13 of the Act of 1920, in these worda:
19. G.T.P. Guarantee and Claims.-Fpr tiie purpose

If it ha4d net been for thie clause I ara
sati4fed that the arbitrators, instead cf decaring that the stock cf the shareholders was
worth nothing at ail, would have awarded a
large amount.
It is well that we should take th" occasion
to let the country know a little of whist
t.his Ilouse je doixig at times. A vu.iety of
opinions have been expressed frein time tei
turne in this honourable House and elsewhere
as to the best mode of appointment or
selection cf the members cf the Senate, 'but
always ending ini a striking absence cf anything like unity cf opinions. If, as is suggested by some, the niembers cf the Senate
were ehected by the people, it would make
of it a second Huse cf Commons. Its members would have an equal right with the members cf that bouse te dlaim that they were
expressing the will cf their 4electors, and
it would tend te create dangerous confVots
between the two chambers. If, as çlaimed by
other.9, they were nominated by the -provincial
legislatures, the choice would very likely be
limiteçi te politlcians naturally inclined te keep
ini close contact, at heast with those cf the members of the body who had favoured their

In one case as in the other, if
one politieal party remwined in a large majority
in one or more provinces for a long period,
al the members cf the Senate from suth
provinces would l*kely be of the sarce politioaI
faith. It would niake for dÂseunioii between

JUNE 16, 1925
In closing these remarks, let me say that I
have reached an age when I can have no
personal interest in the matter, but when
it may be my duty to express my opinion.
I am now in my twenty-fifth session, and,
like other members of the House, I have
given a great deal of thought to the question
as to whether the Constitution of the Senate
should not be changed. I must confess that
I have arrived at the conclusion that the
constitution of the Senate is what it should
be, and that it had better be left alone.
Like all. human institutions, it is imperfect,
often deserving criticism, but my experience
is that on any vital question a majority may
always be depended upon to solve it in the
best interests of the country.
Hon. J. H. LEGRIS (Translation): May
I be permitted to occupy a few minutes of
the time of this honourable House to make
some remarks that are naturally suggested
to me by the eloquent speeches which we
have heard from the lips of the honourable
Senators who have discussed the motion now
before us.
I must in the first place congratulate my
honourable friend from Bathurst (Hon. Mr.
Turgeon) on his excellent idea of submitting
this motion to the House. I congratulate my
honourable friend from Granville (Hon. Mr.
Chapais), as well as the honourable Senator
from Middleton (fon. Mr. Ross) and my
honourable friend from De Salaberry (Hon.
Mr. Béique), on the eloquent speeches they
have made in this Chamber on the question
of the Senate. They have each given us a
course in constitutional law on this subject.
My honourable friend from Granville, in
the learned address which he made a few
days ago, absolutely refuted the argument
invoked in another place and in some newspapers for the reform, even the abolition, of
The honourable gentleman
the Senate.
enumerated the various countries of the world
which are now under a constitution like ours
and in which there are two Chambers.
Canada would therefore be alone in taking
the risk of having only a single Chamber,
whereas, for reasons which are well known,
it has greater need of a second Chamber than
any ather country in the long list enumerated
by my honourable friend.
This is sufficient, I believe, to refute the
arguments of those who would reform or
even abolish the Canadian Senate without
having given adequate study to the objections growing out of constitutional difficulties
which would arise, or to the needs of the
country, with its heterogeneous population

503

and its peculiar composition. I know that
the most popular reasons advanced against the
Senate are that its members do not perform
enough work and that it is too expensive.
To the first objection I answer that the Senate
has always fulfilled the duties assigned to it
by the Constitution of the country. In the
next place, I may say, I have no confidence
whatever in the different schemes for reform
which have been suggested, especially those
which would result in identifying this
Chamber more or less with the House of
Commons.
As to what it costs the country, my honourable friend from Granville has specified some
of the very grave erro of administration and
legislaition committed by the Government and
the House of Commons and which the Senate
has corrected. thus saving considerable sums
of money, far exceeding all that the Senate
has cost in the past and all that it may cost
for many years ta come.
My honourable friend from Granville has
mentioned that in 1874 a Bill for the construction of a line of railway from Equimalt to
Nanaimo was rejected by the Senate and
heard of no more. That railway line would
certainly have cost a few millions and would
have added a new burden to that w1hich we
already bear-a burden which would have
been too heavy and have kept the country
crushed beneath delts and taxes almost
unbearable.
My honourable friend has cited another
Bill, authorizing the construction of a road
from Atlin to Dawson City, in the Yukon.
The cost of that road was estimated at three
millions, and it would probably have reached
five or six millions. That is the usual experience in railway construction.
There was
another considerable sum saved to the country by the action of the Senate.
Later, in 1913, the Senate rejected the Bill
for the construction of three dreadnoughts.
The amount mentioned was thirty-five
millions, and there is no doubt whatever that
the expenditure would have reached fifty
millions and we should have had another
white elephant to feed. The Senate prevented
the expenditure of these millions of Canada's
money.
My honourable friend cited also the Bill
for the construction of 29 railway branch
lines, which the Senate rejected two years ago.
Some of the proposals have been considered
necessary, and these the Government submitted
again, in the following Session, and the Senate
approved of them. Here again the Senate

saved an unneceasary expenditure of several
millions.
Therre are a large number of ather Buis,
of lesser impoTtance, which have flot been
mentioned and whieh I will flot name, as I
do flot wish. to detain this honourable flouse
more than a few minutes. But there occurs
to me this reflection, which, it seerns to me
is quite natural. These Bis which have been
rejected by the Senate and whicha would have
]mposed upon the country enermous expense
have in all cases been defeated by a Senate
hostile to the Governrnent. It is said that
there are no party politics in this flouse,
but there are political sympathies, even if
there is no party spirit, and it is desirable
that the Senate should always have a .majority
against the Goverement. I do flot at al
believe that the Senate would place useless
obstacles in -the way of Government measures.
As t!he question of the reform or abolition
of the Senate has been under discussion, 1

1 think it wouid be very beneficial te the
Senate if a general distribution could be
made of the addresses that have been given
on this question. It would place fairly before
the roun'try the work that, the Senate docs,
and show the value of this Housc in carrying
on the business of the country.
I dýid net intend saying anything on this
resolution until I received a request a few
minutes age. I think I might refer te the
experience that I have had in the public life

of Canada. I served for somte lime in the
flouse of Commons, and was on Committees
there, and I have been 25 years in this flouse,
and on its Committees; and I thinik, withýout
any reflectien on the way the flouse of Cemments does its work, that the Senate deals
with Bills more thoroughly. We have a much
better opportunity for doinýg se here, because

by the honourable gentleman who 9poke as
te the number of Buis that had been amended
here and sent Iback te the flouse of Comanons,
who concurred in amendments made in -this
flouse, shows clearly that this flouse has a
better opportuni-ty te revise the Bills. Of
course. t.he Buis receive a certain amount of
revision after their introduction in the other
flouýse, and before they reach us, and we have
less ýwork te do in that way.
The question as te the formn of appeintment
or election of Senraters was before the Fathers
of Confederatien, and I recolleet very well
je the days before Conf ederation that we elected
a certain number of Senaters for Ijpper and
Lower ýCanada. In -the district in whicha I
lived we elected the Hon. John Simpson on
two occasions, and a certain number of
Senators were appointed. The Fatbers of Confederatien Lad before them that system, of
election, and they aIse ceuld look te the constitution of the United States and see how

Brown and his followers were persuaded
that they had obained a substantial majority
of the electors of Canada West. They were
confident that if they could secure representation by population, Canada West, or, in other
words, George Brown's Clear Grit party,
could rule the country; and accordingly, from
the time that Confederation was moo'ed, the
feature of the new constitution which was
considered of vital importance by George
Brown and his political followers wa's represeniation by pcpulation. Now. what I am coming to is simply this. We have been told as
a matter of rescarch and as a matter of history-as a matter of knowledge obtained by
reading-that Confederation, or the agreement
come to at the Quebec Conference was a
matter of compromise. Necessarily it had to
be so, and particularly of compromise, and
I moay say of bargaining upon this, Brown's,
vital point. If the majority in Upper Canada
was to be granted a substantial majori'y in the
number of representatives in the Legislative
Assembly or House of Commons, in what way
was i- possible that tîa.t condition of things
could be compensated for or counterbalanced
to the smaller Provinces, particularly to the
Provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick,
who were then proposing to enter the Union,
but equally, or in a degree equally, to the
Province of Quebec? The only possible way,
and the way that was adopted by the Fathers
of Confederation, was by the provision for
the cstablishment of a second Chamber in
which representation should be, not by population, but upon a footing of equality; and a
central feature of that proposition necessarily
was that the second Legislative Chamber
should be of equal, of co-ordinate, authority
with the popular As-embly, except upon the
one matter of the holding of the purse-strings,
and that accordingly was the compromise that
was cffected.
Now, what I rise to speak about is the way
in which that situation was represented at the
time to the ordinary voter, the rank and file
of the party led by Brown in the Province

were. I think, fairl' representative of what I
call the rank and file of the electors of Upper
Canada at that date.
This very question,
this very subject of the continuance of a
second Chamber or Upper House was, during
the time of the Quebec Conference, not only
a matter of daily readirng in the household
from the columns of the Toronto Globe, but
was a matter of daily, I might say almost

hourly, discussion between those two men,
between themselves and with neighbours
about the farm-in the fields or in the barn,
wherever they might be working-and every
word of the discussion was eagerly drunk in
on my part by willing boyhood ears. That is
the way I think I know whereof I speak when
I say that, to the members of the Clear Grit
Party in Canada West at the time of the
Quebec Conference and at the time of Confederation, it was stated by George Brown as
their leader, not merely in his public speeches
or in the columns of his newspaper, but by
personal letter, by personal conversation, by
intercourse between man and man, that no
opposition on their part ought to be ôffered
to the ereation of a Senate as an integral
part of the constitution of this country; that
it was the price of representation by population, that it was part of the bargain, and
that it ought to be accepted-and accepted it
wms.
His statement on the subject reconciled
those who previously had been unwilling to
agree to the necessity, the inevitability, of the
continuation of an Upper House under a constitution-exactly that which we have.
In
those circumstances, with a second Chamber
constituted as this Chamber is constituted,
for the very purpose of securing the rights and
protecting the interests of the minority Provinces, what other than a breach of faith
would it be if to-day a majority in any other
legislative assembly, or even a majority of the
people among the larger Provinces should
combine te take away from the smaller Provinces that measure of protection which they
stipulated for, and which at the time they
were willingly given?
But this resolution and the public discussion,
or the Speech from the Throne which has led
to the introduction of this legislation, does not
bring up, at present at any rate, any question
of the continuation of the existence of this
Chamber; and in these circunmstances it seems
premature to discuss it or perhaps even to
refer to it.
This resolution strikes at the
very root of the matter and deals practically
with exactly that which we have before us.
I need not refer to anything that has taken
place in the country prior to the opening of

would scarcely de, because the selection of
the members of this Heuse by appointment
was an essential feature of the very propositien that this House should be constituted
as a protector of the interests of smaller
Provinces of er minoritiee in the State. How
ceuld any minority, whether of race or creed

would there be in any Province of a, minority

But that is, in a sense, aside; that is net
now, at any rate, a praotical suggestion -for

Just oe word more, which, I think I may
say, without impropriety, as a representative
of Ontario. That province is now, and has
been since Gonfederation, the most populous
of our provinces. It now possesses, as it has
always pessassed since Cenfederation, a substantâil majority in the House of Commons.
It needs no protection: the majority can
always look alter itself. But would it flot be
well that anv citizen of Ontario should
refleet, and reffect n-ew, that this condition
of thing in regard to Ontario mnav fot always
obtain? Probably not in my lifetime, possibly
flot in the lifetime of anyone now within the
sound of my voice, will Ontario lose its
primary position as the most populous of our
provinces; but very likely that dpy will ultimately coma, and if the constitution of the
Senate is te be changed at the present time
in this respect, Ontario may sce the day when
it will be one of the minority provinces, and
whan it would have been glad to have had
its representation in the Senate one of equality
which, with its co-ordinate jurisdiction with
that of the Gommons, would have been able
te protect, if need were, the in.terests of
Ontario.
Upon ail grounds, it seems to me, we, as
members of this Chamber, might be unanimous
in passing this resolution, which simply
declares it to be inexpedient, in Our opinion,
that in the conference which is now contempl'ated any change in the constitution of
the country which would affect the powers of
the Senate should be made unless with the
unanimous consent of the smaller Provinces,
which stand te be injured by it.
Hon. WýM. ROCHE: Honourable gentlemen, 1 have listened with close attention to

the Senate, and they are indifferent about it.
Ail they know of it is an occasional jibe i
sonie obscure country paper, and I believe
their idea of the Senate is that Senators are
men that are senile, sitting in sybaritie ease,
wbo corne in, adjourn, amuse theniselves, and
do nothing else but draw their pay. There
has been a wash of sentiment from another
Chamber leading, perbaps, to the abolition of
the Senaýte or in ýfact an intimation that if
the Senate does nlot behiave itself it may be
either limited or altogether abôlished.

the utmost amount of Roman dignity, debating the questions that caýme bedfore them. providing for the publie service, intimt:ng wbat
military forces tbey had, and going on calmly
in the diseharge of their senatorial duties,
altogether undisturbeid by the clashing of the
swords upon the shieIds, and the outeries of
the Goths. Dismnayed by the calmness of the
Senators, who were so little affected by their
clamours or the threats made upon them.
the Goths retreated and left the Senate to
the discharge of their duties. So it rnay be
with those iconoclasts who wish to corne in
and abolish the .Senate, but who, if they
should corne in, would leave the Senate to
its deliberations. Suppose that sorne members
of the fouse of Commons, wbo are so disposed te underrate the pretensions and deliberations of the Senate, should be invited in
on Wednesday. We rnight provide sorne
accommodation for them, and if they should
corne :in and observe the dignity of debates,
the courtesy of speakers, the deference 'that
is made to opinions, the dispatch that is given
to business. and ail the requisites of the most
refined and elevated deliberate assem'bly, they
would alter their opinions entirely.
If thev were to go into our Comnmittee
rooms, they would sec the BilHs which are
brou.ght before thern-sometimes, it mnust, be
admitted, in a very crude state-fromn the
flouse of Cominons and they would learn
that those who discuss and inve-stigate 'those
Bills represen-t in some cases the -ablest legal
talent in the country while otiier members
of the ýCommittees are men with knowledge
of business, knowledge of corporations, maen
actively engaged themýsclves, from (varieus
portione of the country, and ail well informed
on practical suhjects which corne before the

dealing with practical measures, and that
whicb interests the comanonality osf the
people, the Coirmittees of -the Senate are
equal to any deliberative 'body of which I
have heard.
J have observed no great reluctance on the
part of many members of the flouse of Cornmens to corne over te, the Senate and take
interest in our deliberations; yet many members of the present Senate have .served their
time in 'local Legislatures, in the flouse of
Commons, in municipal bodies, and have
brought to bear upon the subjects under consideration a body of information wbich would
be unequalled in the country.
With regard to the constitution -of the
Senate, if it be altered what would be the
advantage of an elective assembly? My honourable friend who, bas spoken recently (Hon.
Mr. Beique) baýs shown that it would be a
rival body to, the Gominons; thet it might
entert-ain diverse views; that it migbt contradict or oppose or destroy meýasures which are
brought forward by the other body. But
under the present systern the people at large
elect mernbers of the flouse of Commrons. the
flouse of Commons eleots a Government; the
Governent seleets the members of the
Senate, who, arc called by the Crown, but
are really representatives of the people. They
have gone through three gradations, and it
is quite true that, although they may apparently be a selected assembly, they are rea!
representatives of the people, only tavo removes froni the people themselves, and without ail the vicissitudes that take place, without ahl the changes in the body politic, without changes of Governent, or anytbing of
that kind. The 'Senate is a staid, consistent
body without alteration, carrying forward dts
principles and traditions, executing its purposes in the very best possible mannýer as a
balance, as a consummation, and as a corrector
of what rnay be crude legisllation of the flouse
of Commons.
The Senate bas now pretty well arrived at
the end of this Sesion. Wc have passed a
number of measures; we have bad a number
of debates. During the next Session I venture
to affirni that th-e Senate will be here. I
venture also to affirm that when the flouse
of Commons disperses and there may be another lieuse of Commons, the Senate wili be
bore still. I assert that the Senate will always be bore, and carry out the traditions
and practices. and perform its duties faithfully, without fear, without regard to menaces
or tbrcats or cajolery, or any other influences
bhat may be brougbt to bear; that the Senate
of Canada wilI be the Senate of Canada wvhich

lion. R. DANDUTRAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, this resolution could well pasa thie
flouse without my rising to add snything to
what ha@ been said. This debate bas been
conducted on a 'high plane, and 1 arn sure has
interested all the members who bave had the
privilege of listening to it.
I have spoken so, often on the constitution
of the Senate and on ifs mode of selection
that I do flot feel like repeating to any degree
what I have already stat-ed. I admitted ¶nst
Session that in three or four debates in which
I had participated I had found that -at times
the debate had altered my views.
'Plie anly question to which the Senate need
give serious thought, the only grievanceagainst
which it should guard itself, is in. the appearance of a division of opinion in the Senate
on questions which clearêly divide the parties in
the country-on matters upon which the House
of Camnions bas divided on party lines; because, if the Senate occasionally shows that it
is inclined to be infiuenoed by the views and
passions which are held and displayed in the
flouse of Commons, people are apt, in those
special and rare cireumstances, to say: "Wel,
the Senate is but a replica of the flouse o;
Commons."
Speaking without any application to the
present, day, I recognize that when a party
is triumphant at the polis in a clear, decided
vote given by the people, and presents a
measure which is opposed by the defeated
party in the Commons, that party which has the
mandate of the people may feel somewhat
irritated if it happens that the defeated party
has a majotity in the Upper flouse, and that
that mai ority imposes its will upon the legislation brought forward by the party triumphant at the polls.
This is the only point in the history of
the Senate which has created some friction and
some criticism among the people, and bas influenced public opinion. Wlhen I make this
remark I -have -in mind situations such as I
could describe, that have appeared rnany a
time since Confederation. I remember that
an election was hdqd in 189M, and the Liberal
party carried that election. It faund in the
Senate, in a flouse of 81 members, only 9 or
10 representatives of Liberaiism. One can
realize the feeling of the majority party ini the
flrouae of Commons, ',when! opposed on a
meagure where the two parties had taken sides
in the Commong, meeting with diefeat be-

cause accidentally the lnajority in the Seilâte
hàppened to feel on that qUestioft as the
minority party in the other Chamnbert feU.
This happened again i 1911. When the
Conservative party oarried the élections it
found itself in thio Chamber faeing a majority,
and no doUbt tise action of that majarity ifl
this Chamber may have been very unpleasant
to the Inajority in the flouse of Commons.
It is only in those cîrcumatances, when
there is the appearance of party cleavage in
the Senate similar to the party cleavage in
the Commons, that we hear of eriticismn in
the country. Ilonourable gentlemen wiii remember that I have often expressed my view
thart party feeling in this Chamber should be
obiiterated to as great a degree as possible.
1 think that the best way of eli±ninating it
would be to eliminate the Governinent compietely froni this Chambet, so that there
wouid be no Governinent representative, no
Government party, and no Opposition pàrty.
We could administer this Htouse under a
system of having a floor managing committee,
and the fifteen or sixteen members of the
Cabinet who would bring measures forward in
the Commons cauld select their own senators
to sponsor their measures in this Chamber.
They would have the advantage of divid-ing
the work among fifteen instead of having it
concentrated on one alone.
I simpiy indicate a point in respect to which
the Sexiste is sometimes criticized. I recognize that honourable members of the Senate
are human. Consciousiy or umconsciously we
are swayed or influenced. to a certain degree
by our political affiliations or political inclinations. I bave been here for twenty-seven
years. I feel that at times party inclinations have been perhaps apparent, but that
the whoie work of the Senate session after session, bas 'heen to the great advantage of the
Dominion of Canada. Our work bas often been
done, as bas been stated thia evening, quietly
in the Committees. On the whoie, we have
brought our share of wisdom and experience
ta the framing of the laws of this country,
and the Dominion of Canada bas benefited
*by that work. There is at present fia suggestion that I could make for the betterment
of the Senate, either in its composition or
in its authority. I have seen it in operation.
I have no objection ta the passmng of this
resolution. It sirnply confirme the announcement whieh was made ini the Speech from,
the Throne, that a conference af the Federal
-Cabinet with the provincial cabinets will be
held. This resolution implies that, they being
consultèd, their décision shauld prevail, but
it goes a little turther in saying that the decision shal las unanimous. There la a qualifi-

SENATE

Cation. J

d- not know whether the honourable gentler'tn who drafted the resolution
bas noticed à,:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, it is inexpedient
that any change take place in the Constitution of
Caiiada as established by the British North America
Act and anendments thereto, as set forth in the
Speech from the Throne at the opening of the present
session of Parlianent, without the unanimous consent
of the Provinces affected by such change to be expressed by the Legislatures of the respective Provinces.

mentioned two propositions. There have been
oher suggestions made at different times.
But, for my part, I do not yet see how the
work of the Government willi be very much
improved by whatever amendment is suggested. I said last Session that there were so
m'any different opinions expressed in this
Ohamber and in another place when the question of Senate reform was under discussion,
that in despair we had agreed ta have a concrete question brought before us, in order
thait we might test it. I am stii of the same
opimon.

The qualifying words which I have just
read are: "without the unanimous consent of
the Provinces affected by such change."
Before taking my seat I would like to state
that we have hadt, since I have been in 'this
Chamber, nwo propostions for harmonizing
differences that may appear, and do occasionally appear, between the two Chambers. I am
not sure that the first one was made publie.
I an under the impression that iit was. The
date I should fix as 1897 or 1898, Mhen the
Prime Minister of the day, Sir Wilfrid Laurier,
asked tie opinion of the four original provinces
as to a change in the constitution to permit
of the adoption in this country of the Amenican system of uniting .the two branches of
Parliament in the event of a conflict, in order
that the' may vote as a single House. I
understand tiat the House of Representatives
and the Sentute have tiat method of solving
their differtnces, but I have not yet heard of
any instance in whic ki has been utilized.

t,

That power ex'ats in the Constitution of the

ihe

United States, it was the suggestion of Sir
Wilfrid Laurier to the four provinces of Ontario, Quebeî,
New Brunswick and Nova
Scotia that a similar method máight be adopted
in this counatrv.
I accompanied him when
lie subm'ited that question to the Quebec
Cab int of the time, which was presided over
b' tE late Mr. Marchand, and we received
the unanimous decision of the Cabinet that
such a change would not be favoured either
by the Cabinet or by the Provincial Legislaturc.
Lately we have had the suggestion that the
sol'ultiion of the problem of conflicts between
the two Chambers should be sought by looking, niot towards Washington, but towards
London. There will probably be subrnitted
to the next conference a question regarding
the desirability of adopting the British system.
Under that system, if a measure whieh has
been defeated twice by the Upper Chamber,
is defeated for the third consecutive time, the
dissent of the Senate does not prevail; the
Bih as passed by the Commons receives the
Royal Assent.
As honourable gentlemen are aware, the
question of solving a deadilock has engrossed
the minds of Government leaders. I have
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Before the question is voted on, honourable gentlemen, may
I suggest tiat some portions cf this resolution
ought tc be changed? As it is framed, it
implies that some amendment to the Constitution of this House is foreshadowed in
the Speech from 'he Throne. I do not think
tEe Speech from the Throne foreshadowed
anything of that scrt.
Hon. W. B. ROSS:
thing?

Did it foreshadow any-

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I was going to suggst to my honourable friend who moved the
resolution (Hon. Mr. Turgeon) that it would
uxpress his intention and would be much more
concisely and exacrly stated if it read:
That ia the opin'on of the Senate, it is inexpedient
alter the Constitution of Canada as established by
B.ritis

North America Act and amenadments there-

Whiy not leave it at that?
Hon. Mnr. BEIQUE:

As regards the Senate.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes, as regards
lie Sonate. Then the resolution would cover
everything intended. If we passed it in its
preSent forim we should be admitting something that is not so. There has been no
foreshadowing of any amendment of the
Constitution in the Speech from the Throne.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But my honcurable friend forgets the latter part of the
resolution.
I do not ihink
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
it is necessary at all. However, I am merely
making this suggestion:
That in the opinion of the Senate, it is inexpedient,
in so far as the Senate is concerned, to alter the
Constitution of Canada as established by the British
North America Act.

Hon. Mr. TURGEON: May I say a few
words in explanation? I have no objection to
the proposed change, but I had in view the
possibility that when the representatives of
the provinces were assembled they might
make changes, other than that regarding the

JUNE 16, 1925
Senate, which might affect the rights of the
different provinces.
It was for that reason
that I included the words:
Without the unanimous consent of the Provinces
affected by such change to be expressed.by the Legislatures of the respective Provinces.

A change might affect one province and not
affect another.
Hon. Mr. CHAPAIS: It is much better to
leave it as it was originally.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I point out
to my honourable friend the Senior member
for Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) the statement on this subject contained in the Speech
from the Throne? It reads:
You will be asked to sanction the calling of a conference between the federal and provincial governments
to consider the advisability of amending the British
North America Act with respect to the constitution and
powers of the Senate.

It would seem to me that that does indicate
or foreshadow some change in the British
North America Act as regards the Senate's
powers.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No. It foreshadows a conference; and in anticipation of
that conference we say we do not think there
is any necessity for alteration. I thought
that was the meaning of the resolution.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I would like to ask
a question of the honourable leader of the
Government, for information only. If I
understand it aright, the ad'option of this motion would mean that every province, through
its legislature, would have to consent to any
change in the Constitution.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF:
And "unanimous
consent" would mean consent by a majority of
the legislature.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No; it means
unanimity.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Then you might as
well say that for the next thousand years
there can be no possible change made, because
you could never get the members of each of
the nine provincial legislatures to agite
unanimously to any change.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The nine would
be unanimous.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: It wiould, to my
mind, work out in this way. Suppose that in
the course of time there arose a general
public demand for some change in the Constitution as regards the Senate. Take the
smallest province, Prince Edward Island. I do
not remember the exact number of members

511

in their Legislature. If one of those members
objected, that would prevent any possible
change in the Constitution of the Senate. I
would like to know if I am right in that
interpretation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Not exactly. I
have just drawn the attention of the Senate
to the qualifying words:
Without the unanimous
atlected by such change.

consent

of the Provinces

If Prince Edward Island is opposed to a
change which cannot at all affect that province, the consent of Prince Edward Island
would not bc required by this resolution, as
I interpret it.

FRUIT BILL
COMMONS DISAGREEMENT TO SENATE
AMENDMENTS

The Hon. the SPEAKER informed the
Senate that he had received the following
message from the House of Conmons:
Resolved that a message be sent to the Senate to
acquaint Their Honours that this House disagrees to
their amendments to Bill 117, an Act to amend the
Fruit Act, for the following reasons:
Because (a) it refers to an association by a wrong
tille;

(b) the holding of consultations with an association
whose membership is recruited from all points in
Canada may often be very difficult and even impossible;
(c) the mere faot of consulting such a body would
not bring actual results and seems an unnecessary condition.

lon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, there was a slight amendment
made in Committee to this Bill, at the suggestion of an honourable member of this
Chamber. Section 2 of the Bill read in part
as follows:
The Minister, with the approval of the Governor in
Council, shall have power to prescribe addîtional grades
for individual kinds of fruit.

After the word "Minister" we had inserted
the words "after consulting the Horticultural
Council of Canada and."
The honourable
member who made the suggestion laid it before the Committee, but did not seem to be
pressing for its inclusion after he had heard

SENATE

112

the explanations of the Deputy Minister of
Agriculture; but we did not think there was
any harm in including it. We now realize
that there was an error in the title given the
Council, and, after consultation with the honourable gentleman who moved the amendment (Hon. Mr. Smith), I am in agreement
with him in moving that the Senate doth not
insist upon its amendments.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: There are three objections to the amendments. The first is that
the title of the Horticultural Council is
slightly reversed-it is the difference between
tweedle-dum and tweedle-dee-apparently it
should have been the Canadian Council of
Horticulture. That difficulty I presume might
be remedied by a conference between the
Senate and the Commons.
The second objection is that the Council
meets only once a year, and that it would
be difficult for the Department to consult with
the Council. There is some virtue in that
objection, and I am not pressing the amendment. It seems to me a very strange thing,
however, that the House of Commons should
think that the Department could not by any
means take the advice of that Council, which
was appointed for the very purpose of giving
advice, and no other purpose so important,
and that the Department must continue to
make regulations without reference to that
important body.
The third reason for objection is that it
would not bring results, which means that the
amendment provided for the taking of advice only, and did not give the Council
authority to over-ride the regulations of the
Department. I had no intention of suggesting that the Horticultural Council should
over-ride the Department, but that it should
perform the function for which it is appointed.
However, as the House of Commons opposes the amendments, and as there is some
virtue in the second objection, I withdraw.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It may be some
satisfaction to the honourable gentleman te
know that the draftsman -of those regulations
has stated to the Committee that he had consulted with this very Association.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, that
the Senate doth not insist on its amendments,
was agreed to.
SUSPENSION OF RULES
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: At six o'clock
I gave notice of motion for the suspension of
rules. I now intend to ask the leave of the
Senate to transform that notice into a motion,
because the matter is pressing. I am in agreeHon. Mr. DANDURAND.

The purpose of the suspension of those

freely the right of everyone to put his
grievance and his cause before a member of
Parliament in either House, and to urge it with
ail possible earnestness. At the same time, I
claim for myself, as I think aIl of us do, the
right to exercise my own best judgment and
come to such decision as I think is necessary
and wise under the circumstances.

obligation upon an individual or corporation
or Government to meet it with at least compensatory damages or compassionate relief.
But the moral claim is succeeded by another, which runs al through the latter part
of the discussions and processes through which
this matter bas passed: that is what might be
called a war claim. That is, the country was
engaged in war, and therefore certain things
were not done that might have been done
if a state of war had not existed; consrquently
the loss which accrued is a war loss, and the
country should look upon it as a war loss,
and give total or partial compensation.
Le' us carry out an analysis, to a certain
extent, of this argument that the loss should
be treated as a war loss. Just here let me
say that I have been bothered, as have been
other members of this House, to know just
exactly what is upon the record with reference to the disposition and attitude of Sir
Thomas White at the time, taking into consideration the fact that the country was in a
state of war. It bas been said that it is clear
that if Sir Thomas White had not been
greatly impressed and influenced by the fact
that the country was at war, and that an outside investigation might have imperilled the
conduct of the war, a different action would
have been taken by him, and consequently the
loss would not have occurred. I have looked
into that point as carefully as I possibly
could, and read what bas been stated, as it
appears on the record, and my own belief
is that Sir Thomas White acted under the
circumstances in a perfectly fair and honest
way; that he did what ho thought was bis
duty under the circumstances; and that no
man living can go through that evidence and
make himself certain of the conclusion that
Sir Thomas White was actuated mainly, or to
a directing point, because* the country was in
a state of war. That is my observation with
reference to that matter.
But, granting that the country was in a
s'ate of war, as it was, and granting that that
had an influence upon the bosses which accrued afterwards, we are bound to analyze
that question. and examine into that alleged
reason as a claim for compensation. My bonourable friend who leads the Government in
this House ratier tried to give the impression
-perhaps ho holds it himself-that the public
as a rule finds it very difficult to understand
and master the intricacies of the Bank Act.
I will agree with him in that general statement, but when it comes tc narrow that down
to the particular provisions of the Bank Act
whch deny guarantee by the Government of
the safety of deposits, these are provisions
S-33

515

of the Bank Act that, if anything is known in
this country, are known widely and well by
the people who have to do with banks. The
occurrences of the last few years-the Farmers
Bank failure, for instance-brought that matter very clearly before the attention of large
bodies of our people. But I do not think it is
necessary to labour that. I do think we can
fairly say that of all the prcvisions of public
acts which enter into the daily transactions
of life there is none, perhaps, which i, more
widely and better known than that the depositor who puts bis money into a bank does
so at bis own risk, and that the Government
is in no way responsible for any loss which
may occur.
Just here let me say that the term
"depositor" bas, I think, been a bit misused
or misunderstood in this whole matter. Although having some knowledge of the Bank
Act and of its provisions, I had a fleeting and
hazy idea-mnybe more than fleeting and
hazy-that in all the preparation of the Bill of
to-day the bona fide depositor was the only
man whose interest was at stake and for
whom dlaims were being admitted. But what,
in general, is a depositor in the bank? He ýis
the customer of a bank. He goes into that
bank and makes bis investment. He puts in
his money and draws bis interest. But there
are differences in degrees. Some depositors
take their litt'le earnings, or their larger
earninigs, and they want them in a comparatively safe place where they wili bring a certain revenue. They take ýthet sum of their
savings and place it in the bank, in one respect for safe keeping, but also for the return
of a reasonable interest on the amount. It is
an investment by them. That is one 'dlass of
depositor. But that is not the definition that
limits depositors in this Bilil. If honourable
gentlemen look into what is meant in this Bill
by depositor, what is meant by relief to
depositors, they wihi find that "depositors" in
this case take in a far wider class than that;
that it takes in every customer of the bank,
with the exception of a Government or a bank
or a corresponding bank. Therefore we have
not the same drain upon our sympathies with
reference to the every day man of business
who has an account in the bank, and who
sometimes bas an advance from the Bank and
sometimes a balance in bis favour, that he
shail h blooked upon as a 'compassionate subject, and that the country should come to bis
rescue and aid. Under this BiI that is absolutely and actually done.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But my honourable friend will realize that this is a matter

SENATE
for the committee stage, not for the second
readiag.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER:
My honourable friend will also realize that
the Government have for months cogitated
upon and incubated their Bilh, and that their
Bi'lh is the final expression of the Government,
so :far as we know, and that when it came te
us it bid us make a forced loan upon the
people of this whole country in order to pay
proportionabteily the millionaire as well as the
small depositor of a ,few savings in the
savings bank where he lest his money. And I
am bound te take it that the honourable gentleman is here to fulfil the purpose of his
Government. He has not brought the Bil
down t t;he Senate and asked for the second
reading only to shelter himself behind the
statement that this will be all changeid in the
Committee. I can only take the straight
statement and proposition of the 'Government.
,Now. while I have as big a heart and as
great a sympathy as anyone for the small
holder of a few years' savings who has
deposited them in the bank and lost, I have
no compassionate sympathy at all for the
business man, for the millionaire, for the man
of means, who has put his means there and
has lest, but who has yet plenty te live upon
and does net need either the charity or the
forced relief of the country.
When we come to look into this business as
regards doss under the war, and compensation
for loss because of the war, we have to extend
our sympathies a littile bit, I think. There
are others who have suffered on account of
the war. We have got to take in more than
one class. There are other poor families from
one end of this country to the other to-day
who, because of that war, are living in poverty
and want, but for whom we are net asked, to
pour out from the fountains of our sympathies. In expressing our sympathies for those
who have lost by the war, we are confined te
one class and te one class only. My honourable friend who leads the Opposition (Hon.
Sir James Lougheed) warned some of us
against too much coldness in looking at this
matter, particularly the men of the East, who
were outside of the warm atmosphere which
is found in some other places in this Dominion. He warned tlhose cold hearted men
that they should get into the sunlight, as it
were, and become warmed up by circumstances
of a local kind, and then their sympathies
would be enla.rged. Is net the rejoinder
pertinent that perhaips some people who are
close to tie hot centres might be helped to
a more judicial view bv an infusion of cool
lon. Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

judgment away from the heated centres?
Well, just to ask a plain English question
about it: who are interested in the passage
of this Bil? My honourable friend to my
right gave us a fairly ýcomiprehensive statement as to those who were interested-60,000
depositors, he said, but prolbably 200,000
people who in the end would be affected if
this Bill were passed, or were not passed.
Granted that you have 200,000 persons who
are interested in the passage of this Bill,-let me state it in a plain English )phrase-interested personally and selfishly in the passage
t
oi ·his Bil. If this Bill passes they wi-ll draw
money from the public funds; if the Bill does
not pass ýthey will' not dra.w those moneys
fiom the public funds. Let them have every
t
right te their *dlaim that · heir consciences and
their circumstances warrant, yet i't is a selfish
not necessariýly a wrongful interest that they
have in this legislation.
Now, as regards those circles, the atmosphere
is decidedly warm. I know it; we know it;
whoever has received heaps of telegrams and
letters asking us not to desert them at this
fatal and trying moment knows it. It is
particularly warm there. But subtract, if you
like, 200,000 people from 9,000,000 people, and
you have some 8,800,000 people left in this
Is the atmosphere
Dominion of Canada.
particularly warm amongst thosa 8.800.000?
Those 8,800,000 are not pressing for this legislation; speaking generally, every man, woman
and child of those 8,800,000 people has borne
his burden and his losses on account of the
war, and is bearing them to-day; and the
passage of this Bill is nothing more nor less
than a forced loan put upon those 8.800,000
of the people of this country in order to
satisfy the claims, of the nature that I have
described, of the 200,000 persons.
Now, that is a statement which I think cannet be greatly questioned, and it ought te
sink into our minds and have its true weight.
But how about others? Are there net others.
as I have said, who are sitting in the shadow
to-day in this wide Dominion of Canada, and
who have lest and lest heavily in money, in
profit. in future prospects, as well as in other
But
more intimate and important ways?
these others to-day find no Government corning forward and no Parliament ready to say
that though they have no money of their own,
being poverty-stricken in revenues and with
tremendous liabilities ahead of them, they are
prepared to be sympathetic towards them and
to show it by raising money by loan to satisfy
the losses they have made.
Just here, whilst it is fresh in mv mind, I
want to utter my protest against the vicious
kind of financing adopted in this Bill. Who

JUNE 17, 1925
does not know the type of man who is
always financing his affairs by the easy giving
of promissory notes, as long as they will be
accepted, and who feels that he bas conquered
the difficulty when be has floated a note or
has given his promise to pay? I want to
ask this House whether that is the type of
man who is a safe economizer and financier,
a safe manager of a business?
When a
prudent man has before him the ronsideration
of an expenditure, he asks himself, "Am I able
to afford it? Have I the ready money?" If
the answer is negative, as a rule be denies
himself. What is true of the individual is
truc

of business corporations,

and

it is

in-

trinsically and fundamentally true of Parliament. Surely a Parliament should not finance
itse!f by 1oans for charitable purposes or
for fleeting and incidental
requirements.
Loans are satisfactory as a method of
procedure in great enterprises which promise
productive results, and sometimes even in
necessary enterprises when they'do not promise
such results. But as a rule a Government in
its financina operations must be strictly held
to its possibilities of present payment, and it
must eut its garment according to its cloth.
The expenditures of a country must bear close
relation to its revenues. But how easy it is,
how shiftless and how shifting it is, for a
Government to say: "Yes, it is true that we
have no surplus, that we are up to the limit
of possible taxation, and that the peeple will
bear no more; but here is an expenditure
demanded but for which we have not the
money, and for which we do not wish to
increase the taxes; we will not take the onus
of including it in the Supply Bill and facing
the deficit manfully, but will make a loan and
throw the responsibility upon the shoulders of
the present generation and the generation that
comes after." If that principle is adopted in
Parliamentary finance, the first step is taken
on the road tovars financial ruin.
Take the history of this Parliament and
its precedents; look through all the appropriations which have been given for what may
be called sympathetic or compassionate purposes. Do you find a single instance in which
the Government has voted a sum towards
relief after a great disaster or a local calamity, and then put a loan upon the market in
order to pay it? That is what the Government is doing in this case, and that, to my
mind, is foelowing out a system of financing
which can only speli ruin id it be persisted
n.
I was going on te say that other people
than the depositors in the Home Bank have
suffered on account of the war. I spoke of
several classes. This feature bas been alluded

517

to already in this debate, but it is important
enough to be alluded to a second time. What
are the otfher classes who have suffered by
reason of the war?
The farmers of this
country have suffered because of the war. Na
man went up and down this country trying
to persuade people te put their deposits in
the Home Bank; but men in every rank of
life, from the highest te the lowest, went
through this country and pleaded with the
farmers to put their money, their muscle,
their profits for the future, into the agricultural work of producing, and producing, and
producing.
The farmers did this, for their
own gain, but for patriotic purposes as well.
Now, what happened?
The war went on,
and when it suddenly closed, the result was
that in a trice those farmers found the prices
of their produce reduced to one-third of what
they had been when they put their muscle
and their money into the land to produce
the result asked for. But if they founsd that
the prices of their produce were reduced, they
did net find their expenses equaliy reduced.
They went on for months and years before
their expenses were reduced. What happened? The result is, to put it broadly, that
lm this country to-day there are not simply
60,000 who deposited their moncy and brawn
and muscle in the great bank of agriculture,
neot 60,000 nor 100,000 alone who are affected
but all through the length and breadth of
this country, from one end te the other,
farmers to-day are to be found in comparatively straitened circumstances because there
wvas a war and because they met the calls
that were made upon them. And what good
Samaritan, what largely sympathetic person
las come to either the House of Commons
or the Senate and has asked that a number
of millions of dollars should be borrowed and
paid out te these farmers te reimburse them
for the losses they ineurred because of the
war?
Others than farmers have been in the same
position.
Consider the professional men.
Lawyers closed their chambers and locked
their doors, went overseas and fought in the
war and came back after having ir.curred the
perils of war, only te find 'that their clients
had gone te others and that their former
relatively
good businesses
were entirely
destroyed and that they had te commence
anew. The same is true of doctors, coillege
professors and teachers. Tens and hundreds
aind thousands of them did that and came
back. They suffered, and they still suffer
from the effects of the war, but I do net find
any Bill presented te Parliament te compensate them for those losses which would

My hû&nourýWe friend there (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) says that if we had had the
legisiation which was paissed in 1924 and which
we now have, we should not have h*ad this
crash. How does he know? No one know..
Put on whatever inspection yiou like; tihe
human element is stili in the bank and you
are nlot absoluteiy fortified against lýoss, nor
will you ever be; and if by ingenuity of
reasoning you can find grounds now, under the
present inspection, for holding the Government morally, if not legally, responsible for
loas, you may depend upon it that ingenuity
will not be lessenied in the future, and that
one step in thjs direction will lead to another.
I think that my honourable friend here
showed a sign of dissent to my honourable
friend opposite in referenice to that remedial
My honor restrictive legislation of 1924.
ourable friend to my right (Hon. Mr. RobertMy honourson) called it fool legisiation.
able friend yonder declared that it would
preserve us from any recurrence of a difficulty such as we have had. My honourable
friend the leader of the Opposition (Hon. Sir
James Lougheed) took exactlv the same view.
Ilere is a difference. a difference between
authorities. But the trend is shown when MY
honourable friend here would do away with
the act of 1924 and its accompanying assertion
that the Governiment did not, by putting on

He would tear that down and make it ail the
mûre easy for dlaims to he urgad along the

the trend, and to that trend we give a decided

impetus if we pass this legisiation.
my view in this respect.
Now, let me go to two other points, witb
which I shall conclude what I have to say
to-day. It has been well said by someone in
this debate that cirdumstances make it easier
in certain times to do a sympathetie and
compensatory act, which would be almost impossible under other circumstances. If the
Treasury is flush, if you have a reasonable
taxation and it is flot an over heavy burden,
and if you wish to launch into schemes that
are flot absolutely necessary or legally required, you have a lîttie more leeway in
which to do it than under other circumstances.
1 put it to eaeh honourable member in this
Chamber, as I put it to myself: what are
the financisi and economie conditions in
Canada to-day? We say them over and over
again until they becomne like pattering ramn,
on rock, which may have some effeet in the

long run, but whieh has not much at the
precise time it, falls. We say we are labouring
under an enormous debt-and we are. It is
neot a faible: it is flot a pipe dream. The
debt is theire, and it is two billions and a
half ol dollars for laine millions of people.
Let us consider what that means, comparatively. When we went into the war over
eight millions of people owed 333 millions
of a debt. Now nine millions of people
owe a debt of two and a hall billions; and
that means a burden of interest and the
obligation to repay at some time or other.
Is not that debt sufficiently high to-day?
.Here is a Bill which proposes to add five
and a hall millions of dollars to it. Is it
reasonable toi say that, with a Treasury depleted, with a debt of such stupendous magnitude and an intolerable rate of taxation,
whieh must be paid in order that we rnay
carry on- is it reasonable to say that we
should rush into an additional five and a haîf
millions of debt, to be added to our burden,
,unless it is necessary and a'bsolutely justifiable? I think we have to consîder that
point.
But that is not all. Men may refrain from
talk because sometimes it is not wise to
talk overmuch and outright. We are alI
.iealous of the good name of Canada. We do
not want to say a word, here or elsewbere,
which may be used against Canada and may
have inside the country a depressing effect
,and outside the country a competitive effeet.
But we must not blind our eyes to the facts.
We have alongside of us for our whole frontier
a vastly strong, powerful, and attractive nation. It bas always drawn, it does now draw,
and it always will draw, in a competitive way,
uapon the people and the resources of Canada.
We ought not to make between our country
and that a contrast any greater than it now
is. Look at what is being done on the other
sîde. With a tenacity of purpose and a
shrewdness unexampled, under President
H{arding as a commencement, under President Coolidge as a continuation, that country
has deliberately set itself to, two things. One
is to diminisb by hundreds of millions each
year its public expendîture until it has drawn
it down pretty nearly one-haîf since the Armistice. Take that into account. That is followed by the remission and reduction of taxation. The income tax in the United States
of America, when another year is passed,
wihl have been eut almost into hall. Neither
tbe debt nor the income tax of Canada is being
cut to any appreciable extent. Our debt is
piling up year by year. The other country
shows ail its advantages and a debt decreasing by millions year by year. More than

20

SENATE

$300,000,000

was struck off their debt last
year. Nearly that amount will be remitted
in taxation this year. The contrast is not in our
favour. If there was a magnet in the United
States before, in lessened debt, lessened taxation, and consequently easier methods of living, its powers of attraction are n'ow heightened.
What are we doing to reduce the contrast?
Do we expect that, if that contrast persists
and increases, our people will not feel more
and more the attraction towards the other
side of the line and its influence on our re,sources? You cannot blind your eyes to
,that. No sophisims and no pleasant words
will do away with that fact.
Go out into your rural communities. Sit
down beside your doctor and ask him how
many certificates be bas made out during the
last year-the last month-the last week-for
Canadians who are crossing to the other side,
and woli must obtain those certificates as a
sine qua non to entry into the United States.
You will get the answer. Go to your parishl
priests. your curés, your clergymen, and yo3
will rece ive the same answer. Go to your
Minister of Colonization in the Province of
Queboecand a-k him what is his experience in
this respect, and you will find that it is on
the sanie line. This is a vital question. We
,must reintegrate our affairs. We must bring
our expenditures nearer to an equality with
our revenues, if we cannot reduce them ta
something below. Unless we do, as surely as
the years pass by, we shall feel the effects
of thati magnetie attraction.
Now, I think it is the duty of this Senats
te stand over all proposed expenditure, and
use its united influence, strongly, persistently
and consistently, to do away with that disparity which is prejudicial to our present, and
may easily be fatal to our future-certainly
fatal to tiat progrcss we expected te be made
within a certain lapse of time.
We in this Senate and the members in the
House of Commons are not exactly free te
ase our individual preferences and wishes. and
exercise our individual sympatby. I praise
and honour the man of broad and wide and
warm sympathies, for without a human heart
the man himself is a temple without an altar,
a thing xwithout a soul; but I say that in the
main these human sympathies of ours are to
be expended by our individual acts, and not
by the vote of a Parliament, taking the money
of the country and expending it along sympathetic lines. I say that we are here as members of the Senate in charge of a trust. Those
moneys that come in to us are not our moneys.
In almost every act we must ta a certain extent infuse into our parliamentary work the
lon. Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

heart of humanity, with humanness and with
warmth; but there is a certain point we dare
not pass and allow our sympathies te run
away with our trust duties. If we ever had a
trust duty, that duty to-day is to stand firm
and strong against all expenditures that are
not absolutely and vitally necessary.
I have had sheafs upon sheafs of telegrams and letters, as you have all had. After
all, we are bound te exercise our duties in
this House, as in the other House, as trustees
for the future of our country, and trustees
especially of its money and financial resources.
Consequently I ask myself the question:
*
what is my duty in this particular matter?
Under all the circumstances, as I have roughly
reviewed them, is it to add five and a balf
millions more to the sum of our debt, our
burdens and our liabilities, or is it to curb
our own natural sympathies as indivicials, and
do what is just and right for our country
and its larger interests?
Who called this failure of the Home Bank
a national disaster? It has been so called,
vet it is everything else than a national disater. How can we exaggerate language in that
way? There might have been a national
disascr if all the banks in this country had
gone crashing. or nigih te crashing; that would
h ave tlrea teonod a national discaister. This is
simply a local disaster. hard enough in many
of the cases,. in the Ilocalitics where it opierated.
Our sa out hies are stirred, our human feelings
*
are wirotihit uaon, for in those localities there
is trouble; but we must make the general
cquation, anid -proaid our thoughts and our
simtpathies over the wole of Canada. What
I rebel against more than anything else is the
iiiustic, the absoute lack of any just foundation, capon whiîch this legislation is proposed
to be put into practical operation. Is it a
compassionate allowarice?
Then the help
should go to the most need- cases. Is there
any doubt about that? But in this Bill there
is no distinction made as to need and degree of conpassionate relief. Your millionaire
lad his account with that Bank; sometimes he
had an advace, sometimes the opposite. At
the time the B:unk broke he bad 83.000 or
84.000 to his credit in the Bank. Yet ho is
one of your distressed and compassionatelyconsidered depositors; and I am asked, and
you are asketd, and men whio have had their
own sufferings and made their own losses, and
have stood both, are asked to put their hands
in their pockets and repay to him bis $4,000
that, in the way of bis business, ho happened
to have in that Bank. Meanwhile ho plays

and in the other House. I believe that sort
of argument is absolutely extraneous, and that
this Bill should be considered solely on its
merits.
I am not approaching this Bill from the
sympathetic standpoint at all. I am basing
the vote I shall give in favour of this Bill
on the ground that I think this House is
bound to give such a vote in order to carry
out what was really the trust of those Governments that have preceded the present
Government. The right honourable gentleman
says that we have a trust, and that the moneys
that come into the treasury of the Dominion
of Canada must be votd by us as a trust.
That s:tatcment applies equally to the argument that I propose to submt to the, House,
in this wav. The right honourable gentleman
saitl that tbis might b considered as a war
loss. I am perfectly in accord with that
statement. It might bo con-icIered as a war
1
ioss. or thi- reason, if no other. that the
then Acting Minister of Finance before whom
the state of this bank fir-t cnmc, Sir Tiomas
Whîite. -aid frankly that he woulid not tlink
of t aking any decided action. ic s. f tr as the
Hoie Binrk was concernied, ditrin- the, course
of the war. for fear of its effect on thc
country.
So far as that statement is concterned, and
tbe position taken by Sir Thomas White, I
an not saying whether it is right or wrong.
Sir Thomas White may have been tioroughly
convinced that if he took such a step it would
litre been absoltutelyv wrong: and I leave it
at that. But this I do say, that if he took
that position he impliedly said that, so far
as hie was concerned, and the Department of
Finance, if he haid looked into the affairs of
the Home Bank he would have had to do
something drastie about it. I think that that
deduction cannot be gainsaid, and that it is
as logical as any deduction can be. Franklyv
he took that position, and the Home Bank
went on.
The rigbt honourable gentleman asked, what
is a bank? First, a bank bas a charter granted
b'y the Government; a bank has certain safeguards put upon it by the Government, for
one reason, and one only, to protect the
depositors and those having dealings with that
Bank. There, I say. the trust comes in, and
I say most decidedly that a trust existed in
the Department of Finance, headed by Sir
Thomas White at that time, and that if he
had actively exercised the trust that he should
have exercised, he would have said to those
people who knew that certain things were
going on concerning the Bank, that so far as
the Government was concerned h felt it his
bounden duty to look into those things
Hnt. Mr. PARDEE.

Remember, I am not finding fault with Sir
Thomas White on the stand that he took at
that time.
Then, we come down to the succeedinag
Government, opposite in politics, but the same
state of affairs was brought to the notice of
the then Minister of Finance and the then
Government.
People were being alarmed;
depositors were undoubtedly becoming nervous;
shareholders were frightened. They made the
representations over again; but for sorne
reason, I know not what, no more notice was
taken of tbose representations than had been
taken of the matters that hiad been put
before the preceding Government. The Bank
drifted on; the crash came.
Does anybody want to '-li me that, in
those circumstances, and with the succeeding
Governments seized of those facts, there
was not a trust in whatever Ocverament was
in power, to see that, so far as they were
humanIy able, the affairs of that bank should
he looked into, and that those people should
ho saved if it was at all pcsiblo to s vo thcm?
The claim ombodied in ibis Bill i- as near a
legal claim as; authing can be without being
such, adi I know it is not; but if ever there
was a strong mori il rlim presented to the
Parliament of this country, the Home Bank
case is the strongo-t moral clim :bat could
possibly come.
1v right honourable friend paints the
picture of a millionaire who plays golf and
rides in bis automobile; but I want to say
that the majority of people who were decosiiors in the Home Bank are in very humble
circumstances. and not people who play golf
and drive automobiles. They are people who
have saved their little all by dint of the
hardest possible work, and who deposited in
that Bank their savings with a sure and certain hope that they would be properly prctected, a.nd that they would get their money
when the most need came to them, in their
later years. Those are the people who are
vastly affected by this Bill.
The right honourable gentleman speaks of
200,000 people, and says this is not a national
caiamitv; but I say that very few calamities,
national or otherwise, ever have overtaken
a small country like Canada, or even much
larger countries, that have affected 200,000
peole. I again say, with all the might that
is in me, that if ever 'there was a moral case
in which people should have made up to them
the losses they have incurred, this is the case,
by reason of the circumstances by which it
was surrounded.
The honourable gentleman says, "Ah, but
look at the others who have suffered!" True,

JUNE 17, 1925

there were others, hundreds of others, who
suifered during the Gre.at War.
But in Sa
far as this country lias been able, she lias
made up to those people, in pension and dependent allowances and otherwise, and hma
done everything humaly possible to put tliem
back into V1he
position in which they previously
were.
The honourable gentleman sa.ys the farmers
produced, and produced, and produced. True,
they did. And they sold, and during the war
they soId at the largest prices that were ever
got in the history of this or an-y other country,
and during those years they made more money
than they had ever made in their lives, before.
lt is true that they produced during the Iast
year of the war and thiat prices dropped; but
even if the farmer did lose on the price of lis
product during the last year of the war, unlike the depositors of the Home Bank, lie bad

I have listened ta the speeches of honourable gentlemen who have spoken in favour of
tlie Bill. They have made a strong case:
Tliey say, as: the lionourable gentleman who
lias ju6t taken bis seat (Hon. Mr. Pardee) bas
said, that if we do not pass this Bill the poor
labourer and the poor washerwoman and
other people of that class will suifer a great
injustice. I do not believe there is a member
of this bonourable body wbo would not 'be

his capital left.
H1e 'had lis farm, and lie
could go on producing.
I take sharp issue
with the statement of the honourable gentleman thât because prices have dropped farmers
are practically in a state of penury.
The
farmers have flot done badly. They have had
a hard row to boe, but, witb thbe spirit and
the brawn of the sons of this Domninion, they
will pull through.
Tliey do flot need mucli
sympatliy.
But, for the poor washerwoman
and the po-or labourer, and tliat cl-as-s of mýen
and women wlio deposited their ail in the
Home Bank, I do say there is the strongest
moral elaim possible upon tlie Parliament of
this icountry to, vote ta them the $5,500,000
requested in this Bill.
Hon. J. D. REID: Honourable gentlemen,
I wish to say a few words on this Bill before

billions of debt

I cast my vote. I believe tliis is one of tlie
most important Bills tliat ever came before
Par.liment, and I believe tliat every mem-ber
of this House has given it very serious consideration.
I regret that the Bull lias been
lef t until two or three days before the close
of the Session. It could very well liave been
brouglit down early in tlie Session wlien this
body would have lied an opportunity of
placing it before a Committee and ge'tting at
the facts connected witli it s0 tliat we could
vote intelligently upon it.
I believe, honourable gentlemen, tliat, every
lionourable member of tliis body wants to do
what is riglit. We do n.ot want to, do
an injustice ta tliose wlio haod money
deposited, in the Home Bank, neither do we

On the other
band, other honourable gentlemen have spoken

of the great injustice which wil'l be clone ta the
8,000,000 people in this country if this Bill
is passed, and have pointed out tihat a large

additional amount will be added ta the indehtedness of the country.

the

greater part of whicli was caused by the war.
Sa far as I am coacerned, if there is any
just dlaim that the people of this country
should pay the depositors of the Home Bank
or anybody else lasses incurred in connection
with the war, 1 believe that the people of
this country are wil-liag to settle such a dlaim
so long as they belfeve it is right and just and
fair.
By thbis Bill wc are asked ta vote $5,450,000,
from wbicb every depositor is ta get 35 per
cent of bis deposit in tbe Home Bank.
While

I believe that if the Bill had came before us
in time ta go ta a Committee. we might have

been able ta grant a compassionate allowance
of some kind, I arn not satisfied at this; moment
tbat we sbould pass a blanket bill ta give

35 per cent of bis deposits ta every ane of the
depositors. Let me cite a case ta show wby
I am not satigfied. A number of the directors
of this bank have been tried and convicted
of bringing tlie bank ta failure.
Some of
those directars may have had large deposits in
that banik. Sa far as 1 amn concerned, I would
nut un any terins agree to give to any of tlie
directors 35 per cent of any amount whicb
tliey bad ut their credit at the time ao«the
failure.
Then, again, it lias been stated in the newspapers that the cause of the failu-re of the
bank was the organization of several large
companies by certain of the directors. Are we
going ta pay ta those companies 35 per cent
of their deposits, and in this way indireotly
pay the money ta the directors who brouglit
about the failure?
If I amn ta believe the
statements tliat I have heard, the greater part
of the deposits in the bank were deposits of
those wlio were really to blame for the disaster.

JUNE 17, 1925
If my amendaient is flot in order, foliowing the amend'ment of my honourable friend,
I would ask the honourable gentleman if lie
wouid consider withdrawing bis amendaient
in order that the one I propose may be
voted upon. I appeal to him to give the members of this honourabie body an opportunity
to examine into the facts, so that we may
.iudge. After we have had the information
before us, he can have the saine opportunity
to introduce again a resolution sucli as that
which. he has moved. I knaw that there is
not in this House any honourable member
who would go further than my honourable
friend who has moved the six month's hoist,
in order to do justice ta any persan, whether
rich ai' poor.
The honourable merober
wants to do what is riglit and fair. But, as I
have stated, if lis motion were to carry it
miglit have the effeet of doing an injustice.
Theref ore, Mr. Speaker, I beg to move my
amendnent, seconded by Hon. Mr. White
(Pembroke). I do not wish to interfere with
any other motion that is before the House,
but if His Honour the Speaker cannot see
bis way clear ta rule that my amendment is
in order, I ask that the honourable member
from Aima (Hon. Mr. Poster) consider favaurably my suggestion that the House lie given
an oppartun'ity to examine further into this
matter.
Hon. Mr. MACDONNELL: May I suggest that the list called for in that amendment ta the amendment should contain two
things: one, the vocation in life of the individual; and the other, his address.
Hon. Mr. REID: I may answer the hionourable member in this way. The amendnient provides for aur requesting a list of
sbareha!ders, but when it is before Committee we can ask for ail the information that
the honourable gentleman suggests; and I believe we would obtain very mucli more. If
you can only see your way clear to vote for
the amendment I propose, I believe that as
ta individuals sucli as those described by the
honourable member framn Lambton (Hon.
Mr. Pardee) and by the ex-Minister of Labour (Hon. Mr. Robertson), and that class
of people, this Huse and Parliament and
the people of Canada will always be ready
to do them justice; but we are nat willing,
in my opinion, to vote 35 per cent ta depositors who have been directars with money
on deposit, and who wrecked, this bank, or
to other individuals who were behind it and
wrecked it, thougli not legally cauglit. Let
us have ail the information befare us. If it
turns out that it is necessary ta vote the
$5,000,000, every man will feel from the bat-

tom of bis heart that lie bas had an opportunity of examining the facts and learning
the situation, instead of being practîcally in
the position of giving approval to this Bill
like a ruliber stamp.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Surely my hionourable friend does flot serious'y believe that
there is money at the credit of the directors,
He knows very well that those directars have
a double liability, and they are being sued
for that double liability.
Hon. Mr. REID: Let me point out ta the
honourable leader of the Governinent that
this Bill says that we are ta diàstribute $5,000,000 among those who had money on deposit
on sucli a date. That is wbat it says, and
that is wbat can be done. These directors
wiIl get the 35 per cent, and it will help them
ta pay their double liability. Farmers who
may not have had any money on deposit,
but wbo had invested their littie savings in
shares, will have to meet the double liability,
but they will not get any of this money, liecause they did not have anything an deposit.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But the depositors who were directors will receive nothing
under this Bill.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The honourable
gentleman from Grenville (Hon. Mr. Reid)
bas asked whether what lie proposes as an
amenchnent ta the amendment is in order.
I mruet say I do not consider it is.
The
amendment moved by the honourable Senator from Aima (Hon. Mr. Poster) was an
amendment ta the main motion:
That the word "«now" be struck out and the followin. added: "This day six montbs."

The motion proposed by the honourabie
gentleman from Grenville is not an amendment ta that amendment.
Hon. Mr. REID: I am very sorry. In
view of the ruling of His Honour the Speaker
I make an appeal ta the hanourable member
from Aima that lie will give this honourabie
body an opportunity of voting an my amendmient, and having the praper evidence laid
before us, which will ena:ble us ta justify aur
vote , whetber for or against the Bill.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I would suggest ta the
honourable gentleman that lie insert in bis
motion, "That this BilI be not read for thirty
days," and then provide for ail the rest of
what lie proposes. That would make it an
amendment ta this motion ta adjourn. for
six months.
Hon. Mr. REID: I think that the etraiglit
way would be the best way ta do it.

SENATE

The facts are these. First of all, in 1916,
and subsequently in 1918, certain representations were made to the Minister of Finance
of the time in respect to the financial situation
of the Bank in question. How were those
representations made, and how were they met?
What was the action of the Minister? How
did he use his discretion under the circumstances? In 1916 a letter came from three
directors in the West, headed by the Hon.
Mr. Crerar, calling the attention of the
Minister of Finance to what was evidently,
the very serious position of the Home Bank
at the time. There is no doubt as to that.
What did the Minister do? Did he tarry?
Was he at all irresponsive, or was there
indecision or procrastination on his part? No.
He immediately called upon the officers of
the Bank, and the auditor named by the
shareholders of the Bank-those who guaranteed the depositors, and who were therefore
most interested in seeing that the depositors
were paid-to make a special report to him
immediately. He went beyond that: he saw
the lawyer of the Bank, Mr. Lash, in whom
he and a great many people, with every
reason, had confidence. What was the result
of all this? Let me take it from the report
of Judge McKeown, and then I will ask
whether in 1916 there is anything for which
you can reproach the Minister of Finance;
and, secondly, whether there was in him such
a war mentality as might be considered the
primarv cause of the damage now suffered by
the depositors.
This is what Mr. Justice McKeown said,
after all the correspondence had taken place
-the notification-given to the Minister, and
the letter sent by the Minister to Mr. Lash
and to the Auditor of the Bank:
Ail these communications were written and information supplied within four weeks from the tinte of the
receipt by the Minster of the complaint from the
western directors, which shows that no time was lost
oit his part in at effort to secure the necessary information. The correspondence shows that the Minister was
not convinced that, because the eastern and western
dircetors had settiled their difference, he should stay
his hand from a thorough and complete investigation
of the bank's affairs. But further correspondence carried on by Mr. Lash and Mr. Crerar, and personal in-

terviews with the two latter as well as with Mr. Haney,
and information furnisbed concerning the accountsmuch of it misleading and false-and promises of a
thorough investigation of the bank's affairs under the
direetion of Mr. Haney and Mr. Machaffie, and infoination

supplied

by both these gentlemen and the

M:nister's desire to prevent the collapse of any bank
in view of war conditions, resulted in his acquiescing
n the unanimous request of the whole board that no
nestigation should

be made.

No other report

fron

the auditor was asked for or received. It was represented to the Minister, in a letter signed by Mr.
Crerar 'bat a change in management had taken place
bh which lie expressed himself certain that the know-

ledge and information concerning the position of
afcairs desired by the western directors, and the changes
Hoin.

Mr. BEAUBIEN.

they wished when they sent their request to him,
could now be made without catling in outside assistance; that the situation had materially improved within
the past month, and that it was better to have the
inquiry proceed from within rather than from withoust.

Now, honourable gentlemen, the report
shows that -the Minister tried to get immediate
information, and that the got the information;
that trustworthy people who had lodged a
complaint in his hands came back to him
and withdrew that complaint; that amongst
them was the Hon. Mr. Crerar, a colleague
of the Minister of Finance in the Cabinet of
that time; a gentleman in whom the Minister
had every right to have confidence, on account
of his situation, his reputation-and, let me
go further, on account of his very interest.
Al that was backed by the information
given to him by Mr. Lash, the lawyer of the
Bank, a man whose reputation was above
suspicion. It was also backed by the report
made by the Auditor of the Bank, an auditor
not named by the directors but by the shareholders--by those who, in naming him, were
seeking protection for themselves.
With all this information in hand, with the
new management installed, with every director
perfectly satisfied, with his colleagues in the
Cabinet sitting alongside of him and assuring
him that whatever may have been his complaint before it was withdrawn. Then under
such conditions only did the Minister stay
his hand, but not before having used the
discretion given to him by section 56A of the
Bank Act, to which I shall refer.
I have read the evidence, and I nowhere
foundi that the Minister declared that in this
particular instance he had stayed his hand
on account of fear of failure of this Bank
during the war. True, ie question was put
to him in a general way: "Mr. Minister, would
you in any case have put a bank in liquidation
during the war?'
And the Minister said,
"No."
The question that comes home to me is,
how reasonable is it to tie that general answer
to a specific case? Yet the honourable gentlemen opposite come to us and say: "There is
your Minister; ho had a clear-cut duty to
perform; the evidence shows that ho has not
performed it; if he had performed his duty,
the depositors would have been protected;
and this is why they come with their claim;
the Minister represented the people, and therefore the people of Canada, by law, by equity,
are bound to indemnify them." I think my
honourable friends will search in vain the
record for any reason to connect the Minister's
specific action, or lack of action, with his
pretended war attitude which the honourable
leader has so skillfully used in his argument.

JUNE 17, 1925
In 1918 another demand came to the Minister
to investigate the Bank. This time it came
from Mr. Machaffie, and it was a very serious
notification to the Minister as to the state of
the Bank. Now, we might say that with this
double advice from outside, surely the Minister must act. But just wait and sec how
much weight the Minister was entitled to
give to the complaint received from Mr.
Machaffie, who had lodged these accusations
against the Bank:
Mr. Machaffile subsequently retracted all these statenents in a letter to the bank, admitting that his intormation was inaccurate and incomplete, and that his
nrst letter would have conveyed. a wrong impression
as to the condition of the bank and the conduct of its
affairs. Now the Minister was acquainted with the fact
of this withdrawal, and that the reason Mr. Machaffie
had retracted these statements was, that he might prorute a settlement of hie claim against the bank. If
the accuracy of the information concerning the bank's
affairs had depended upon Mr. Machaffie's representations, while perhaps it would be to strong to say that
no attention whatever should have been paid to him,
yet the fact remains that he had retraeted them under
crcumstances that would very materialily weaken them,
and would also present their author in a very unfavourable light. If it were a question between Mr. Machaffie
and the offic:als of the bank, backed in their statement by Mr. Lash, no one would expect otherwise
thon that Mr. Machaffie's statements would be ignored.
In response to the Minister's call for a report upon the
matters, there was submitted to him underdate of 29th
October, 1918, a lengthy statement signed by the president of the bank, in the form of a report unanimously
adopted by the board, instructing the president to forward a copy to Mr. Lash, and with a direction to
have the same forwarded te the Minister. The report
made reference to what was done in 1916, and the
enanges made aince that time in the management of
the bank, discussed the accounts which had given so
much trouble, and reported favourably on the Britibh
Columbia account, and the New Orleans account; it
dened that any dividenda had been paid out of
cepital, and asserted that the profits of the bank
actually earned had been sufficient to warrant the payment of the dividends; it set out the net profits for
the years 1917 and 1918, and controverted Mr.
Machaffie's statements about the shipbuilding enterpose, cn which he had commented unfavourably; it
assured the Minister that the position of the bank had
brer, steadily growing stronger, giving figures of its
growth comeprising the years 1917 and 1918, and at great
length purported to set out the improved position of
the institution. It was a report of such a character as
te set at rest the mind of anyone who believed it, and
appsrently was written with that end in view. UIpon
its receipt the Minister apparently was convinced that
there was no necessity for ordering any further inves1lgation.

Then, what was the situation after 1918?
In 1916 the people who brought the complaint
to him withdrew it; everybody is satisfied,
especially those who had a real reason to
look for protection because they had guaranteed the depositors. In 1918 there is a
complaint made by a man who evidently
wanted to blackmail the Bank; that is quite
evident, and the Minister knows it, and he
attaches very little importance to it, as any
honourable gentleman in his place would have
S-34

done. The reports are given to him; he is
satisfied with them.
What was the position of the Minister in
the face af Section 56A of the Bank Adt?
Section 56A of the Bank Act gives the Minister a discretion under such circumetances to
make such investigation as he deems fit. Now,
the only thing that remains is this: was that
discretion used rightly, prudently, and wisely?
The Minister had to choose between two
inspections, or reports, or investigations-one
from within and the other from without. The
only thing that is suggested in this whole
record-I wi'll not say it has been said-is
that the Minister should have -chosen an outside investigation rather than an inside investigation. Now that we can look back, we
must conclude that such woudd have been the
better course, and why? Because the Minister was shamefully deceived, because the
reporte were false, ibecause the people who
made them were ieriminals.
But, honourable
gentlemen, are you going to judge the Minister in the light of what we know toaday? I
say it is most unfair. It is unfair not only
to the Minister but to the people of Canada,
because if he is on trial the people of Canada are on trial, as what we are called upon
to do now is to pass judgment against the
people of Canada for over $5,000,000. But are
you going ta judge the Minister from your
knowledge of ipast history? Are you going
to mulet the peopile of Canada in a judgment
of over $5,000,000 because you have your
hindsight to guide you instead of having
purely and simply the, Minister's foresight
at the time? I say that is unfair.
The question for us to determine now ie
simply this-dand in this I join with the honourable the junior member for Ottawa, (Right
Hon. Sir George E. loster) with all my might
-whether, in exercising his discretion, the
Minister bound the country to this measure
of relief. Be careful when you determine
that. There is a man against whoee honesty
and uprightness not a whisper is heard; there
is a man whose inteligence and knowledge of
business nobody can deny. He is brought
face to face with a situation in which he has
to use the discretiion that is given him by the
law. He uses that disoretion to the best of
his ability, and to such good purpose that my
honourable friends on the other side have to
stand as witnesses and say, "Why, none of us
woudd have aoted otherwise." There is the
use the Minister made of hie discretion; and,
in the light of the circumstances at the time,
he used it wisely. 'Nobody that I know of
has the suiperhuman vision capable of seeing
thnough to a man's soul. The Minister used

the dis.retion that the law gave him and the

Are you going te pass a law saying that a
Minister using his discretion wisely, as far as
Gold has given him to sec right from wrong,
and as 'diligently as a clean conscience could
dictate, is going te bind the peopile down to
the payment of $5.000,000 or more? Discretion
is granted in different forms poetical.ly at
and in
every stage in every organization
every nation in the world. Make no mistake
about it, honourable gentlemen, the discretion
given by Section 56A is not limited, and,
unless the Minister should be grossly negligent of his duty the country cannot be bound
by his act.
But let me go one step further. What is

Le deems it his duty to oppose a measure
coming from a Government which has his
entire confidence; and when to this is added
the necessity of denying the appeal of
thousands of persons, among whom there are
friends and even relations, who have lest
their fortunes, all they had, in the Home
Bank, the feeling becomes not only disagreeable, but one of distress. I must confess that
it is such a position that I occupy to-night.
This Bill, I understand, stands on two
different grounds. We are told that it is
a measure which provides a compassionate
allowance; but ~it is also, and mainly, a
measure which, as presented in this House, is
based on the Committee's report which was
read by the honourable leader of the Government. I refer to page 519 of the Debates
of June 15th. I will cite merely the last
paragraph of the report:

McKeown, and the evidence therein referred te, estab1iish that the depositors of the Home Bank have a

at the outset the moral claim. It is not urged
that there is any legal claim. It is admitted
by everybody that there is no legal claim.
But it is urged that there is a moral claim,
and the BilI is based on that. The moral
claim is founded upon the evidence which
has been referred to and cited by the honourable member from Montarville (Hon. Mr.

Beaubien).
For my part, I am of opinion that there is
no moral claim. I think that the Minister of

Mr. BEAUBIEN.

JUNE 17, 1925
Now, I think we have to consider this question very seriously from the standpoint of
precedent, not only with regard to banks, but
also trust companies. Honourable gentlemen will remember that for years past pressure bas been brought to bear upon the
Government to introduce Government inspection into the affairs of the banks. Until last
year the Government refused, for fear that
it might involve the responsibility of the
Government in case of the failure of a bank;
and when at last, in 1924, the Government
gave in and consented to adopt a system of
Government inspection, it was with the understanding, in the House of Commons as weil
as in this House, that it should not involve
the responsibility of the Government, but was
given as an additional guarantee to the publie.
Now, if we acknowledge by the passing of
this Bill that because of the circumstances
stated in the report to which I have referred
the moral responsibility of the Government
is involved, surely the understanding to which
I have alluded, as to the effect of Government inspection, no longer stands, and in all
cases in which a bank becomes involved
this Bill will be used as a precedent in demanding that the depositors be indemnified.
Honourable members must not lose sight
of the fact that in 1914 this Parliament
adopted what is known as the Trust Companies Act. This Act was amended in 1920,
1921 and 1924. Under the original Act, and
under the amendments which were made from
year to year, what is the position? The
position is this, that every trust company
taking deposits from the publie, which may
be as large as the deposits taken by banks,
is not only under the control of the Finance
Minister, but also that of the Superintendent
of Insurance, who is required under the
statute to examine the books of each company every year, and make a report to the
Finance Minister as to its standing. If the
principle of moral responsibility may apply
in the case now before us, surely it will apply
more in all cases of trust companies which
may become involved, and the depositors in
those trust companies would be entitled to a
moral claim on the Government, and they
will be using this case as a precedent.
I did not have the pleasure of hearing both
the leaders of this honourable House, but I
have read both their addresses from beginning
to end, and I have noticed that, as usual, one
presented the Bill and the ather supported it,
with their usual respective' talent and ability.
I could not, however, escape noticing that the
honourable -leader of the Government must
have found that his case was rather weak,

531

when he based his argument on the fact that
the depositors may have been under the impression that the Government was responsible.
I am sure that no depositors are under such
impression, and that it was never necessary,
to get the public to realize that they could
look only to the bank to put up a special
notice for that purpose. The Bank Act may
be somewhat involved when one desires to
mater all its details, but it is universally
known that the Government is not responsible
-that the depositors have the responsibility
of the Bank only with such privileges as
may be covered by the Bank Act. Therefore I do not think that that argument can
weigh at all in support of the measure.
But the honourable leader of the opposition
(Hon. Sir James Lougheed) made a very
important statement. In the Senate Debates
of the 16th inst., at page 541, I find that he
said:
I say, furthermore, that from 1903, when this bank
was establrshed, until 1923, it was a festering sors.
What really surprised me was that the different banks
of the country, as weIi as ýpersons who were more or
less famiaiar with the unforrtunate state of affaire which
prevailed in that bank. did not insist upon the Government of the day, ne matter what Government it
was, intervening and thus saving the situation.

This argument would tend to show that the
public knew what was the condition of the
Bank, and therefore with their eyes wide open,
they took the responsibility of dealing with
that Bank. Surely this would go a long way
to dispel any moral responsibility on the part
of the Government under the circumstances.
On the same point I might refer to the fact
that this Bank was incorporated as a bank
in 1908. Its stock was traded in at that time
at 133-1/2. In 1913 the Home Bank took over
the assets of the International Bank, and the
stock was then traded in at 128. But when
I look to see what became of that stock on
the market I find that in 1915 the lowest price
during that year was 65 and the highest was
87; so that the stock had gone down 50 per
cent; and in 1917 it had gone further down,
to 59 at the lowest, and 65 at highest price.
Well, surely the public who were dealing with
the Bank are supposed to have known the
general condition of the Bank from the
quotation of its stock, the price at which it
was selling; and if they deposited large
sums of money, as we are told they did, in
response to the canvassing, which was very
cleverly done, they took the responsibility,
and I do not see how it tan involve the moral
responsibility of the Government. If this Bill were not based on the report
of the Special Committee, but were presented
merely as a compassionate measure, I for my
part would hesitate to refuse to inquire fully

sufferers as possible. But te my mmrd the

one or two arguments that hie put forward,
as well as those of the honourable member
from New Brunswick (Hon. Mr. Black). They
said that there werc many people who lost

think the honourable niemiber for Lambton

say that, taking the ten-year period frem

way, that owing te the very high prices they
received fromn 1917 to 1920 they acquircd sonie

Sc'-veral honourable gentlemen have argued,
with Pome for-ce. that depositors were aware

who placed their deposits in chartered banks

sorne justification for that,, at least in Ontario,
becau'.e some years ago we had a great many

second reading of the Bill, I think we ought
ta confine ouýr discussion to the principles of
the Bill itself.
I must candidIy confess that I have had
considerable hesitation at different times with
regard to the vote which I shall give. I have
been greatly irnpressed by Borne of the observations which have corne from, those opposed
ta the Bill. Perhaps, because I
it rnay lie said of my speech, asarn a Iawyer,

more or less discredit rnay lie put upon it by
some people calling it such. But a ls.wyer, if
lie lias strong legal convictions, is bound to
express thern, whether in this House or before
the courts, and even if it iqsa lawyer's speech
I do think that the point of view I arn about
ta lay before the House is wortliy of very
serious consideration by every member.
First of ahi, I want ta state briefly the
situation of the Home Bank on the one hand,
and of the Government on the other, when
the diselosures were rnade by Mr. Lash, Mr.
Grerar and others to the then Minister of
Finance. Sir Thomas White had'before him information which I think would have cornpelled
hirn ta take imnrediate action if it had not
been for the condition in which the country
was 'pisced at tbe tirne. By that I mean that in
ordinary tirnes, if information of this kind had
been laid before Sir Thomas White as Finance
Minister, it would have been lis manifest
duty ta interfere and do sarnething on behalf
of the depositors of the bank.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I think that is an
extremely important point, and I wouid like
rny honourable friend ta show us in the

because I did not see anything there.
Hon. Mr. BELGOURT: I saw a gret deal,
but I arn not going ta read ahI I saw, ini
support of that point I arn going ta content
myseif by referring ta page 521 of the Senate
Debates, where a quotation ie taken from
evidence submitted ta a Cornrittee in another
place. It reads as fol'lows:
On the 29th of February, a month after, Mr. Lash
writes to Mr. James Fisher as fdllows:
"Temore I consider the banks position, even
assuig that every Becount will ultimately lie colleeted in full, the more dotïbtiu1 I feel as ta the
possibility of its contimsing in business. The amounit
lock-ed Up indefinitely in four large accounits, is probably three times the paid-up capital, and more than half
the total deposits; and if anythig shoild take place
which would cause a consparatively amall percentage
of the depositors toa sk for their rnoney, I do flot see
how the bank would, without assistance from outside
enutinue witli open doors.
"I told Sir Thomas lihat my main object, since I
lesrned in outline what the liank's position was, lias
been to bring about a position, which, if the worst
bapponed, would result in liquidation with open doora.
This can only bie broug¶st a-bout by the assistance
of other banks, and I want delinite instructions from
the board as ta, how far I may go in this direction in

correctiness of bis position, that, after you, on behalf

that the Bank was crippled.

In the interim reiport :o.f the Royall Commission we find the following from Mr. Z. A.
Lash to ýMr. James Fdsher:
The more I consider the bank's position, even
Fssuming that every account will ultimately be collected in ful, the more doubtful I feel as to the
possibility of its continuing in business. The amount
lenked up indefinitely in four large accounts, is probably
three limes the paid-up capital, and more than half
the total deposits; and if anything should take place
whch would cause a comparatively small percentage of
the depositors to ask for their money, I do not see
how the bank would. without ,assistance from outside,

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No. I put the
onus on Sir Thomas White in this respect.
that he would not during the war close down
the Bank.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Excuse me one minute.
I asked a question, and t-he Leader of the
Government intervened and I have not got
an answer.
Hon Mr. BELCOURT: I insist upon going
on with my speech. The honourable gentleoman can ask questions of the other gentlemen.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I asked the Leader of
the Government whether the statement he
read was before or after Mr. Crerar wrote to
Sir Thomas that he had examined the British
Columbia accounts and those other big
accounts, and thought they could pull through.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is a month
before.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Thank you very much.
That is what I want.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The statement I
make, and I make it on the authority of the

JUNE 17, 1925
evidence, is that at the time the Minister of
Finance decided that he was flot going to
interfere with this Bank, hie was absolutely
weli1 aware of the conditions of the Bank,
because we have the eviden-ce of Mr. Lash,
whom he called in to advise, who tells us that
on that occasion lie told him exactly the position of the Home Bank.
Now I ask my honourable friend from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) if lie or any
other member of this House could possibly
for one moment entertain the opinion that it
was not the manifest duty of the Minister of
Finance to intervene.
Would he not have
intervened, had it not been for the war, the
other reason lie gave? To me that is patent.
It is in evidence, and no amount of shakîng
of heads or contradiction is going to, alt6r the
facts.
Hon. Mr. GORDOJN: Would the bonourable gentleman permit me to ask a question?
This letter which the honourable gentleman
rend is not to Sir Thomas White, but to, Mr.
Fisher.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The letter says
that lie to]d this te, Sir Thomnas White. 'Phat
is what the evidence shows. If honourable
gentlemen would only pay some attention,
and rend it with ordinary willingness to follow, they would understiand it.
I arn afraid I shali have to repent myseif.
I lad intended to take about ten minutes,
but the time bas been taken away from me.
I submit that under conditions ci that time
it was the manifest duty, under ordinary
circumstances, of the Minister of Finance to
have closed that Bank riglit then and
there,
and not to have allowed it to go on for
another hour; andl I have no hesitation in
believinig that that is exactly what Sir Thomas
White would have done lad it not been for
the eircumstance of the war.
He made a further statement, a.nd there is
no dispute about that, that during the war
hie would flot close any hank under any condition or circumstanceHon, W. B. ROSS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: -thnt lie held that
the national credit was n matter as to whidb.
no chances shbould be taken; and that the
closing of the Home Bank or any other bank
tvas of such a nature as to hurt the credit
of the country, and lie would not do nny,thing whicli miglit in any way imperil the
national credit. That was the attitude of Sir
Thomas White, and, I have no doubt, of the
Government which stood behind bim. Cali

cali it a legal dlaim, a moral dlaim, an equitable dlaim, or a compamionate dlaim-I here

case were a case, not between the subject an-i
the Crown, but between subject and subjeet,
there would be an absolute riglit to place
before the courts a dlaim. enforcible in the

Hon. Mr. GORDON: I dislike to, interrupt
my honourable friend, but I tlhink I sbould

Hon. Mr. GORDON : I arn just giving a

that the honourable gentleman was going on
wrong premises nîtogether. If the bonourable gentleman will be kind enougli to rend
itHon. Mr. BELCOURT: Oh, no, I do not

I say there is no question, notwitbstanding

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: 1 amn quoting
from Mr. Lash's own wocds. Now, what was
the consequence of the position created? We
have on the one hand the Minister cf Finance,
wlio, I repeat, knew exactly the situation of
ibis Bank at that moment. He was faced with
the evil of this Bank getting into more
trouble; le wvas faced witli the possibility cf
the Bank incurcing more liabilities and becoming more largely indehted te its depositors. I bave no dou'bt that he realized

I have described, in order that the national
credit might flot tDe injured.
I am n ot here to blame Sir Thomas White
for the position he took. I arn quite sure
that in whatever way he proceeded in order
to arrive at hais conclusion, he acted with the
for ail
grea test probity and consideration
parties concerned, especially for the State.
He may have made an error of judgment. 1
ar nfot going to say even that much. But 1
say that, for the purpose of preventing the
national credit from being hurt, Sir Thomas
White decided that he would let this Bank go
further into the bole, and that he would allow
its depositors to add furtber losses to those
they had already suifered.
Now, I say as a matter of law-and I say
it with great confidence-that if a condition
of that kind had arisen between subject and
subject, the doctrine of estoppel would amply
have supported the claim. He said, "AIl right,
you are going to suifer, but the State is going
te suifer more than you; meantime you have
to put up with your loss." I say that there
was in that an implied undertaking on the part
of the Government which bound the Government of that day and which bound the Governments which have existed since; and I say
that this Government is merely and only
implementing and carrying out that implied
indertaking of the then Mlinister of Finance
I repeat:
in proposing this compensatiun.
I believe there is no dlaim agiinst the Crown
enforcible at law, because I do flot think that
iinder the provisions of the Exehequer ýCourt
Act a dlaim of this kind cen be supported. and
I can flnd nowhere under the War Measures
Act a remedy for a case of that kind. It may
lie so--I believe it is-that there is no daim
that could bc legally made and enforced as
against the Government by the depositors of
this Bank; but I repeat that if it were a
matter hetween subject and subjeet there is
absolutely ne dou'bit that there would be a
good, substantial and legal claitu in the courts
on the part of the losers.
I do flot think I need labour the argument.
I hope I have made myself clear and thoroughly understood. I hope it is understood,
for instance, that I arn not blaming Sir
Thomas White for the action which he took.
He exercized bis judgment under very difficult,
very trying conditions, at a time when he
had resting upon bis shoulders, a greater responsibility than that of almost any other
man in Canada. He was, under the law and
the con,,titutional practice, the mari wbo was
to decide this question. The whole responsibility of it reste-cd upon him, and I would
not think it proper at this time to blame Sir

JUNE 17, 1925
Thomas White for comning to the conclusion
that he reached. But I say that he came to
that conclusion with the determination that
the Home Bank depositors should nlot seek
for any publie proeeeding for the closing of
the, Bank, but slhould be content to put up
with the losses which hie at that time knew
were absolutely inevitable if the Bank
went on.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Well, would the honouraible gentleman indicate now the words on
which lie rests that statement?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What statement?
Hon. Mr. ROSS: The statement the honourable gentleman lias just made.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I have made
several. I do not know which one the honourable gentleman means.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: Tlie lionourable gentleman has just flnished one statement now.
There were not two at one time. It is the
very last statement lie made, that Sir Tliomas
Wlite-Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That Sir Thomas
White did what?
Hon. Mr. ROSS: That Sir Thomas White
was asking the depositors of the Home Bank
to take a loss, for tlie publie benefit.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: I did not say lie
a.sked tliem.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: You say it is împlied.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: Now, I ask, on what words
do you rest that implication?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not rest it on
any words or any evidencc at ail.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: On your own imagination,
I think.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I rest it on the
conditions, as a natural, logical, deduction of
what took place. I do not rest it on evidence.
Hot. Mr. ROSS: No. Ail riglit. That is
what 1 thouglit.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But 1 cannot
understand the object of these rather savage
interruptions.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: They are not savage at
ail. The lionourable gentleman is making
chargWs, in effect, against Sir Thomas White.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: I amrnft making
any charges at ail.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: I beg the honourable
gentleman's pardon. They are charges, and

3.

serious charges, and I want to know whether
lie resta them. on evidence or only on his own
imagination.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I repeat, I have
not made the sliglitest charge against Sir
Thomas White. I have distinctly stated that
I did nlot propose -to make any.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: You make charges when
you make implications against him.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: Oh, nonsense I
Hon. Mr. ROSS: In one breatli the lionourable gentleman states that Sir Tliomas White
did, not do anytliing; in anotlier breath lie
says that Sir Thomas Wliite is to blame for
the whole tliing.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Perhaps for my
honourable friend's satisfaction I should repeat
exactly wliat I said a few minutee ago. I
do not intend at this time, and I do net think
anybody sliould intend, to pass judgment on
Sir Thomas White for exercising bis discretion
as lie did at the time this thing took place.
I stated very distinctly that I was perfectly
sure tliat, whatever was the final argument or
motive whicli induced Sir Thomas White,
lis decision was inspired by the strictest
bonesty and strictest probity, as well as by
the ýgreat interest which lie as a Canadian and
as a Minister of the Crown felt in the public
welfare. What more coudd I say? A charge
in that? Any charge against anyhody in
that? I think my honourable friend ouglit
to apologize for using that 'language to me.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: He lias absolutely
no justification of any kind for using itnone wliatever.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: What is that? Well, wait
until your speech is reported and you will
see that you did make an implication.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I shaîl nnt see it,
berause it will not lie tlere.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: Tlien do flot sce the
report. If the report.er gets it ahl down we shahl
have it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The position is to
me quite clear--unquestionable. By reason of
that exercise of discretion on the part of the
Minister of Finance the Home Banik depositors
have suffered a very great loss, which tliey
would not have suffered had hie taken action
at the time. For not choosing to take action,
I arn not blaming him in the sliglitest; but
that does not affect the question. The fact is
that by reason of his attitude, good or bad-

538

SENATE

and I say nothing as to that-these people
have s.uffered a loss which they would not
have suffered othenvise; and I say that there
was in his conduct an implication, or a promise, or undertaking, that the loss which they
might suffer would be looked after in the
future.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: There it is. Excuse me one
minute. An implication. then, is drawn from
his conduct. It is not drawn from any facts
at ail.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I have done my
best to explain to my honourable friend, but
it is quite evident that he is not willing to be
fair.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: I would like to know what
you are talking about, that is alil.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, I have listened with considerable
interest to the debate as it has been carried
on. and I wonder if I cannot at this moment
state what I believe to be the mean opinion
of the Senate. When I say "the mean opinion,"
this implies that there may be extremes, but
the mean opinion, I should think, would be
held by two-thirds of the members of the
Senate. If I am wrong. I shall be told so. I
have a suggestion to make. but before making
it I want to state what I believe to be the
mean opinion of the Senate. It is that the
measure presented to the Senate should cover
what may bc called. or what we understand
by the expression, the savings accounts. I do
not qualify the savings accounts by mentioning any figure, inasmuch as a savings
account. whether of $500 or $5.000, may represent the whole savings of a family, and it
is therefore rither difficult for me to draw
a line to distinguish between the person who
has a srnall amount to his credit and another
person who may have deposited what appears
to be a large amount. but may be ail he has.
Take, for instance, the case of a widow who
received from an insurance company $3.000,
or $4,000, or $5.000. She has her little ones
about her. Surely no one will say that
he is not entitled to the full advantage of
the mcaure which is now before us. Weil,
I think that the mean opinion of the Senate
is that if such accounts were covered bv the
Bill it would carry without great difficuity.
Here is the suggestion I have to make.
According to the practice of the Senate, and
parliamentary practice, I have the right to
bind myself and the Senate by my declaration.
I would ask that we take the second reading
of this Bill with the clear understanding that
we do not commit ourselves to the principle;
Hon.

Mr. BELCOURT.

tiat

we go into Comnittee. and that in Committee we examine proposais, such as the
sugge-tion that under this Act no person who
was a trader or had an account or had a
credit from the Bank shall participate in this
division. I am stating crudely. Care would
be neces-arr in limiting the distribution to
persons having savings accounts, for I am not
sure but that in some branches ail the accounts
were not savings accounts, even those not so
named.
People may bave come to such
branches and deposited their money without
it being understood that there was a savings
department.
Therefore we would have to
take precautions in that respect. But the idea
would bc to eliminate from the benefits of this
Bill directors, for instance; though, if we
postponed the Committee stage for a day
or two, I believe I would have a clear statement indicating that the directors. who are
sued for hundreds of thousands of dollars,
cannot participate in this division.
Certain objections have been rai-ed. and
hypothetical cases given. which are to my
mind futile. But that makes no difference,
because when we bave the cloth before us
we can eut it as we please, and we can, if
we desire, make an amendment which will
restrict the distribution of the monev to the
persons whom everyone has in mind and
wishes to protect. I am quite sure that with
the legal talent we have in this Chamber it
will not take long to devise an amendment
which will satisfy ail, as representing the
mean opinion of the Senate.
Perhalps tihere will be those who will say,
"I wil not under any conditions agree to the
establishment of a precedent." On that score
we shail vote, and the miajority will decide.
It seems to .me that we can reach a decision
without accopting the amendment, providing
for an inquiry which would mean procrastination and mako it necessary to await the final
report of the liquidator, which may not come
for ten years. I have here the statement as
to the Bank of Vancouver, a sma'l bank whireh
failed in 1914, and the liquidation is not yet
complete or closed. You have the statement
that the liquidation cannot produce more than
5 per cent, or at the outside 10 per cent, and
we ail know that. We might wait a year and
not be further advanced with regard to the
liquidation. That is ,the reason why I believe
that. by the process I suggest, if we are realdy
sincere in the desire ta come to the rescue of
poor people who have realy suffered by the
closing of this institution. we can do so.
Honourable gentlemen who concur in this
suggestion will not be bound by the second
readling, and if, ei-ther on the report of the

JUNE 17, 1925
Committee, or on the third reading, they are
not satisfied, they can vote against the*Bill
altogether.
Hon. IMr. REID: The remarke of the honourable leader of the 'Government are direoted,
of course, to the amendment that I moved.
I do not agree with the position that he takes,
and my reason ils this. In the amendment
that I moveid the point I wished to emiphasize
was that the BiH had come to us within tiwo
or ithree days of the olosing of the Session. I
stated that it was one of the most important
Bille that had ever come before this House.
I claimed that we ought to have ail the information necessary in order to decide whether or not we shoulld pay, and, if seo, what
anount. The honourable leader asks us to
go into Committee immediately and decide
that we are going to pay a certain amount.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, I am not
asking that: my honourable friend is mistaken. I simply ask tha't we take the second
reading stage and fix the Committee stage for
the day after to-morrow, and if during these
48 hours we can evolve an amendment that
wild satisfy my honourable friendHon. Mr. REID: We have had no information regarding the expenditure of this amount.
Not .the lightest information has the Covernment given to this Hfouse, in order that we
may decide what position to take on this Bill.
The honouraible gentdeman thinks that between now and Saturday night, when prorogation is expected, he can get alq the necessary
information and satisfy us all, so that we may
honestly vote as we should?
,
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: IMy honourable
friend puts a question? I will undertake to
give that necessary information to my honourable friend within 48 hours. Il I fail, then
there will remain this alternative-either to
go on with the Session or to postpone the
,Hon. ,Mr. REID: May I say to the honourable ileader of the Government that the
depositors must wait until thhe final report of
the liquidator as to the balance they are to
get.
Hon. Mr. DANDUIRAND:
They would
wait five or ten years.
Hon. Mr. REID: Five years?
Five or ten
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
years.
Hon. Mr. REID: I- will take thie position.
If the honourable leader of the Government
will agree to my proposition and bring this
Bilil down next Session, and let the liquidator

539

come and show what amount he has paid and
what are the prospects regarding the balance,
then we can decide the amount we ought te
pay and .can put the Bill into proper form at
that time. That is what I think is fair.
Hon. iMr. DANDURAND: No, no.
Hon. Mr. REID: It certainly is.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I want to draw
my honourable friends attention to this
situation, that there are tens of thousands of
poor people who are awaitting that money, and
no one will look after them during the twelve
months that are yet to run.
Hon. Mr. REID: Twelve months? Wihy, I
think this House wiil meet within six months.
Instead of godng to the poor people, twothirde of this amount that is being voted
wouild go to people who do not need to wait,
because they have plenty of means. But, besides thaîtHon. Mr. DANDURAND: But it is those
people that we wiil eut off if we can succeed
in drafting a satisfactory amendment.
Hon. Mr. REID: Let me say to honourable
members of this House, I would be very
sorry indeed if poor people must suffer for
a few months longer, but, in justice to the
people of this country, and in view of the
amount to be voted, I say that we ought to
have an opportunity of deciding intelligently.
Why, if we pass this Bill in the manner
suggested by the honourable leader of the
Government, the amount 'being fixed, we have
to adopt it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No.
Hon. Mr. REID: It is in the Bill at the
present time. Of course, every honourable
member is free to do as he likes, but the
position I take is this. I stated this afternoon,
and I repeat now, that I am in favour of
compensation being given to any poor people,
such as those who have been mentioned by
the honourable leader of the Government and
the honourable member from Lambton (Hon.
Mr. Pardee). If there are any poor washerwomen or labourers who are suffering, I will
raise both hands in favour of assisting them,
and I believe every other member of this
House will do the same. But I object to
voting money to directors, to companies, and
to people of independent means. I object to
rushing through a BilIl before we have had
time to examine it. I do not think that is
fair. Let the House decide, by voting on
my amendment, whether it desires to have
al' the necessary information before it. With
that information before us, let us do what is

540

SENATE

ri---lit and just. I will vote for compensation
to those who are in need of it, but 1 will nlot
vote for compensation to a large numaber of
persons to whorn this Bill would give it. I
plead with the honourable leader
of the
Governiment to put us in such a positionL that
we may vote intelligeotly,
and I do nlot
believe that anyone will suifer even if we
hav e to delay the Bill for two months. Surely
that is flot unjust. 1 go further, and say that
if this Blouse will accept mny amendmnent we

will do justice to those who sbould be comnpensated, or those wbo are in need. Those
people will corne in, next Session for at least
haif the amount, and I believe we will flot
ooly do justice to tbose who are entitled to
fi.
but we wi]l save the people of this
ccuntrv millions of dollars by flot rushing
tbrough a Bill of this kind that bas beefl
impo-ed upon us within 48 or 72 hours of
pi orogatiofi.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable
gentlemeni, there appears to bie somle MISunderstanding between my honourable friend
the leader of the Goveromnent and tbe hionourable member frorn Greniville. As 1 recal
tbe amendment, it is to the effeet that this
matter sbould stand in abeyance until the
hiquidator of the Home Bank makes a final
report, and has concluded bis work. It would
therefore obviously be entirely impossible for
Parhiament to give any furtber coosideration
to this matter for years, at least.
It w'is pointed out here on Monday night,
I think, that tbe Bank of Upper Canada,
wbich wvas liquidated in 1867, was nlot finally
wound up until 1882. My honourable friend
the leader of the Government bas pointed
out that the Bank of Vancouver, failing in
1914, is not yet wound up. Therefore if we
adopt tbe arnendment now before the Blouse
it means that tbe Home Bank depositors
could nlot expeet to get any further relief for
a period of probably ten years. I sincerely
hope that my bonourable friend who moved
tbis amendmnent will consent to the suggestion of the leader of the Government and Jet
this Bill go to tbe Committee stage, and be
amended as far as tbat cala be done there.
,If we can agree, well and gond; if not, there
will be time enougb to divide the Blouse.
If mv bonourable friend insists on dividing
tbe Blouse at tbis time on: the question
wbether the Home Bank depositors of every
variety are to be deprived of any relief for
a period anywbere from five to ten years,
then I must certainly oppose bis amendrnent.
Hon. Mr. REID: My amendment was
never intended to deprive depositors of relief for five or ten years. I arn ready now,
Hon.

'Mr. REID,

if tbere is any need of it, to nanie the middle
of ndxt Session as tbe time when it will be
brougbt down. Tbe intention of tbe amendment is to Jet tbe liquidator give us bis report, wbicb bie can do hy tbe beginning of
,next Session, and on tbe basis of that report
I arn prepared tbat tbe Bill sbould corne in
here, and we will discuss it on tbose lines,
and I will not ask for any further extension.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My bonourable
friend's amendment, as it reads in bis own
bandwriting-, is as follow8:
That furtiier consideration of this Bill be postponad
until the hiqu:dator of the Home Banik bas made his
final report showing the total losses made by the
dleposulors after the proceeds reahlized fromt the assets
have been dustributed; and further, that a full hjat of
depositors, showiîîg
thse amouat of losses of eash
rlepositor, bas been prepared and submUted to Parilamerit.

INow, honourable gentlemen, 1 submit that
tbat is nt capable of any other interpretatien than tbat tbe Home Bank depositors
must wait until the assets of tbe bank bave
been disposed of and distributed to tbe depositors.
Hon. Mr. REID: If tbe Blouse places tbat

That does flot belp

Hon. Mr. REID: I arn willing to amend
ýtbat in any way wben we cana get tbe inforrnation before this Blouse on wbicb we
can decide it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Tben tbat brings
us to this point, tbat tbis amenidment would
be exactly equivalent to the amendment of
the honourable member frorn Alma, wbicb
was witbdrawn this afternoon: it would bave
.exactly tbe sanie eifect as a six rnontbs'
hoist. I feel that tbat ougbt nlot te be entertained at this time, for I arn informed by
tbe Cbairînan of tbe Depositors' Relief Association tbat over 90 per cent of all tbe de,positors, nurnbering over 60,000, bad deposits
of less tban $5,000. So tbat tbe large amounts
that have been referred to are certainly very
rare, and tbis Blouse cana go into Committee,
and so revise the sections of tbis Bill as to
provide against tbe payment of any unnecessary or unfair amounts to anybody. But we
should proceed, and flot delay in bringing
reasonable relief to tbose wbo are suifering
and have suifered for two years as tbe result
of tbe failure of tbis Bank.
May I read just one letter reueived tbis
mornineg, to indicate tbe clas.s of case to
wbicb I referredl? Tbe date is yesterday.

JIJNE 17, 1925
After I spoke in the House on Monday night
this letter was written:
Being a loser of my living in the way of iny deposit.
given me by My mother and brother, botb beimg dead.
wbo gave me this money for my keep, I was tripped
m-hen I was just etarting to school i my fiftb year, andI
suffered with grat suffering for 16 yers, and now arn
a cripple, wbe bas had te make my living, having hip
disease.
Since losing my money in thse Home Bank
I have tried tailoring for a living, but have had to
give it up. I eaw ini the morning's Globe that you
would be glad to compensate smail depositors in full
w~hen the Home Bank failed. My depeait-

-whieh wae ýlef t by lier mother and brother-was $2,846.71 on August lTth. 0f course 1 received
the 25 per cent, but I am a girl witbout a friand or
nhoney, and may bave a long life before me, and a
cold world for charity, and 1 amn asking you if you will
kindly consider eny condition and adqow me my deposit
in full, as it is the only hope tha± 1 bave for a living.
Tharking you, 1 am, etc.

Now, honourable gentlemen, there is the
class of case te, which I referred, in whith
relief should flot be postponed. I arn perfectly willing to adopt the suggestion of the
leader of the Gevernment, and go into Cemmittee, and amend the details of this Bill
in such a way that nobody will reap undue
henefit, but that those who need the relief,
and are entitled te it, will receive it promptly.
1 hope that the suggestion of the bonourahie
leader of the Goverument in this connection
vill prevail.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE FOSTER:
I would like te ask my honourable friend if, in
that proposition hie bas made, lie could place
before this Committee, or a special Committee, if necessary, within 48 hours or other
reasonable time, a list of those who are
creditors of that Bank?
Hon. Mr. DANDUTRAND: As depositcTs.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE FOSTER:
As depositors, which would include everyone
who had a 'balance te his-credit in tihat bank.
If he is able te do that, some difficulties in
my mind would be removed. What my lionourable friend fromn Grenville is after, as
stated now, is that lie dees net wish te go te
,lhe limit of the absolute finish of the inquest
by the liquidator into the Bank's assets, which
might very well take eight or ten years. What
he wants is this very information which My
honourable friend's proposition seems te imrlement. If it dees fully implement it, and
that information is in our bandis within 48
heurs, or a reasonable time, I think we might
very serieusly consider whether we could net
corne together on that point.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I understand that
within 48 heurs the leader will produce a list
of the 60,000 depositors of the bank; but if
that list were had, of what use would it be te

541

any person? That is one question. The other
is this: with the list of depositors, will yen
give separately the creditors who have current accounts, as well as those who have deposits in the savings branchf
Hon. Mr. DANDTJRAND: The only thing
I will undertake will be thi8-Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Pardon
me; will my bonourable friend undertake
te hring Mr. Clarkson, the liquidater, here?
Týhat is just
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
what i was geing te say. The enly thing I
will undertake will he this, te ask the Clerk
of the House, if my proposition is agreeable,
te send a wire te Mr. Clarkson te be bere in
the morning.
We are net binding ourselves te the principle
of the Bill. We will know from Mr. Clarkson wbat be can give us. We will bear him
hefore a Cemmittee of this Bouse in one
of our large cemmittee reems, and there
learn the situation at first band.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: Now that the rules
of the Bouse are suspended, I take it you
could send this Bill now te the Committee
of the Whole without a second reading at
ail.
I do net beHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
lieve se. It dees net matter if we follow
the ordinary practice, and give the Bill a
second reading.- We deciare that we do net
bind ourselves te the principle of the Bill.
It is simply te reach the Committee later.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-.STAUNTON:
The
hionourable gentlemnan says that hie will have
that information te-merrew. Now, from the
opinion of the Bouse as bie has learned it
in this discussion, could hie net in the meantime prepare an amendment which hie could
suggest te tihe Bouse when bie brings that information down? If we get only the information, we, will have a wrangle here for
another týwo or tliree days; but if bie drafts
an amendment te cever the condition wbich
he thinks would be acceptable te the Bouse,
and brings that amendment down with the
information te-merrew or the next, dayHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I would draw
the attention of my honourablý friend te
the fact that that is net the proper procedýure
te follow. I would net tbink of suggesting an
amendment hefore hearing Mr. Clarkscm.
At a certain moment I will ask for a cernmittee of eight or ten of the members of this
Chamber te meet Mr. ClarksGn, and when
we bave heard bim we will see how far we
sbould go in framing an amendment.

JIJNE 17, 1925
and it is one that I intend to dissent from
as far as I can.
Hon. Mr. CURRY: I think that the honourable memiber fircm Grenville made it quite
plain that h6.s am-endiment would read that
this matter m.uet be deait with at the next'
Session of Parliament. I do flot thînk that
any depoéstor will ha hoimqed in that time.
The depositors have already liad 25~ per cent
of the-ir deposits, and those deposits were no0
doubt put in the bank, with the expeetation
that they would be tihere a long time. Even
in the latter which the honourable menvber
from Welland (Hon. Mr. Robertson) ham
read, the depositor admits th-at -- has rehe
ceivad 25 par cent. Now, 25 per cent of
$2,800 is a good deal more money than she
will spend before the next Sitting of Parliament, an that she and othars like lier will
flot suifer in any way by waiting until Parliament sits again, and the Bill can ha dea!t
with on its merits.
Some Hon. MEMBERS: Question, questiron.
Hon. Mr. M-cLENNAN: I would like to
moya an amendment to the ameoýdment,
namnely:
That the amendment be altered by atrikîng ont the
iollowing words: 'has made his final report showing
tl'e total losses made by the depositors after the procecds realized.

from the assets," and substituting there-

for the words: "a report ahowing the names of depositors, their status, and the amounit of thoir deposits,
aid such further information as may be required."

If that can be done within 48 hours, or
immedîateldy, it wiLl give the information
which the House requires. If it cannot ba
done whiJe the House is sitting, the mateter
will have to stand over tilil next Session,
whioh wouild be undesiraible.
Hon. M-\r. DANDURAND: I wouild ask the
honourable the Speaker to read the amendment of the honourable gentleman from
Grenville (Hon. Mr. Raid), and then the
sub-amendment in full, becausa I believe the
sub-amendment takes ini part of the amendment.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: As I understand
it, the amendmnent of the honourable Senator
from Grenville is:
That al the words after the word "'be" in the main
motion be struck out, and the followimg substituted
therefor:
-lot now further considered, but be posponed until the
liqoidator of the Home Bansk ka macle hie final report
ahowing the total basses made by the depoultors after
tIse proceeda realized f rom the assete have been distri.buted among the depositors, and, further, that a
fuîll list of depositors, showing amounts of losses of
earIs depositor, has been prepared and submitted ta
Parliament.

543

The honourable Sanator from Cape Breton
(Hon. Mr. MeLennan) moved in amandment
to, the amendment:
That the B:11 he not oow further oonsidered, but be
postsponedi until the liquidator of the Home Bank has
smde a report ah-iwing the names of depositors, their
status, and thse amounts of their deposita, and such
further information as may be required.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: By -whom?
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: By this House.
Ha is going to make a report to this House.
Hon. Mr'. DANDURAND: 1 simioly draw
attention to the fact that ail these amendments are of no avaiu, and, in my judgment,
should be rejected, because we ivil! reach tise
sae end by sending this Bill into Committee
on Friday, and a.waiting- the interview that
we wiIl have with Mr. Clarkson.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Will you
undertake to get Mr. Clarkson?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Doas the
honourable gentleman say that if these amend.
ments are defaated and the Bill goes to, the
Committea it is on the understanding that wa
are not committed to the principle?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable gentlemen, it saems to me that there should ha no
undue haste in taking a vote on this question.
The honourable the Leader has stated very
clearly and definitaly that hae
asks nobody
to commit himself on the principle of this
Bill. It is not neeessary to take a vote now
for that purposa. Ail that ha asks is that this
Bill ha sent to Committee in order that we
may get the information we require ta
enable us vota intelligently on this question.
That is ail. Why shou'id it ha necessary at
this particular moment to taka a vote on the
main question? The honourable gentleman
has agraed, and bas made it perfectly plain,
that. if we vote for the second reading of the
Bill, and sand it to Committea, nobody is
voting on the principle.
For my own part, I desire information,
and while I would vote for the Bill as it
stands, rather than rejeet it, there are some
very important amendments whieh I would
lika to sae made ta it and which I think
should ha made in the public interest. But
we can do that in Committea. We will ba
here for several days yat, and, if necessary
we can stay here next week. This is a very
important matter, and thousands of people
are watching the action of the Senate at
this moment.
Why should we take a enap

SENATE
vote at ibis moment? Let us send tbis Bill tao
Coinmit e e.
Hon. G. G. FOSTER: Honourable gentlemen. 1 have listened with a great deal of
intercst ta what the Leader cf the Government and the Leader on this side have said
with regard to ibis mattor, and while I may or
may not regret that I withdrew my amendment
for the six months hoist, 1 (Iid il in what I
considered was a spirit of compromise.
I
sec now that miv action is flot geing ta lead
te that: there is tee much excitement in this
Chamber, tea nîucb interest in this Bill, proper or otherwise; and I would suggest that
the Leader of the Governnment, rather than
for-ce a vote to-night unon the amendment
of the bonourable member frein Grenaville or
the honaurablo Senator from Nova Scatia,
should adjourn this matter until ta. morrow.
qome Hon. SENATORS:

No, no.

Hon. G. G. FOSTER: In the meantime
we can see if semne arrangement cannot ho
came te ta prevent this continued confliet.
Hon. Mr. DANDU1IAND: I wauld suggest
ta my hanourable friend that he agree te my
suggestion, because it daoes flot put him in
any warse position than he was in befere.
He does net bind bimself te the principle of
the Bill. If he con.sents ta the secend reading
of the Bill without binding himself te the
principle. and we send the Bill te Cammittee
on Friday. I will see within five minutes that
Mr. Clarkson ta reached by phone and cemes
liore bY the night train. I cannot do se if
I have no mandate fromn te Se'ate.' I will
bave that mandate if we agree te the second
reiding and s'-nd the Bill te Ceimîttee.
Hon. G. G. FOSTER: If I am net bound
in any w-av by the reference te the Cemmittee
-if I am as free from this time onHon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Perfectly.

Han. Mr. MeLEAN: I would like te ask
the Leader of the Gevernment if Mr. Clarkson will have information bere to-merrew,
or when he cemes, shewing thase that are
simply depesirors in small ameunts, se that
baneurable gentlemen who are opposod ta the
Bill on principle mighl vote one, two, or
three million dallars te indemnify tbem.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will see that
Mr. Clarksen is asked te bring that informatien. When we are face to face with him
we will know exactly what wo can gel.
Hon. Mr. REID: Under the circumstances,
I would ýlike ta say that while I meved an

ADVANCES

BILL

MOTION FOR SECOND READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Hon. R. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 160, an Act ta preo ide for
faîther advances to the Quebec Harbour
Commissioners.
Ha said: Honourable gentlemen, the objeet of this Bill is te provide advances to the
Quebec Ilarbour Commission.
The second
clause of the Bill explains the end in vîew.
It écys:
2. The Governor in Cauncil may from time to tirne
advance and pay te the Corporation of the Quebec
1-sibotur Commissioners, hereinafter cailledt "the Corporation', ini addition te the moneys heretefore authc.rized te bc advanred t, the Corporation for the
construction of liarbour improvements by existing legisl.stion and which have not, at the date of the passing
of this Act, been se advanced, such sums of money,
million
1înt exceeding in the whote the sum cf fis e
dlollars, as tnay be rccu:red to enable tise Corporation
te corsplete the construction of terminal facilitie-s la

tihe harbour of Qaebec, for which the plans, specificatienis sud estimates have been appreved by the Goveinor ini Counril before the passing of this Act; and te
rolîstruci such addîtional terminal facilities as may be
likcwise approved as necessary, further ta properly equip
flic saîd port.

As honourable gentlemen know, Quebec bas
the largest, the deepest, and safest harbaur
on the cantinent of Nortb America. Quebec
is the naturail port of the St. Lawrence,
created witbout the aid of man, except for
the oquipment, whule Mentreal, my native
city, bas but an artificial hacheur. Yet the
city ef Mantreal, which is fartber inland hy
180 miles, holds the bloc ribben, and bas
beld il fer 100 vears.
The port of Qucbec is new camiag mbt is
oxn., mainly fer two reasons. I have beo re
me sttdies and reports of the Thirteenth Internatioatl Congress of Navigation, London,
1923. anti the stîmimaries of the reports made
te that Congress indicale that the passonger
carga liners are approaching a 750 length,
and a 36 foot loaded draughit. The report
says:

JUNE 17, 1925
It seems evident that no port which hopes ta handle
the largest classes of ships in general service should be
content with their efforts unless they provide for
draughts which exceed Sez Canal development, or
something of the order of 40 feet draught, within the
next quarter of a century.

The tendency, as will be seen, is towards
an increase in the tonnage of ships for the
economical carrying of goods on the oceans.
During recent years it has not been deemed
prudent to send to IMontreal a ship having a
draught of more than 27 feet, so that those
ships remained in Quebec. They cannot go
beyond that point unless it be to taike on a
part cargo in Montreal and to complete their
complement on their return to Quebec.
The second reason why the port of Quebec
is coming into its own is the fact that for
the past few years there has been a marked
lowering of the river level, and even ships
of 15,000 or 16,000 tons, going to Montreal,
have in the last three years been obliged to
limit their cargoes loaded at :Montreal and
to take on additional cargo at Quebec. I
have myself seen ships of that tonnage delayed for 24 hours in the port of Montreal
by being obliged to unload surplus cargo and
ship it iby rail, to ibe taken on again at
Quebec. In one season alone more than 30
vessels of the class I have just mentioned
have been obliged to limit their loading at
Montreal and to take on their complement
at Quebec. The Shipping Federation, which
had been content to have most of their ships
coming to Montreal and had not been interested to any degree in the development and
equipment of the port of Quebec, became
alarmed at the situation, and, after studying
the problem confronting them, they addressed to the Prime Minister the following
resolution, dated at Montreal, March 29,
1924:
The Memor:al of the Shipping Federation of Canada,
incorporated by Act of Parliament of the Dominion
of Canada, who own or represent 977,799 gross tons of
ocean and coasting shipping trading to the St. Lawrence route, with a capital investment of many millions
of dollars, a conaiderable portion of which is for Canadian Account.
(1) Whereas the accommodation at the Port of
Quebec for the larger class of vessels is entirely inadequate, and the draft of water available will not permit
usng ports above Quebec, and
(2) Whereas the berths available for ocean going
vesels at the Port of Quebec are now aill aslotsted for
the coming season of navigation and accommodation
is unavailable for any other vessels which may desire
to trade ta Quebec, and
(3) Whereas at the present time a large Passenger
Liner Con-mpany is seeking accommodation for its vessels at the Port of Quebec and none is available, and
(4) Whereas fully two-thirds of passengers and cargo
arriving at the Port of Quebec is destined ta other
provinces ip the Dominion, and
(5) Whereas the St. Lawrence route is the principal
artery of the ýtrade and commerce of the Dominion, and
any trade diverted ta ports to the south of us through

8--35

M4

failure to provide adequate accommodation, would be
a national loss, and
(6) Whereas the Government have atready spent large
suma of money in improving our aids ta navigation,
and the increased trade which has resulted therefrom
during the past twenty years has fully compensated
the country for the expenditures made, and
(7) Whereas the travelling public prefer ta go direct
to or from their homeland or their intended protracted
sojourn without passing through foreign territory, and
(8) Whereas your Memorialiste have had submitted to
them by the Quebec Harbour Commissioners a general
plan providing for the present and future requirements
of the Port of Quebec, which has received the unanimous endorsement of your Memorialists, and
(9) Whereas your Memorialists feel reluctant in re commending this plan ta the Government et such a
time Of finanuial stringency, but, nevertheless, are
strongly of the opinion that unless Canadian routes are
developed to the fullest extent possible, there is danger
o: Canada losing trade ta competing ports ta the south
of us, where immense sums of money are being expended
annually in providing modern ocean terminal facilities.
Wherefore your Memorialists are of the opinion that
an appropriation should be granted ta the Quebec
Harbour Commissioners to enable them ta commence
this national work as it may be pointed out that the
matter is urgent when it is considered that it will take
five years before any of the additional berthe can be
provided for the use of ocean traffic. Furthermaore,
your Memorialists have the greatest confidence in the
present Board of Harbour Commissioners and feel that
any money voted by the Government will be judiciously
spent in providing accommodation for the present and
future needs of the Port of Quelbec.
The whole most respectfully submitted,
(Sgd)
William I. Gear,
Chairman.
(Sgd)
Thomas Robb,
Secretary.

It was these representations, duly substantiated by other facts adduced, that
prompted the Government to declare at the
opening of this Session, through the lips of
His Excellency the Governor General:
It is the intention of the Government so ta equip
our important porte on the St. Lawrence route, and
on both the Atlantic and Pacifia coasts, as to enable
tbem to meet all requirements of modern navigation.

Quebec, as is stated in that memorandum,
needs more berths It has at present 22 berths
for ocean vessels, but only 9 of them can
accommodate the larger class of ship.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
addition?

Nine in

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No; nine out
of the 22. The Port of Quebec, under these
conditions, has been at times during the last
three years pressed for space, and it will be
more so from year to year. Honourable
gentlemen who have heard the reading of the
second clause of this Bill will have noticed
that the amount to be lent to the Harbour
Commission is $5,000,000, but it is to cover

year, and I urge that that work must be

started now. We are all familiar with the
elementary principle by which Governments
should be guided, and which is expressed in
the old saying, "To govern is to foresee." It
is our duty to have that necessary foresight.
There are some who are disposed to criticise,
and in the community we have of course the
class of pessimists. I confess that I am not
at present much concerned with the past, and
it is not my natural tendency to look backward. I am interested in present-day problems.
It is our duty to solve them for the future,
and we must look forward.
I have heard the statement that Quebec
has received considerable money in the past
and that it seems to have been an unproductive port, inasmuch as it has not paid
to the Government the interest on the bonds
which are held in the Federal Treasury. May
I point to honourable members of this
Chamber that there are two kinds of ports
in this Dominion? There are those that are
administered by Commissions, and there are
others under the administration of the Department of Public Works. Quebec has been, in
a sense, unfortunate, so far as bookkeeping
is concerned, in being under the Harbour
Commission system. The Commission is
supposed to borrow money and consequently
to owe the amount of money advanced. The
other system is a far casier way, as regards
is
bookkeeping, because the money whic
advanced to a port is given money, which is
not due by the port.
It has been stated that Quebec owed a
large sum in interest but if we do look back
it will be found that the ports of this country
have not been equipped by prayers alone.
There were perhaps prayers before money was
provided from the Federal Treasury.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: Before an election.
I have here a
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
statement which shows that if Quebec has
spent $12,000,000 in equipping the port to its
present state, Toronto has had lately-and I
do not know for how many years-a Harbour
Commission and has drawn upon the public
Treasury for the sum of $10,490,846; that
Halifax to this date has drawn $17,080,049;
St. John, $19,218,417; Port Arthur and Fort
No interest
William, together, $14,627,750.
has been paid on those amounts, and none is
expected. It was the Federal Government's
duty to equip those ports, just as it was its
duty to furnish money to the Port of Montreal
for its devellopment, to dredge the channel
from Montreal to Quebec and to advance
iioney to the Harbour Commission of Quebec.

I mention these figures in order to dismiss
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

the idea that Quebec has received special
treatment.
Quebec is not at the head of Lake Superior,
nor on Lake Ontario, but is the large, natural
deep-water port of the St. Lawrence. I would
friend that
point out to my honourable
Quebec has been in a somewhat unfortunate
position It had the right to expect, in view
of its situation it would attract to itself
considerable tonnage, but ships have in large
measure passed it by and has gone up the
St. Lawrence as far as they could-to Montreal.
But Quebec had to be equipped, and it was
the duty of the Federal Government to see
that it was well equipped, largely for a business
which was unprofitable to that porr, but
quite profitable to the country. Quebec had
to erect wharves and sheds for the reception
of our immigrants. It was costly to do that,
and it gave nothing in return. The Quebec
Commissioners have claimed that if some dues
had been imposed, as has been done in many
other countries, upon each immigrant, Quebec
would have been enabled, by the handling of
the large number of immigrants arriving there,
practically to meet the interest on a large part
of its debt. By virtue of orders from the
Federal Government, all boats carrying unmigrants have been required to stop at Quebec,
and the Port of Quebec has had to stand the
load.
I would draw the attention of the Senate
to this situation, of which, I suppose, most
of my honourable colleagues are aware, that
the St. Lawrence route is becoming more and
more popular for passenger service, and its
tonnage has increased in large measure from
year to year. The joint tonnage of Qubec
and Montreal-for they must stand together,
as the tonnage that cannot reach Montreal
must be handled at Quebec-the joint tonnage
for the years from 1917 to 1924 has been as

This shows the increased patronage en'joyed
by the St. Lawrence route, and the statement
that I read first, concerning the mavement of
ships at the -port of Quebec, indicates a, quite
healthy development.
We have been inquiring into the railway
situation lately, and we ail know that passenger traffie an railways is generally recagnized as being the unpraductive part, so far
as revenue is 'concerned. The freight is the
more profitable. But the passenger service
an ocean vessels represente a considerable
asset. I am nat prepared to, state exactiy
what is the proportion between passenger
servi ce and freight, but I knaw that the passenger returns of liners coming to aur ports,
in increasîng numbers and tonnage, indicate
that the nuniber of pausengers is very large.
lt is s0 large that people at the beginning of
the season wha desire 'La book passage fiind
that they must book ahead a month or two
before they can be assured of the necessary
reservation. 1 may add that we can hope,
from what has taken place in these iast years,
ta capture mare and mcre the touries fromn
S--35i

the American Middle West, ta say nothing of
our Canadian people. I was surprised to find,
in the last trip that I taak on the St. Lawrence, and in meeting Americans in Europe,
that from sueh ports as Boston on the
Atlantic we had people eaming ta Montreal
and Quebec ta take ships to Europe, and it
will be more and more to Quebea, because the
larger and better equipped veesels will have
to stop and take berth at Quebee.
With the greater knowledge that the
American people ta the south are gaining
of Canada, the knawledge that they can have
an ocean trip of four days instead of six from
their awn ports of Boston and New York, that
they can enjoy the river scenery for two days
instead of being tossed about on the ocean
wave", with the additional pleasure of a trip
down, the St. Lawrence, and the advantage
of finding* du-ring thase two days their sea
]egs, which. they do flot very easily do when
ieaving straight, from New York and Boston,
I am canvinced thýat within a few years the
St. Lawrence wili enjoy in a marked degree
a very large patronage fromn the United States.
That patronage, joined ta that -of our tourists
fromn Canada, represents quite a large benefit
ta the railways, ta the cities, and ta aur ocean
steamers. I am oonvinoed th-at if we do
what is necessary ta develop aur port facilities
for the largest type of paesenger vessels,
Canada will be the gainer.
The situation disclosed by the Shipping
Federation is ane ta which we cannat close
aur eyes. The Goverument bas feit that it
eould flot close its eyes ta it, because the
moment will soon arrive when a greater and
stili greater number of vessels will stand by
at Quebec, and flot go further up the river.
I belîeve it is aur bounden duty to start right
away on a programme of development in
order ta provide further berthe for this aceanvessel t-rade. I say thie without taking into
consideration the outward freight which may
at ýany moment flow ta the port of Quebec
through -a rearrangement af the railway rates
ta Quebec, and the impending movement of
immigrants which shauld come thraugh that
part, since the United States are making mare
severe their exclusion laws through the quota
principe.
With these few remare, I beg to move
the second reading of this Bill. I have the
plans -and estimates, -and the mode of expenditurc of this maney. I need flot detain this
Chamber longer; these are ail matters that
can be taken up in Cammittee.

My remarks will

My
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
honourable friend cannot get his second reading to-night.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I regret that I
cannot congratulate the leader of the Government on the specious arguments he has made
in introducing this Bill. I believe he has
been labouring under a great deal of difficulty.
I think it was only yesterday that, in answer
to a remark of my own he agreed that it was
time we curbed the expenditure of the
Government just now.
It would be useless for me to extend my
of the
remarks on the financial .ondition
country to-day. It has been remarked upon
by the junior member for Ottawa in the
debate on a question that preceded this. I
stated the other day that the debt of this
country, taking in the railway deficits,
It is a wellamounted to $3,331,000,000.
known fact that the Government of the day
is a-dding day by day and week by week to
that enormous debt. It has been stated in the
public press that the amounýt added to the
debt of the country since this Government
has come into power has been no less than the
enormous sum of $2,000,000 a wetk.
In the face of this tremendous debt, and
the lincreased cost of Government, I feel it
my duty to raise my voice in protest against
the expenditure of any further sum of money
that will add to the burden of the people of
this country, unless the matter is one of absolute necessity. The Bill that preceded this
one involved the adding of $5,450,000 to the
debt of this country. To-day we have anso
other Bill involving another $5,000,000;
that these two Bills would mean an additional
burden on the people of this country of $10,500,000 added tô the debt, which I think they
cannot very much longer sustain.
If there were any immediate necessity for
the vote of the $5.000,000 invoived in this Bill,
or if the honourable leader of the Government could show that there would be some
prospect -that the money wouild be spent so
that the burden of the country would be
lightened, I for one would be very glad to
vote for it. But what are the faets? I have
no desire to throw any reflection on the port
of Quebec, or any port in this Dominion which
requires additional money. The honourable
gentleman has stated that we have spent

Mr. L'ESPERANCE.

monley on Hallifax, on St. John, and here and
there, and now he says it is time we spent
more money upon Quebec. What kind of an
argument is that to put urp to the members
of this House?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I certainlv did
not make that argument. I sa-id that ail this
money was usefully expended, and although
there was no return in interest from Halifax,
Toronto, Fort William and Port Arthur, there
was no reason for not making the expenditure.
Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: Very good, but is
the fact that we have spent a lot of money in
those places any argument why we should
throw more in the same diirection?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
should equip our ports.

No, but that we

Hon. Mr. 'MoMEANS: These Bills are
brought down at a time when the press is
fulil of rumors of a general election. I do not
know about that, but I want to criticize the
expen:diture in Quebec. Sir Wi'lfrid Laurier
put this country to an expenditure of nearly
$200,000,000; I am not sure of the exact sum,
but we will put it at $170,000,000, and this was
spent for the purpose of making a port at the
city of Quebec. The object of building the
railway was that Quebec
Transcontinental
should be a great port, and should export all
the grain of the West, which was to flow down
the Transcontinental Railway, and through
that port. What has been the resuIt? $13,000.000 more have been voted to the port of
Quebec, and to-day the Harbour Commission
is indebted to this Government in the huge
sum of $8,000,000 for interest alone, on which
they have not paid a dollar. They had eight
years in which they had all the advantage
cf $200,000,000 that was spent on the Transcontinental Railway, by which the grain and
everything else was to flow through the port
of Quebec.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
had that advantage at alil.

Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: Last year, after the

bushels. Stili
comes to this House and asks for another
$5.000.000 to be thrown into the port of
Quebec, for which, in my humble judgment,
he can show no immed-ia:te necessity. The port
of Quebec has come along all right, so far as
it goes, but where is the necessity of adding

JUNE 17, 1925
to, the burdens of aur people an extra 85,000.000?
The honourable gentleman has read reports
from somne shipping association or something
else. I could caver this floor with demands
and reports for the expenditure of maney for
the oompletion of te Hudson Bay Railway.
Over that entire country they have associations, engineers and reports, and they want
ta camplete a port on Hudson Bay; but if
I were to-day in a position ta introduce a
measure inýto tItis House, ai ter an expenditure
af over "20,000,000, ta provide for $2,000,000
ta canmplete that road, I amn afraid I should
nat receive very much support fram the honourable gentleman opposite.
I understand that a very large sum of
money has already been advanced for the
purpase of deepening the St. Lawrence route
between Montreal and Québec; yet bore we
have the Government asking for $5.000,000
mare for a part which apparently cannot be
made a success, which is equipped to-day with
ail the necessary docks, and everything ta
acc*omimdate the traffie; anid they ask for
mare maney ta deepen the St. Lawrence and
take the freight away fram Quebec. That i.s
what it amaunts to, and there mnust be an
end of t.his sort of thing.
.I will tell the hanourable gentlemen that
the people of Canada are demanding an account fram the present Goverament. They
are demanding that the debt of this country
shaîl nat be increased. They are demanding
that there shahl be a curlb ta the extravagance
of this Government, and they will visit the
Gaverniment with condign punishment if they
will nat listen ta the vaice of the -people,
who, demand relief from the tremendaus burdens of taxation that press upon them at this
tÀme, and that those huge soins ai money
shahl nat be vated framn year ta year and
added ta that debt.
I have nothing further ta say. I have dane
my duty in raising my pratest against further
expenditure by the Gýovernnient unless there
is same strong reason and iminediate nocessity for it.
Han. Mr. L'ESIPERANCE: I beg ta mave
the adjourrnont, of the debate.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Before you do that,
I wauld like ta read a letter I have received
frein a very praminent gentleman in Queboc,
whoso naine I cannot give now:
In 1922 you may remember I approached you askinâg
you ta encourage the vote in favour of the grant tu

on the port, is absolutely unchanged since 1922. One
of the worst features of the case is that the present
harbour ia flot beiz kept up. Onie of the best shes,a
No. 20, on which over $20,000 was spent last year, le in
vcry bad condition, and I believe a steamer loading at
that berth, a very important one, would be unable t.ý
get grain, owing ta the carrier lbeing unsafe. A good
many thousand dollars will have ta be spent on that
section of the docks. I underatand the daniage is attributed ta the earthquake, but further capital expenditure on the present docks is being kepi well ln the
background tilt the present raid on the treasury le completed.

QUEBEC HARBOUR ADVANCBS BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resurned from yesterday the a&journed debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand for the second reading of Bill 160, an
Act to provide for further advances to the
Quebec Harbour Commissioners.
Hon. D. 0. L'ESPERANCE: As I have
been identified with the Port of Quebec for
a number of years, as -Chairman of its Harbour
Commission, I feel it is my duty, honourable gentlemen, to offer a few remarks on the
Bill flow under discussion.
I have listened with a great deal of interest to the explanation of this Bill 'by the
Leader of the Government. In so, ably presenting this measure he has given facts and
used arguments which I may have to repeat,
at the risk of tiring this honourable House.
I have also listened carefully to the remarks
of the honourable member for Winnipeg (Hon.
Mr. McMeans). Although I do not share bis
views, I have no fault to find with the way

%5

he has presented his case in answer to the
Leader of the Government. But the honourable member for Winnipeg, ini the course of a
very impressive address delivered in this House
last week, on the National Debt of this country, singled out this measure as a very extravagant and unjustified piece of legisiation.
Although he may have had a perfect right at
that time to use the words he did, I hope
he wilI flot be offended if I tell him that in
my humble opinion they were somewhat indiscreet. My honouraýble colleagues on both
sides of this House will bear me out, I hope,
when I say that in the course of a rather
long, if modest, public career, I have neyer
allowed myself to he stampeded by sentiment.
My stand on public questions of national import has been taken at the dictates of my conscience and judgment, and was ney-er governed
by passions raised in my Province or elsewhere. But I arn bound to say this to the
honourable member for Winnipeg: I am sure
that in bis address d'elivered last week he had
no0 desire to be unfair, or to prejudice the
case against the Port of Quebec. Ho)wever. in
denouncing so vigorously and opposing so
strenuously a measure which had not yet
reached this branch of Parliament, 1 regret
that my honourable friend did flot realize
that he was opening the door for another of
those campaigna of m'isrepresentation from
which some of us have suffered so much in
the past, and which have done so much harm
to this country.
It has been said, and very truly, that transportation is the key to national prosperity.
I shall, therefore, approach this question flot
rnerely as one of great importance to, my
city and district, but also as one which is of
vital interest to the whole Dominion.
It is true that we are face .to face with a
very serious financial situation, due in great
part to our acute railway problems. However, I do not agree with those who believe
that economy and retrenchment alone will
save this country. I submit that this was not
the policy followed in times gone hy by the
big men whoma history records as nation
builders. Let us apply the knife wherever
waste or extravagance exists. On the other
hand, we must not choke the avenues of trade
which are susceptible of great development,
and will co-operate to a large extent in obtaining that volume of traffle we need if we
are ever to solve our railway difficulties.
Have any serious efforts ever been made
to adiopt a sound national policy as regards
the co-ordination of our pàrblicly owned railways, canais and harbours?
I have no
hesitation in answering in the negative.

house in quoting statistics with which you are
It is sufficient to say that
all familiar.
although this Dominion is blessed with three
transcontinental roads having access to Canadian harbours, second to none in the world,
it stands to our shame that over 50 per cent of
our exportable grain finds its way across the
ocean through American railways and American ports.
Quebec is one of the largest deep-water ocean
harbours in the world. The threatened lowering of the water in the St. Lawrence above,
through deforestation, or the diversion of
water from the Great Lakes to the Mississippi,
by way of Chicago, cannot affect that port,
because it is near enough to the ocean to be
on tide-water, which gives it the distinct
advantage of an assured depth of water at
all times.
By the deepening of the St. Lawrence above,
Quebec has lost her supremacy of old, in
so far as vessels of a certain draft are concerned; but the fact remains that Quebec
is, and always will be, the only port on the
St. Lawrence which vessels of the largest
type can reach at all times and be safely
harboured.
For many years, up to 1912, the port of
Quebec has been handicapped by lack of
adequate facilities for vessels of a large draft.
It was in 1912-13, under Sir Robert Borden's
Government-and I wish to say here, en
passant, that the port of Quebec never had
a better friend and a more intelligent sponsor
than the distinguished and eminent statesman
who was then presiding over the destinies of
our country-it was in 1912-13, that the port

progamme of works, outlined by the regretted
Sir William Price, its first Chairman, after the
reorganization, provided for the construction of
a few deep-water berths in the estuary of the
river St. Charles. In 1916, when I succeeded
Sir William, this programme was continued,
with the addition of two modern concrete
sheds, and the completion of the grain elevator,
which has now a capacity of 2,000,000 bushels.
Upon completion, these berthing facilities
were utilized by the large vessels of the Canadian Pacifie Steamship Company and the
Cunard Steamship Line.
There are now seven deep-water berths
having shed accommodation which are used as
follows:
Three berths, on the breakwater, just about
enough to take care of the steamers carrying
passengers and jmmigrants.
When unoccupied, these berths are used by oceanbound steamers from Montreal, which have

The seventh berth, opposite Shed No. 29,

formation is to the effect that by the leasing
in 1924 of berth and Shed No. 29 to the
Cunard Line for a number of years, the last
deep-water berth has been allotted, and there
remains none available for other large vessels.
This assertion is well borne out by the
resolution of the Shipping Federation of Canada, fron which I quote the following paragraphs:
Whereas the accommodation at the Port of Quebec
for the larger class of vessels is entirely inadequate,
and the draft of water avalable will not permit usng

JUNE 18, 1925
This resolution was passed in 1924, and my
information is that the situation as flot improved since.
Lest we forget. our friends are good enough
to remind us once in a while that the Harbour Commissioners have flot as yet paid
interest on the moneys borrowed fromn the
Dominion Government. True; but this may
easily be explained by the fact that in the
past the Port of Quebec bas been mostly used
for the landing of immigrants who have
corne to this country each year in numbers
averaging from 75,000 to 100,000. This traffic,
which makes use of the best facilities of the
port, is yielding no revenue; yet these facilitics have to be maintained yearly at considerable expense, and have also to be improved frequently at the request of the steamship companies. Moncys have to be horrowed
in that respect, on which an annual intercst
is charged to the Harbour Commission.
The dredging of the channel between Quebec and Montreal bas cost this country considerable sums of mooey. This channel xvas
built, not for the Port of Quebec, but cxclusively for the Port of Montreal; without
it, the Port of Montreal would not exist.
However, the interest on the millions of dollars di.sbursed for the deepening of the
channel is not charged against the Port of
Montreal, but is borne by all the taxpayers
of Canada. Why, therefore, should the Quebec Commîssioners be compelled to build and
maintain facilities for immigration which
benefits Canada at large. and be charged interest on the moocys thus spent, while the
port is not allowed to derive revenue or to
receive compensation in respect thereto?
The Harbour Comunissioners have just complcted the building of a modemn cold-storage
plant to take care of the exportable dairy
products manufacturcd in the vast and prosperous farming districts trîbutary to that port.
This cold-stora-ge plant will remove one of
the principal obstacles whicha have prevented
steamers fromn making a greater use of that
port. With facilities for perishable goods,
grain, cattle and packet freight, it will now
be possible for steamers to load at Quebec
combined cargoes, which were not obtaînable
in the past. To confirm this, 1 arn informed
that the number of inward- and outwardbound vessels using the port of Quebec in
May increased by about 25 per cent over the
sanie period last year, with a comparative increase in tonnage. Quebec has also the distinct advantage of being nearer to Winnipeg
than any of the other Atlantic ports. It is
linked to this western distributing grain

f

centre by one of the best, if flot the best,
graded railways in the world.
The harbour of Quebcc is 500 miles nearer
to Liverpool than is the port of New York. It
is served by the Canadian Pacifie and tîjo
Canadian National railways which have direct
access to its docks. As a passenger gateway
between Northèrn Europe and the North
American continent, 1 need not tell my hionourable colleagues here what its advantages
are; they know thema as well as 1 do.
During the season of navigation, Que'bec
stands unrivalled as a passenger route. It is
becoming more and more popular and better
patronized by aIl classes of travellers. The
advertisement which Canada and the St. Lawrence route receive from this source cannot be
estimated in dollars and cents.
The London Congress of 1923, held under
the auspices of the International Association
of Navigation Congresses, at which aIl nations
were represented, came to the conclusion that
the best type of shi'ps for ail purposes were
ships. of 20,000 to 25,000 tons. The supership of 40,000 tons and over, is impracticable,
while the small types are no longer profitable.
There was also read at that Congress a very
important report by Mr. L. H. Saville. Chief
Engineer of the Admiralty, from which I will
quote two paragraphs. which have a very
important bearing on the question before us:
The Vercentage nuiber of vessels of 30 feet draught
and over la et present very emBUl,but it is on the
mecresse, and there is littile doubt that when the Suez
Canal la deepened to 40 feet. the percentage mimber
above 30 feet draught wifl be greatly increased and
first clasa Ports would do well to afford a depth in
their apyproach channels flot mauch inferior' to that of
the Suez Canal.

WAnd then hie
adds:
A frrst-elass passenger harbour serving the Atlantic
trade will require to provide depth in the neighbourhood of 40 feet at low water.

Who makes this statement, honourable gentlemen? Not your humble servant, not the
Quebec commissioners, not the 'Shipping
Federation of Canada. No, it is the naval
expert and chief engineer of the British Admiralty.
As I have already sta'ted, Quelbec is, and will
ever be, the only port on the St. Lawrence
which can accommodate ships of 16,000 tons
and over. If we couple to -these favourable
factors and to these undisputed natural advantages of Quebec the certainty that some
day the St. Lawrence river will 'be navigated
well into February, I submait thgt Canada and
the British Empire have in the port of Quebec
an asset which it is not possible to overestimate.
That I may not be taxed with exaggeration
in making sudh a sta-tement, allow me to quote

M4

SENATE

an extract from a report prepared by the
celebrated British experts on port construction, Messrs. Coode, Matthews, Fitzmaurice,
and Wilson, of London. In 1913, at the request of the lamented Sir William Price, this
firm sent two of its members, Mr. Coode first,
and then Mr. Wilson, to enquire and report as
to the best means of developing and equipping
the port of Quebec, and also on the possilbility of extending the period of its activities.
After a long and thorough investigation, here
is the conclusion of the report they made as
regards the extension of navigation on the St.
Lawrence:
Hitherto, the period of open navigation has usually
lasted from the end of April to the beginning of December in each year, but we understand that the
prospects of extending this period into February, at
least, are sufficiently promising as far as navigation
betiween the ocean and Quebec is concerned, to warrant
ait enqu ry into the question of its feasibility. In view
of the congestion which occurs under present conditions
in handling the grain of this country, and the unique
position which Quebec would then occupy amongst
Cainadian Ports, anv such extension of the period of
open navigation, provided the port were equipped with
requisite facilities, must result in enormous gain to
Quebec and to the Dominion generally.

Just a few words, honourable gentlemen,
and I will conclude my remarks. I regret having detained you so long; my excuse is that I
have seldom abused this privilege. While I
have an unbounded faith in the ultimate success of the port of Quebec, I must confess that
when last year I heard of the plans of the
Quebec Harbour Commissioners I was not at
first impressed with their emergency; but,
after the information which bas been given
that these plans have received the approval of
the presidents of the Canadian Pacific and
Canadian National railways, I have altered
my views. We have also the testimony of
the highest authority in the matter, the Shipping Federation of Canada, to the effect that
the work on these plans should be proceeded
with at once, as it will Itake five years to
complete them and before they can be utilized. It has not been customary in the past
for large Montreal interests to bother or worry
very much about improvments in the port
of Quebec. There must indeed be a very strong
and a very urgent reason when such a highly
responsible hody as the Shipping Federation,
having its headquarters in Montreal, makes on
behalf of our port a request couched in such
strong and unmistakable terms. No one knows
better 'han the Shipping Federation. which
represents all the interests using the St. Lawrence route, of their present and future projects with regard to the utilization of the port
of Quebec.
No one knows better than the Shipping
Federation the national disaster that would

Mr.

L'ESPERANCE.

befall this country if we were to advertize to
the world to-morrow that we have declined
to further equip the only deep-water port on
the St. Lawrence which can and will ever
be able to accommodate those types of ships
which have been recommended by the London
Congress of 1923, and which, according to one
of the greatest naval experts of the world,
will in the near future displaoe all other types
of vessels on the Atlantic ocean.
So far as I am concerned, I am not prepared
to assume the responsibility of telling this
honourable Chamber that the Shipping Federation of Canada and the Presidents of our two
great systems of railways have formed an
alliance with the Quebec Harbour Commissioners and the Canadian Government for
the purpose of deceiving the taxpayers of
this country. I am satisfied that in supporting this measure I am serving the best interests of Canada as well as those of my
city and district.
Hon. J. 'G. TURRIFF: Honourable gentlemen, I had not intended to take any part in
this debate, for the reason that during the
greater part of last Session and the early part
of this Session I was unfortunately not in
condition to give the attention that I had
been accustomed to give to measures that
came up in this House. However, when I
come to consider the present situation of
this country, and a proposition is put before
this House ,for the voting of an additional
$5,000,000 for the further equipment and
deepening of Quebec hatbour, it strikes me
very -forcibly as an uncalled-for and unnecessary expenditure at the present time. I have
visited the port of Quebec on several occasions
of late years, and I must say that each and
every time that I have been there I have
observed the huge wharves and huge sheds
and all the necessary attributes of a great
port except goods to be shipped. The goods
were not there: they were not going there.
So it strikes me that the harbour facilities are
quite sufficient for the present.
I want to say just here that I am an old
Quebec boy and that my sympathies are entirely with the city of Quebec. I think Quebec harbour and the city of Quebec have been
crucified in the past, and by every government of Canada. But I think also that when
the Harbour Commissioners of Quebec come
forward and ask that such a large sum as is
proposed be voted, they should present information which would satisfy the honourable
members of this House that the expenditure
was absolutely necessary. There may be in
the shipping season a day or two when the
port may be crowded, but the facilities of

JUNE 18, 1925
Québec have neyer been used to their caqiacity,
and they are flot used to their capacity at
the present time.
A *great argument is mnade, cd the lacet that
wheat is not sent down there for shipment.
They have a two-million 'bushel elevator.
An elevator of that size is capable of handling
six to eight times its holding capacity. A
two-mi1lion bushel elevator could put through
from 12 to 15 or 16 million bushels a year.
What have they ever had to ship through
that elevator? If my information is correct,
about five million bushele ie the greatest
quantity that bas ever gone through that
elevator in any one year, and in most years
the quantity has been coneiderably lese.
Now, why go to the expenditure of another
$5,000,000 unitil the present oaiseeity is used?
1 arn sure that the merembers of Parliament, of
boih Bouses, will readi¶'y and gladly give the
neoessary vote to secure additional facilities,
if it can be shown -that they are necessary.
Nothing wvould igive me greater plýeasure than
to, feeld and see 'that the harbour of Québec
ne.-ded anoitJer $5,000,000 in order to handle
tE traffic coming that way.
Take the matter of wheat. Does anybody
here think that there wili ever bemueh wheat
shipped througb the port of Quebec? If any
honourable mrember here is under t.hat impression, he, is in, my estimation dabouring
under a great misapprehension. And who is
it that keeps (the wheat frora goin-g to Quebee?
Cliieely, to-day, the Government of Canada.
It is maimly because of the action of this
G.overnmemt,, and of aIl the Cavern-ments in
the past, that it bas been rendered difficult.to
ship wheat to Quebec. There is one thing
tliat we mnust ail 'bear in mind, and that is
thaît there ie no sentiment whatever in the
dealers -in wheat any more ýthan there je in
shippers of or dealers in practically any other
commodity. Wheat will go 'by the easiest and
cheapest route, wbether -through Canada or
througb the United States.
Bon. ýMr. DANDURAND: Before the hionourabie gentleman stresses that poinit, inay I
ask that, as lie bas made the very broad statement that the Government of Canada je preventing wheat from, flo-wing thro-ugh to the
port of Quebee, he wii'l kindtly e3qplain that
thought?
Bon. Mr. TURRIFF: Certainly, I shail he
most happy to do that. I was coming to, it
in a Ettle whi-le.
Hon. Mi'. DANDTRAiND: -I thought the
honourable genit*eman was pesing over it.
Hoa. Mr. TUR.RIFF: Oh, no. I tbin-k I can
convince rny bonourable friend, whom I ad-

5M5

mire very imuich, and who je very reasonable.
I iparticufla'rly admire bis adroitness and
suavity, and has ability in getting his legislation through this Bouse, though he, often
meets a pretty firm and numeroue opposition.
Therefore I shall be very pleased to give him
my ideas of wby the Government is to a
certain extent responsible.
We bui't the National Transcontinental
railway anme years ago. The eatement bas
been made time and again, by a-Il ithe heaýd
men connected -with the building of that road,
that it was builit, for one reason, in order to
lielp the grain-growers of Western Canadia -to
get their grain landed in biverpool or other
foreign -markets at the sehea 4pest (possible rate.
Lt was sta#ed that grain could 'he carried more
cheaply by that hune than it had been carried
by rail and water in tihe ipast. Shortly aiter
the road comaneneed operation, in order to,
carry out that purpoçse, the 'Governiment of
Canada made a rate of six cents a husheil from.
Armstrong, -a point on the Transcontinental
corresponding to Fort William or Port Arthur
on the, C.P.R.-six cents fromn Armstrong to
Québec.
Bon. MT'. DANDURAND: Mt what date?
Hon. Mr. TURRIVF: It was shortly afterward.
Hon. Mr. OHIAPAJi: lt was in 1919.
Bon. Mr. ïVoMEANS: In 1916 the rate was
made.
Hlon. -Mr. TURRIFF: That was the time
tbey raised the rate?
Bon. MT'. MdMIEANS: No.
Hoa. Mr. TURRIFF: But that was the rate
tbat was made; and I heard mry honourable
friend the Senator fTom Grenville (Ilon. Mr.
Reid), wbo was then Minister of Railways,
make the statement on the floor of thie Bouse
that grain could. be carrîed for six cents a
bushel froam Armerbrong to, Quebec witJhout any
lose to the railway. Well, if itbat rate had
been kept in force, *much more grain, would
have gone to Québec than is going at the
present time.
Hon. MT'. TURGEON: It wou.ld a&l have
gone.
Hon. Mr. TURÇRIIFF: But what wats done
shortly afiterward--done, I bavé no douibt, st
the instance, largely, of the barons of Montreal? That riate was changed to--how much?
Twenty-five cents a bushel. In the face of
that am I jutified or amn I nat justified in
saying that to a large extent the Governiment
of Canada have been responsible for wheat
not going to Quebee?

556

SENATE

Remember that, as T said before, when they
increased that rate ito 25 cents a bushel, it
was just killing the trade. As I have said,
wheat wil'i go by 'the cheapest route. Onequarter of a cent a bushel less will divert it
to the chea.per route, no matter where that
route is.
I have heard some criticism made during
the -last month or two by peopile in Canada
against one of tîhe Western grain companies.
I think it was a Saskatchewan company.
Hon. Mr.
operative.

WILLOUGHBY:

The

Co-

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: The Saskatchewan
Co-operative Company-for building an elevator in the city of Buffalo. Well, whose
fault is that? It is largely the fault of the
Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAN'D: But the Government does not fix the rates.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Yes, the Government does fix the rates to a very large extent.
Those people had intended to build at the
eastern end of the Great Lakes. Before going
to Buffalo they pointed out to the Government that our Canadian boats were taking
wheat to Buffalo, a day's sail farther than to
our own ports, for less money than was being
charged our own people, and they asked that
under those circumstances, when wheat was
being carried to Buffalo for hall a cent less
than it was carried to our own ports. a day's
run nearer, the Government should step in
and suspend the coasting laws. The Government refused to do so. The matter was
brought before the Minister of Railways, and
he said: "Why should I do it?" And he did
not do it. The Saskatchewan Elevator Company then said, "We have to get our wheat
to foreign markets as cheaply as possible."
and they built their elevator at Buffalo. That
location has many advantages.
They can
ship from Buffalo to Montreal; they can ship
from Buffalo to New York; they can ship
from Buffalo to Boston-to any of the seaports. That is the reason why the wheat is
going there. That would not have been the
case if the Government had answered their
question in this manner: "If our boats carrying wheat to American seaports for one-half
a cent a bushel less than they will charge
for carrying it to our own ports, although they
have to sail a day farther, we will suspend
the coasting laws and allow American vesss
to come in and carry our wheat down to the
lower end of the Lakes at as low a rate as
it is being carried to Buffalo." Indeed, it has
often been carried to Buffalo for 2 or 21 cents
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF.

a bushel less. Therefore I think I am justified
in saying that, in this respect at all events,
the Government is partly to.blame for the
lack of traffic going to Quebec.
The deepening of Quebec port was a point
made. It was stated that by this means
Quebec would be able to handle the wheat of
the West more cheaply. Do you think, honourable gentlemen, that if that were being
done, or if it were possible to do that, the
farmers' representatives in the other Chamber
would all be utterly and absolutely opposed
to this expenditure. which will add another
$5,000,000 to the debt of the country, and
which they feel will not give the grain-growers
of the West the advantage of a single cent
in the next ten years? Can you wonder that
they are not in favour of this legislation?
The reason is that, while it adds to the debt
of the country and the taxes that the people
will have to pay, it is not going to bring
them any return.
The case is largely the same with regard
to cattle. There are at Quebec the finest
facilities in Canada for cattle shipments. I
quite agree with what bas been said by my
honourable friend from the Gul, that the
facilities at Quebec for handling catie are
equalled nowhere else. Why is it that cattle
are not shipped there? In the year 1923,
about 5,000 odd hcad went through the port
of Quebec. In the year 1924 there were, I
think, 1,505 head. I am pleased to notice
that so far this year-and it is yet early in
the season-according to my information,
about 5,000 head have gone through Quebec.
There is no reason why practically the whole
cattle trade from the West should not be
shipped across the water from Quebec. That
port is over a hundred miles nearer the West
by the Transcontinental railway than Montreal is by the Canadian National or the C.P.R.
So there is no reason on earth why cattle,
at all events, should not go through Quebec.
There are much better advantages and much
better prospects in handling the cattle trade
through Quebec than there are in the handling
of wheat through that port.
Now, honourable gentlemen, it is not only
the $5,000.000 that we are voting. I remember
that about three or four years ago at the .most,
there wavs a Bill before the House to grant
Quebec, I think, $5,000,000.
Hon. Mrr. DAJNDURAND:

No, $1,500.000.

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Ia that all?
Hon. Mr. CHAPAIS:

$500,000.

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I had it in my mind
tiat the expenditure, over a term niof years,

JUNE 18, 1925
was to 'be $5,000,000. However, I accept the
correction.
I hear it stated on aiýl sides that this $5,000,000 is to start new work altogethar; and,
froro ail iI can learn, the Quebec harbouir bas
not yeit been taxed ýto its caparcity. If we
vote this $5.000,000, it ,means the starting of
nýew work. Where is that going to, land Canada? I have seen it statad in the press, and
have heard ýthat w.hile ithis $5,000,000 wi'll st.art
the work, there is no question that bafore the
work is completed the .cost ýwill ba 820,000,000
That may or 'may flot be so, but can anyone
point to harbour works or other public works
in the Dominion of Canada, under any Government, where the amount evantualdly expen-ded to complete ithe work was flot practicalIy double the estimate of the cost? In
starting this work, we are starting a work that
may cost us anywhaTe fromn $20,000,000 to
$40,000,000.
I do flot want ito be srmaili1 or picayune, honourabla gentlemen. Canada is a great country, and I think Quelbec harbour is entitled to
equipment just as muoh as 'Montreal1 or Vancouver; but I feel that this is&not the tima
for it. This is a time when Canada, is fairlýy
staggering under a Joad of debt a.nd taxation.
Is thera any prospect of that iload being reduced? 1 quite wed1l rememiber four years

economny, and a question' of the expenditura
of $5,000,000.
Hon. Mr. TURRLFF: I caîn tell mny honnurahia friand ývery quidvly and vary ems4phaticailly why 1 did that. 1 voted yesterday for
some paymcnt to the poor depositors who
lost their monay in.' the Home Bank because
the Govern.ment suapported iby myr honourable
friand haýd known. for yaars and yaars, ithrough
the Finance ýMinister, that the Bank was
rotten and insolvent, and because the mnombars of thiat Governimenit, and their colleagues
sat in, their seats and allowed the peopyle of
Canada to put 410,000,000 more into the Bank.
And, as 1 stated yesterday, whan the present
Governmant took office iit didý exavtly the same
thing. The result is that a great deal of the
money has been lost, and the Goveromants
that have been in power till now are rasponsibla for that loss. Possibly thay ara not
legally repùnsible; ipossibly no action oould
ha taken ;against tharn; nevertheless, they are
responsibla. 1 claimn that a vote in favour of
that Bill is far more justifiable, aven if the
whole amount should ha ipaid, -than.a vota for
the $5,000.000 that is n-ow un-der considceration.
My honourable friand the Leader of the
Governmant is asking for 85,000,000 to furthar
equip the harbour of Quabec. I have noted
in the press that the Governmant proposes to
spend $17,000,000. 0f course this monay will
not ail ha spent at once. $5,000,000 is to ha
spent in daapaning the Quebec harbour to
accommodate the bi.g ships, *and At is proposed to spand 817,000,000 in Montreal so that
the big ships will not have to stop at Quebea.
Is that common sensa?
My honourable friand from Quabea (Hon.
Mr. L'Espérance) argued vary strongly that
the ship of the future wvould ha a big ship.
Well, I have noticed during the past yaar or
two that the day of the big ship is overthat thare will ha no more big ships. Two
of the hig ships that want to Quabec last
yaar are flot going thara this year. Big ships
of 20.000 to 30,000 tons are not a profitable
investment, and it is being found that smallar
vessais ara more profitable because the cost
of maintenance whçn they are not busy is
vary much less.
There ara facilities anough at the port of
Quebec for a great trade, and I hope to liva
to sea that trade going through that port.
But, in the name of common sanse, whila
Canada is in har presant parilous financial
condition, I say that by alI means wa should
go easy, and should not undertaka this expenditure.

SENATE
Honourable gentlemen on this side of the
Flouze, and on the other side f00, have very
often complained about the West getting low
rates on the railways. I happened to be looking up some of the figures of charges for
carrying freight, and I found that in many
irnstances wheat was carried on the railroads
in the East much cheaper than in the West.
1 arn flot complaining of that, but 1 do nlot
tbink honourable gendemen should complain
that they are paying higher wbeat rates in
the East than we are in the West, because
mn many cases that is not so.
There are many other points that 1 migbt take
up, bonourable gentlemen, but 1 do not intend
f0 stress this matter any further than f0 say
this. We do not know whaf Quebec bas cost.
We know thaf some $22,000,000 bas been ex-

pended, and that there is $8,000,000 due for
simple interest. If the interest werc compounided if would be more than double that
amount. But we do not know what the Department of Public Works bas spent on the
harbour of (2uebec; we do not know whaf the
Department of Marine and Fisheries b as
spent. This is information that should ýbe
given to this Housc.
In this respect al
Covcrnýmenfs in the past have been the
same. We sbould be able to get ail the information ax ailable in connection witba important Irgislation like this.
The Bill is
brouglit down in the dying days of the
Session, and we have no possble opportunity

Hon. Mr. TLTRRIFF: 0f course, having no

money if would not be so bad; but tbis is
oniy a picce of the wvhole. Let me give you
twvo or tbree other instances which I tbink
go f0 Justify us in re.iecting this Bill. Take
the Mont real bridge. 1 understand that some
$10,000,000 will be involved in that-a large
sum af least-and, according to my information, the Board of Trade of that city, the
mefropolîs of the Dominion, called a meeting
affer flic announcement that the Gox ernment
would build this bridge, and ifs members. the
biggest men in the city of Mont real, passed
a resoluf ion condemning the proposai, saying
fliat if was nof necessary, or at ail evenfas
thaf it was premature. Now, if the members
of the Board of Trade of Montreal fake that
position, is the country justifled in going on
with that work at tbe present time?
Take the Prince Rupert elevator. Does
anybody think that wheat is going out by
Prince Rupert. If is proposed fo build an
elevator there wbich will cost $1,000,000, 1
suppose. To my mind fliaf is a political expenditure.
Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: A million and a
haîf.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Thaf f0 my mmnd is
an expenditure tbat is going to add to the
debt of Canada, and froma which fliere xvii
be no returo.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: 1 do not fhink a
¾nhlof grain was ex er shipped from Prince
Rupert.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Take fthc Halifax
elevafor: does anybody think thaf is a justifiable expenditure?
We have spent some
$16.000,000 or $17,000,000 on the Halifax
harboor already, and now if is proposed t0
buiid an elevator.
Wbether if is f0 hold
grain or f0 imiplement past promises I do not
know. If grain is going f0 be shipped to thrlower Provinces, why sbouid if not be shipped
f0 St. John? Then they xvould want flie railway, wbich, Lord knows, is making a deficif
quick enougha, f0 carry that grain on to
Halifax. I did not think f0 look up flie
milcage, but Halifax must be 200 or 300 miles
farther than St. John. Wliy not do away
with that extravagance?-because it is an extravagance.
We aire not in a position f0
build fhese public wvorks wben there is no
possibulity of gefting a dollar back, f0 Canada on the expenditure made.
Take flic Welland Canal. We have already
spent over $50,000.000 on it. I think the
Welland Canal will lic neccssary in the future
when fthe St. Lawrence route is decpened;
but what eartbly good is if going f0 lie to

JUNE 18, 1925
Canada until we go on with the deepening
of the St. Lawrence from Lake Ontario to
Montreal? I think the deepening project is
a good one, but we have already spent $50,000,000, and there is another $50,000,000 ta
be spent before it ls of any use. That goes
to prove what I said a while ago, that every
publie work costs practically twice as much
as the estimate. The estimate was $50,000,000, and it is going to cost over S100,000,000.
In the meantime, on the $50,000,000 there is
$2,000,000 or 83,000,000 of interest every year
being added ta the debt of Canada, and every
year we have ta pay $2,500,000 or $3,000,000
in extra fixed charges. Where are we going
to land if this expenditure keeps on?
Hon. Mr. WATSON: The port of Quebea.
My genial friend
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF:
frorn Manitoba (Hon. Mr. Watson) says we
are going to land in the port of Qucbcc. I
wiil gladly vote for that port when I think
these improvements are needed and justified,
and when they will give sarne return ta Canada in anc way or another, but I do nat
think the time bas yet carne.
I do nat like ta say what I arn naw about
ta say, but I think it is the truth. I believe
it, and I have made up my mind ta say it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Shall we
close the doors?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: No; I arn always
prepared ta give my views in the open. I
want ta say that, in my judgrnent, if the
policy that is at present being carried out by
the Gavernment, and being fareshadowed, is
flot stqpped in the near future, anly one of
three things can be the result. The first is
bankru-ptcy and repudiation; that is not a
nice thing ta say. The second is the driving
out of aur population ta the UJnited States,
wbere taxes are being eut in twa. That wauld
be just about as bad as the first, by preventing us, through the lessening of aur population,
froni paying the enarmaus taxes that are being increased frorn year ta ycar. But, further,
and in my judgrnent worst of all-and I
hate ta mnention thc subject in this House,
but it is being discusscd ail aver Canada,
particularly in the lowcr provinces--if sorne
change is flot rnade, the resuit will evcntualily
mean annexation.
I want the Governmcnt ta beur in mmnd
that these big expenditures are not gaing ta
help thcm with the electorate. My cxperience while a rnember af the House of
Commons was that wbencver I had any public
works--and in ail my experience I only had
two country public buildings--they cost the
Governm.ent votes, and also cost me votes.

I felt that I cauld nat alloyw this oppartunity ta pass witbaut making niy mast
earnest protest, nat frorn ûny ilI-fecling ta
the part of Quebec, for 1 would like ta be
able ta, vote for this Bill; but I feel that
unless samething is doinc ta stop these tremendous additions ta aur debt the consequences will be vcry scrious. I notice that
the Supplemcntary Estimates eall for another
$9,000,000. If sorncthing is not dane I can
sec nothing ahead but that we will land in
anc of the positions I have outlincd.
My honaurable friend from Mantarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) the other day gave a
very dismal picture of the farmers, spcaking
particu]arly of bis own province of Quebec,
but bis remarks applied ta farrners ail ovei
the country. Hc said that something more
ought ta be donc ta briog in people, and hc
pointcd ta tihe fact that the Government and
the two chief railways werc spending $6,000,000 on immigration. In my opinion the plan
he suggested would not amount ta very much.
for I believe that to-day we are nat holding
the immigrants that corne in, and that their
number is not as great as that of tbhe migrants
from Canada to-day; so that the spending
of that 86,000,000 is just another of the extravagances. Why, I saw in a report ta the
other House that for travelling expenses of
the officiaIs of anc Departrnent we paid nearly
a million dollars last year. I cail that ta thr
attention of my hanourable friend.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANiS: I think the honourable gentleman should give us the name of
the Department.
Hon. Mr. TURRIPF: I am not afraid ta
give the name: it is the Department of Agriculture. If such things continue there is only
anc landing place that I can sec, cither bankruptcy, or people leaving this country, or
eventually bring about annexation. I therefore beg ta move:
That Bill 160 be not now read the second time, but
be referred to the Standing Committee on Railways,
Tolegraphs and Harbours for further information and
consideration.

The Hon. the ýSPEAKER: I have not bad
time ta look inta this motion, but I do nat
think it is in order at the present moment.
Such a motion would came in after the
second reading of the Bill.
Han. Mr. TU7RRJFF: Then I will move
it when the second reading cames.
Hon. L. C. WEBSTER: May I add a
f ew words ta those whicb have been so ably
addressed ta the House this ýafternoon by the
honourable member from the Gulf (Hon. Mr.
L'Espérance) in support of this Bill, wbicb is

to provide new terminals along the river front
of the St. Lawrence at the citv of Quebec.
The application for a vote of $5,000,000 is
the resuilt of very careful study of the whole
St. Lawrence river route, and the necessity is
very ably put before us in the memorandum
which has already been read by the honourable leader of the Government and also by
I
the honourable member from the Gulf.
merely wish to submit that this memorandum
shows the necessity for these terminals in the
citv of Quebec.
This memorial of the Shipping Federation
of Canada is the product of an organization
representing one million gross tons of shipping, wvith a capital of several millions of
dollars invested in steamships, which ply at
present to Canada. The memorandum states
very emphatically that the port of Quebec is
entirely inadequate for the larger class of
vessels. Again, it states that the St. Lawrence
route is the principal artery of the trade and
commerce of the Dominion, and any trade
diverted to ports to the south of us, through
failure to provide adequate accommodation,
would be a national loss. Further, that the
general plan presented to them bv the Quebec
Harbour Commissioners, providing for present
and future requirements of that port, has
their unanimous endorsement.
I understand that those statements have
been confirmed by the officials of the Canadian Pacific Raiiway Steamships. Limited, and
by the Canadian National Railways. Further
approval of this application iN civen by the
Department of Marine and Fisheries, whose
official. trusted employees of the Dominion
of Canada, have made a very careful stud'
of this question in al its bearings, and have
anproved of this application.
The port of Quebec may be properly
termed a national as well as a natural port.
Thousands of immigrants have passed through
its gates, and I may say to the honourable
member who preceded me (Hon. Mr. Turriff)
that I trust thousands more will come through
the gateways of the St. Lawrence to settle
in our western provinces.
It is truc that Quebechas not shipped as
large a quantity of grain as some of us had
hoped, but I do not think that the port of
Quebec should be blamed for this smaller
quantity. There has been and still is considerable controversy over what may be considered
a fair freight rate from the West to Quebec, to
which the rail-haul is several hundred miles
shorter than to any other port. When this
rate situation is remedied there is no reason
whv more grain should net be exported, provided facilities are ready to meet the requirements for the exporting of grain.
Hon.

Mr. WEBSTER.

In 1904, as the member from Assiniboia
(Hon. Mr. Turriff) has said, it was stated that
grain would be carried to Quebec at a very
low rate; but I would ask honourable members if that rate was ever granted to the
exporters of grain for more than a very short
period. I ana told that a promise was given
that grain might be carried for 6 or 8 centý
a bushel from the western provinces to the
port of Quebec.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: My honourable
friend does net mean that; he means from
Armstrong or Cochrane, not from the West.
No, not from
Hon. L. C. WEBSTER:
where the grain grows, but from the junction
Some 17 years later, in 1921, this
point.
matter came up before the Board of Trade
of the city of Quebec, when representatives
of the Railway Board met representatives
of that city, and it was cleary pointed out
that that promise had not been fulfilled. The
answer from the Railway Board to the
citizens of Quebec was: "Yeu have not the
proper facilities in the city of Quebec to take
care of the enormous quantity of grain that
you would receive if we were to put this low
freight rate into force." But when Harbour
Commissioners ask for a grant of $5,000,000
in order that the harbour may be properly
equipped to take care of the exporting of
grain, they are immediately met with the
reply that has been given here this afternoon: " Why, there is no grain going through
the port of Quebec; therefore why do you
require to spend $5,000,000?" So the Harbour Commissioners Of Quebec are placed in
a vicious circle. On one hand, they are told
they have net the grain, and on the other
they are told they have not the port facilities
to handle the grain.
The lowering of the depth of water in the
channel between Quebec and Montreal is
forcing the larger vessels to complete their
loadings outward at Quebec, and when more
modern and larger vessels are employed in
the St. Lawrence route Quebec must be the
ocean terminus of all those vessels. If yeu
will pardon me I will read an editorial in a
Montreal paper of Monday, June 1, which
says:
1I The Port Of Montreal Going Dry?
Has the Feleral Government, by voting $5,000,000
foi harbor imaprovements at Quebec, shown a comimendable foresight by anticipating the time when the
Chicago diversion will make the ship channel to Montreal impossible for large-ships? It is an alarming fact
that the water in the Port of Montreal to-day is
betw-ecn four and five feet ýlower than it was at this
tim" last year. The depth to-day is 31 ft. 10 in. as
compared with 36 ft. 1 in. a year &go.
The Chicago Sanitary District is to-day diverting
more water than ever from the Great Lakes, not-

JUNE 18, 192556
withstand.ng the judgment by a Supremne Court ini
delluociat.on of tbis action. There is nothmng to indicate that the Ch:'cago authorities intend to take any
steps whatever to reduce the diversion to the amnount
aLoe d by the treaty. Meadiwhile thie water in the
St. Lawrence is ainking lower and lower evexy year
and it :s a matter for anxiety that to-day we have in
ti shilp channel to Montreal, even at this early period
of the year, only a saed niargin over the diraft of the
qarger ships.
Diversion of water by Chicago, agamest which a
solemn iîîdgment haq been handed down by the Supreme
Court of the United States, is beneficial flot only to
Chicago itself but in increasing the navigable capacity
of the Misaissippi and to that extent decreasing the
rîi'airy of the St. Lawrence route f roma the Great
Lakes te the aea, because the Mississippi, by the explo.tation of water througb the Chicago drainage canal,
piov dca a navigable route from the Great Lakes to the
oit:f of Mexico.
We should hate to think that the Government is
tlîrowing up its hands i0 the fight against Chicago's
action but after &Il it xnay be the part of wisdoen to,
see to it that facilities are in existence ini Quebec in
readiness for the time when the -water level beco«nes 60
low that ocean liuers cannot corne to Montreal.

Only to-day honourable gentlemen may
have noticed in the Ottawa Citizen an item
headed, "Water level of the St. Lawrence is
unusually low." This item points out that
the St. Lawrence river is lower this year than
it has been for some years past, and that the
loas created in decreased- carniage will total
over 812,000,000 for this year. It adds that
the vessai owners on the lakes attnibute the
Jessening of the water levels to the Chicago
steal, and so on.
Now, hýonourable gentlemen. there is no
reagon why, with proper facilities, Quebec
should flot take cane of the cattie export trade
of this country, to the great advantage of our
farmers. It can provide pasture accommodation where the cattie can be taken from the
cars a couple of days before loading them on
the steamers, watered and fed before shipping,
which every fariner knows is of great
value. Every fariner knows te value of
sucit treatinent of cattle pnior to shipinent.
Steamship companies will tell you that the
greatest mortality among cattie occurs hatween Montreal and Quebec, aspacially during
the hot days of summar. The cattie have been
loaded at M-ontreal direct from cars into
steamers, and it is well known that the greatest
bass occurs on that short part of tha route,
when they are being taken down the St.
Lawrence betwaan Montreal and Quebea.
There, is another question, honourahle gentlemen, which is occupying the minds of ail
Canadia.ns to-day, and that is the question
of immigration. What class of immigrant does
Canada need most aÀtthe presant turne? It is
te farmîng class, which will come from. Great
Britain or other counitries in Europe. What
can titis country do to assist in bninging here
thousands of immigrants from United States,
S_-36

Great Britain or other countries? We must
offer thein as good prospects as thay can
obtain anywhere elsa.
WVe have the best cattle in the world; we
have the hast wheat in the world; and we
have, via Quabec, the ehortest route for the
carniage of our produets to the markets of
the world.
Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: You are forgetting
the Hudson's Bay Railway.
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: It would require
ice hoats to carry the traffic that w.ay. With
proper steamship accommodation and facilities
at our own St. Lawrence ports we should be
able to give our farmers the full banefit of
reasonable and cheap transportation and place
thein in tbe most advantageous position to
compete with any ýother country.
The resources and natural products of
Canada are so extensive ànd so valuabla that
in connection with the transportation and
export of these producta we are forced to
consider carefully our port facilities, to assist
in every way their davelbopunant, and to provide adaquata aquipinent, sa, that, with the
adju-stinent of freight rates, cheaper and more
effective ways may be annanged for the shipment of the Canadian grain crop, Canadian
cattla and Canadian goods via Canadian
ports, especialIy the port of Quebee.
I fiave mueit pleasure in supporting the Bill
that is before the Bouse.
Hon. JULES TESSIER: Honourable gentlemen, I do not like to give a silent vote on
this question. My words, I know, will noît
have te saine authority as those of the
honourable member who bas just sprjkan. He
is one of
te principal merchants of the
Dominion and is much better acquainted witb
thesa questions than I am,.
I have listened attentively to the speech
made by the honourable member froin Assiniboia (Hon. MT, Turniff), and was pleased to
heaa, hum give suait praise to the port of
Quebec. In fact he pleadad te case of that
port with a great deal of eloquence. Almost
all bis arguments were in favour of it. Ha
said that Quebec was one of the safeat harbours in the Dominion; that it was neaner to
Europe than New York or any other port in
.Canada; that it was muai nearer to the West,
via the Transcontinental, and trade could come
Vo Quebec much more easily than Vo Montreal.
He even added that ha was9 a Quebec boy.
So lie showed how mueh sympathy lie had for
the port of Quebea. He gave ai sorts of
arguments in favoun of that port, and only
one argument against it, namely, the need

member on the other side pointed out, his
tendency to economy was not so strong
yesterday, when he spoke in favour of the
grant of $5.000.000 to the Home Bank deIn any case, thel honourable

member must recognize that there is a
difference between saving and false economy.
It is false economy, when you have a property,
not to spend money on it in order to make
it valuable. My honourable friend, who had
property in the Northwest when he was living
there, and who still has property there, knows
that in order to obtain revenue from your
property you must spend money on it. The
port of Quebec is a valuable asset of the
Dominion. It is a national asset. But how
can you expect trade to come to that port
if it is not properly equipped to accommust be provided
Quebec

with adequate facilities. The money that we
are asked to lend to that port will be spent
honestly. It will give value to the property
and revenue to Canada, for it is the property
of Canada.
Further, there is no dou'bt that, since the
Transcontinental Railway was built to bring
trade to Quebec, as stated by my honourable
friend from Assiniboia (Hon. Mr. Turriff),
when the Government sees to it that proper
and reasonable rates are fixed, so that grain
and cattle may be brought to Quebec by the
Transcontinental, we shall have plenty of
trade in Quebec. And that must be done.
There must come a day when the discrimination which, as everybody knows, is now
exercised against the port of Quebec, will
disappear. Quebec must have justice. There
must be a proper tariff; not an exceptional
tariff, but one on the same scale as the rates
to other harbours and big cities in the Domimion.
An honourable member who sits on the
other side of the House read yesterday a
communication from a person whom he did
not name, but whom he represented to be a
merchant of Quebec. I must say that that
was only the opinion of an individual, and it
can easily be set aside. I hold in my hand
a document which expresses the opinion of
practically all the merchants of Quebec, for it
comes from the Board of Trade of that city.
It says:
Whereas the trade on the St. Lawrence route bas increased, since the War. in large proportions, both in
the volhme of imported and exported gonds;
Whereas the number of passengers travelling abroad
froua Canada and the United States of America on
veseis running on the St. Lawrence River bas also
increased to a considerable extent;
Hon. Mr. TESSIER.

Whereas the ocean tonnage as a consequence, has inert.'sed during the last five years, in order to meet the
requirements of this traffie;
Whreas this increase in trade v.a the St. Lawrence
route calls for vessels of larger size in length and
draught;
Whereas the Port of Quebec is the farthest Inland
port on the St. Lawrence River having a sufficient
natural depth of water to accomodate vessels of a large
tonnage;
Whereas the facilities presently available at Quebec
are inadequate to meet the requirements of large sized
vessels;
Whereas it is in the National interests that the
diversion of the Canadian-borne traffic to the United
Stites seaports be averted, and that the proper facilities
be provided on the St. Lawrence River for these large
vesels, so as to meet the policy of "Canadian Trade
via Canadian Ports."
Whereas the Quebec Harbour Commissioners have
submitted plans for future Harbour developments providing for new berthing facilities for vessels of a large
draught;
Whereas these plans have received the most careful
consideration of this Board, and pppear to be most suitable, both as to the sites selected and freight handling
facilities to be erected;
Wlereas it is urgent, in order to meet the present
and crming requirements of the Shiipping trade that
these new improvements be built at Quebec without
delay.
Resolved: That the Quebec Board of Trade, an incorporated body representing the different commercial,
muanufacturing and shipping interests of the City of
Quebec, and district, approve of the Quebec Harbour
Comin, ssioners' plans for new Harbour improvements
which are necessary and urgent, and give their strongest
support to their application for a vote from the Parliamuent of Canada to provide in the Port of Quebec
these new facilities for vessels of a large draught.

of the Board of
That is the resodution
Trade, which is supposed to represent the entire trade of the district of Quebec. Against
that declaration the opinion of a single
merchant cannot stand.
There has been some opposition to the
proposed advance of $5,000,000 by the Government to the Quebec Harbour Commission for
the puxpose of providing additional berths and
grain storage for the larger class of ocean
eamers, which draw too much water to allow
them to go on to Montreal. The Montreal
Gazette, after quoting the recoîmmendations
of the Montreal Shipping Federa.tion in favour
of the projeot, goes on to say:
That is the case of Quebec. Its harbor needs development to accommodate larger ships until the channel to
Monteal is deepened, and so the money is to be spent.
There is, however, another view to this expenditure of
public money. Sir Wilfrid Laurier used to beguile and
bamuboozle the electors of this province with the
promise that the Transcontinental Railway would produce a volume of traffic large enough to engage all
th. facilities of the ports of Montreal, Quebec, Three

In speaking of Montreal and Quebec, the
Gazette says: "One pays its way, the other
is a defaulte.r." That is hardly a fair statement. It is true that Montreal pays a low
rate of interest upon its debt to the Goveroment, and that Quebec only pays interest upon
its bonde held by the public, and flot on those
held by the Goveronent. But a harbour
trust is flot a joint stock company, nor a bank,
bound to earn enough to pay a certain
dividend. Is it not rather, the medium for
the proper direction of a public work, created
for the good of the trade of the country?
If the Quebec Harbour Commission had

Government for the splendid facilities of

think that any one contends that Montreal
should pay interest upon the many millions
expended in deepening the channel between
Quebec and Montreal, nor upon the $16,000,000
to be expended during the next ten years in
inereasing its deptha from 27 feet to 35 feet.
And yet it may be contended that the expenditures are for the benefit of Montreal alone,
a contention however which cannot fairly be
maintained, 'because the whole of Canada

others stl do, t(hat that railway would act
as a regulator of lake freight rates, and would
also bring to Canadian seaporta a good share
of our Western grain trade which now goes
to New York and other United States seaports for export. It was built for that purpose. It shorten6 the distance from Winnipeg
to Quebec and Halifax by more than 200 miles,
and, with the Quebec Bridge, it has cost
Canada $180,00,000. It was tried for one
year, 1916, and the resuit was a brisk season's
business for Quebec, and a good share for
Montreal. But, as the freight rate of 6 cents
per busfhel was immediately raised, and is
n0w twenty -and three-quarter cents, which is
prohibitory, ail the business ie driven into
the boats at Fort William and finds its way
by water, the bulk of it, to Buffalo and New
York. The boat-owner-3 are clever. Competition being removed, they charge about
1l cents per bushel to carry wheat by water
from Fort William to Montre-al, but they
take it to Buffalo for 2 cents. The result ie
that the shipper can afford Vo pay the 9J
cents charged by the railwaye from Buffalo

But the Canadian Pacifie railway is also

Hon.

Mr. TESSIER.

There is no question of competition between
Quebec and Montreal in this matter. It is a
question of trving to get back as mucli as we
can of our grain trade that has been diverted
to United States seaports, and of creatinir
facilities at ail our seaports that will enable
us to handie the rapid increase in quantity
that past experience foreteils for the future.
The report of the special committee of the
Senate under the chairmansbip of the honourable memiber froma the Gulf (Hon. Mr.
L'Espérance), xvhich studied this question
three vears ago, recommended three tbingsý
to the Government:
(1) To make freig-ht rates over the Government railwavS to ail our seqports--Montreai,
Quebec, Halifax, St. John, Vancouver and
Prince Rupert-so cbeip that it wvill be profit.able for the farmer to send i ls wheat to
Canadian instead of United States seaports.
(2) To provide adequate grain storage and
docks at ail those ports so that they may be
able to handle the trade.
(3) To arrange that the rates of marine
insurance from Canadian seaports shial be the
,ýsu-nie as from New York.
The Sonate unanimously adopted thât report
of the Committee which shiudied these questions very assiduously. So the present proposai is nothing but a consequence of the
work which n'as done. We aire now asking
tlýit the Huse adhere to the same conclusions. ani I hope that this Bill xvii pass.
Hon. T. CHKPMIS: Honourable gentlemen.
I do flot intend to nuake a speech on this
question. Ail the explanations and arguments
have hecn given to this Hoibse in a most
honourable
the
manner b'
illuminating
Senator for the Gulf Division (Hon. Mr.
L'Espérance). who is sureiy an authority on this
naltecr, having been for many years the
President of tbe Quebcc Harbour Commission.
I wush onlv to mention some authorities tbat
h vbeen 'ilready named in this Huse, and
to s~t forth, fi-oms these authorities, a chain
of argument w'h'ich eeems to he unanswerable.
1 xvili mention first the authoritv of Mr.
Beatty, the President, of the Canadian Paýcifie
Railway Company of Canada. In a letter
written to the Rigbt Hon. Mr. Mackenzie
King. the Prime Minister of Canada, in connection witb this question, he made the
followin1g statement:
I have heen asked to indicate the attitude of the
Canadian Pacifie Railway Company as to the necesity
of tliese expenditures at a tire when the Governerit
is deeply concerned by the neessity for economny, and
whether or not, if the projeet were favoura.bly conside-e'1. there would be any objection to it from the
standpoint of this coinpany.
I have indicated to the members of the Quebec Harhour Board that if the circumastances are as they have

JUNE 18, 1925
outined them, greater facilities et Quebec will have
te be provided in the not to distant future-

That was written a year ago.
-and that I felt that they were performing a real
public duty by bringing the facts to the attention of
the Federai authorities.

That is the first part of the statement
made by the President of the Canadian Pacifie
Railway Company. Of course, in making that
statement he did not forget that he was the
head of the greatest railway corporation in
the world, and immediately he said:
The new docks ta be provided wili be adjacent to the
trabk of the Canadian National Railways, and those
tracks in the immediate vicinity of the pier it is the
intention of the habour commissioners to take over
and operate as part of the dock system. The Canadian
Pacifie coud only obtain access to the new piers by
arrangements for joint operation of the line of the
National Railways froua Bélair, and if an arrangement
on favourable terms could be made this company
would not offer any objection to the project.

Thit was keeping in view the legitimate
interest of the Canadian Pacifie Railway in
connection with the proposed improvements
in the Quebec Harbour. Then he added these
words whieh have a great bearing on the
question under discussion:
As to the need of additional port facilities at Quebec,
there can be no doubt if the lowering of the water
levels is to continue-

And it is going on.
-and increased use of that port is to be made by
vessels of large tonnage.

That is the first link in the chain of argument I want to put before the House.
Then comes the Chairman of the Canadian
National Railway, Sir Henry Thornton. He
gives his opinion. He says:
The scheme proposed represents the only really satisftrtory plan for future expansion, and it bas our hearty
endorsement.

Then he thinks of the Canadian Pacifie
Railway Company, and answers to the wish
expressed formally by the President of the
Canadian Pacifie Railway in the following
lines:
Should the docks you contemplate be buiet we will
be glad to consider any sort of a reasonable arrangement for the purpose of giving the Canadian Pacifie
Rsilway satisfactory entrance to the site you have
selected.

Here are the two presidents agreed. One
says, a"We must have access to the new
faelities;" and the other says, "Of course, you

shali have that."
adds:

Then Sir Henry Thornton

I am net in a position ta say exactly how urgent this
scheme may be, as that depends upon information which
will have to come from the shipping interests.

I want to be fair to Sir Henry Thornton.
He is noncommittal as far as the urgency
and the importance is concerned. As he says:

565

That depends upon information that will have to
come from the shipping intereste.

Now, that is the second link in the chain
of argument. Well, after the declarations of
the President of the Canadian Pacifie Railway
and the President of the Canadian National
Railway, here comes the statement of the
Shipping Federation of Canada. It has been
quoted by honourable gentlemen who have
spoken before me, but there are one or two
points that I must refer to. They say:
The accommodation of the port of Quebec for the
larger class of vessels is entirely inadequate.

They know something about that: they are
the best authority in Canada on that point.
They continue:
The d.raft of water available will nat permit using
ports above Quebec. The berths available for ocean
groing vessels at the Port of Quebec are now all allotted
for the coming season of navigation, and accommodation is unavailable for any other vessels which may
desire te trade through Quebec.

And further:
At the present time a large passenger liner company
is seeking accommodation for its vessels at the Port
of Quebec and none is available, and fully two-thirds
of passengers and cargo arriving at the Port of Quebec
is destined te other Provinces in the Dominion.

And here is the end of it:
Your memorialists are of the opinion that an appropriation should be granted to the Quebec Harbour
Commissioners to enable them te commence this national work-

It is not a local work; it is a national
work.
-as it may be pointed out that the matter is urgent
when it is considered that it will take five years before any of the additional berths can be provided for
the use of ocean traffic. Furthermore, your memorialists
have the greatest confidence in the present Board of
Harbour Commissioners and feel that any money voted
by the Government will be judiciously spent in providing accommodation for the present and future needs
of the Port of Quebec.

There you have the three of them: the
Chairman of the Canadian Pacifie Railway,
stating that it is needed, that it is good, and
expressing the wish, of course, that if these
facilities are to be made, his railway should
have access to them. The second link in my
chain of argument, is the letter Of Sir Henry
Thornton stating that of course it should be
done, but that as to the urgency of the
matter we must rely on the authority of the
Shipping Federation of Canada. And. third,
comes in the statement of the Shipping
Federation, that it is needed, that it is a
national undertaking and should be done
without delay because four or five years will
he required to complete the work.
I do not want to detain the House at any
length oa this question; I want only to sum
up very briefly the main points of the case.

SENATE

566

Quebec is one of the national ports of Canada.
Geographically and physically, it is
one of the finest inland harbours of the world.
At the present moment its facilities are inadequate, and the limit of its needed accommodation, even for the actual trade and
transportation activities, has been reached.
In support of this statement I am not going
to quote again the declaration of the Shipping
Federation of Canada.
If we take into consideration the forthcoming development which is undeniably going to take place in the trade and transportation business, the accommodation of the port
of Quebec will be ever more deplorably deficient. Therefore the proposed new facilities
are necessary, and they are urgent, for the
very good reason that they cannot be conmpleted in less than four or five years. Those
facilities not only will provide for the expansion of our trade and transportation through
Canadian channels, but they will be a powerfuil means of making the port of Quebec a
paying proposition, and of enabling the Quebec Harbour Commission in the near future
te pay the interest on the loans, and provide
for a sinking fund which will wipe away,
within perhaps less than twenty years, the
indebtedness to the Government of Canada.
For all these reasons, I think this Bill is
fully justified, and even if I were not a
citizen of Quebec, as I am, I would surely
vote for the second reading of the Bill.
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON:
Honourable
gentlemen, just a word in connection with this
subject. Seldom bas a measure of sucb importance and involving so much prospective
expense come to this Chamber with so little
information accompanying it.
Before entering into a discussion of the Blil,
I would like to refer briefly to one remark of
from Assiniboia
the honourable gentleman
(Hon. Mr. Turriff) which I think is pertinent
and proper a.t this time. On March 1lth last
the Senate met afiter having been adjourned
for fiv e weeks and found an empty Order
Paper. A vigorous pro-test was made, which
was joined in by the Leader of the Government, who agreed that we were justified in
urging upon1the Government-and be promised
to do so upon our behalf-the necessity of
sending down important legislation at as
ewly a date as possible. Still, yesterday and
to-day we have been discussing Bills that in
my humble opinion might have been submitted to us at a reasonably early date, so
that they could have been given full consideration and careful investigation. I am
sorry that we have to deal with such imHJÀ.

MIr. CHAPAI S.

portant matters in the dying days of the
Session.
Now, just a word in reference to the St.
Lawrence water levels. Those of us who were
born and reared on fanms know that if you
have some dead water ,that needs to be drained
off, you dig a ýditch. and, I do not care whether it is plough furrow or a fifteen-foot deepering of the St. Lawrence, the water is drawn
off more quickiy by deepening the ditch; and,
entirely regardless of the effect of the Chicago
drainage canal, a ten-foot deepenin-g of the
St. Lawrence channel east of Montreal
is
going to lower the water in the St. Lawrence
river. Therefore the time undoubtedly has
come when the harbour of Quebec will be
u,tilized for ocean-going vessels that will not
be able to reach the port of Montreal, and I
am in entire sympathy with providing the
port of Quebec with facilities adequate to its
requirements as and when those requirements
appear.
We have a proposal before us, however,
that is not confined to inproving the present
Quebec harbour faci'lities, but is the nucleus
of an entirely new prognam of a new port in
a new location, as I undemstand it. The port
of Quebec, as at present situated, has been
built up very substantially at the public expense, without any return on the money invested. It is ilocated in what is known as the
St Charles river basin. That locaition was
carefully considered and finaly adopted after
most careful engineering investigation had
been made, and that location is, as honourable
gentlemen know, capable
of expansion to
probably twice its prescnt caipacity. This
proposal, as I understand it, is for a new harbour construction at a new ,ocation above the
Ci-tadel of Quebec, on the imain deep waterway of the St. Lawrence river, and ithe prospective cost of the completed project is at
least $20,000,000.
I question whether this
House should give appr.oval to the launching
of an undertaking of that sort without some
reasonable information being placed before
us as to what the plans are, who is going to
execute them, whether there is to be any
supervision or control on the part of the
Quebec Harbour Commission over the expenditure off this large amount of money, upon
which ýthere is no immediate prospect of a
return to the country, and whether or not it
is really necessary that the work shoudd be
commrenced immediately. I fecd very strongly
that the House ought to have accurate and
detailed information concerning the general
project-what is contemplated. what is the
neoessity for it, and what is the present traffic
through the present port.

on account of having the lowest grade, so that
the power of a locomotive of a certain size
is greater as compared with the Canadian
Pacific Railways or Grand Trunk systems.
I have therefore much pleasure in supporting this Bill.
Honourable gentleHon. O. TURGEON:
men, this Bill is in line with what I have been
advocatine all my life, and honourable gentlemen who were with me in the other House
in past years will find that I have nothing new
to say. but will simply repeat what I have
been saying for years past, as to the necessity
of utilizing our national ports on the Atlantic
and the Pacifie. and on the St. Lawrence as
well.
Anything that can be done in that
direction is a national benefit.
I believe it is time that the port of Quebec
should be recognized for all the advantages
it enjoys by nature. eserially in its depth of
water, which is not likely to be lowered by
any set of circumstances; and I believe the
time has come when theore is a necessity for
providing accommodation for large draught
vesels and modern facilities such as harbours
require to-day. The harbour of Quebec should
be perfected so that it can accommodate all
the traffic that will come to it, and cope with
the necessities of increased trade, because we
know that vessels of large draught are bound
hereafter to be the carriers of traffic over the
orean. As our trade increases our national
ports will require more facilities, and we will
need a greater number of them. I remember
that it was said by the late president of the
Grand Trunk Railway, Mr. Hays, when speaking of the construction of the Transcontinental
line. that Canada would need not only Quebec, St. John and Halifax, but a dozen more
barbours along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.
The question of transportation is the life
of Canada. There is perhaps no country in
the world ex ept the -United States where
transportation is so fundamental to the existence of the nation, on account of our vast
resources of all kinds scattered throughout
4,000 miles of territory, from one coast to
the other. We may say that those resources
are unecxhaustible if we take the proper means
to develop them and transport them to other
countries.
I will support this measure, knowing more
particularly that the usefulness of the Transcontinntal line from Winnipe to Quebec is
being miore and more recognized to-day, not
only in every part of Canada, but in foreign
countries also. That svstem can bring wheat
from Saskatchewan and Manitoba cheaper
for the farmer on account of its construction.
Hon.

Mr. McCORMICK.

With one engine it can haul three times the
tonnage that a similar engine on the Canadian
Pacifie can take to Montreal or Portland.
That line is of special advantage to the cattle
trade, because it is a smooth line from Winnipeg to Quebec, and the cattle are not
shaken and tormented as they are on other
roads where the roadbed is not perfect, as
this one is.
The shorter distance between
those points also gives more rapid transport,
and when the cattle reach Quebec we may say
they are in as good condition as when they
left Winnpeg, and they reach the other side
of the ocean in better condition and with
less loss in weight than if carried by any
other railway. This alone is a valuable consideration.
Quebec is coming to be recognized as a
great national port, and should be equipped
with all the possible advantages for the requirements of the future. I will therefore
vote for this ncasure.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
In answer to
the question of my honourable friend, in
allowing him the right to proceed, and then
retaining the right to follow and close, I
desire to say that I cannot well understand
why we should not vote on the principle of
the Bill at this moment, for the very simple
reason that a serious question is put to the
Senate and to Parliament.
That question
may be stated thus: In view of the representations of the Shipping Federation, that is
alarmed at the lowering of the water level
between Quebec and Montreal; in view of
the fact that steamers that used to take their
full shipload in Montreal have been obliged
to stop at a certain moment in loading because
of the insufficient depth of water; and in view
of the fect that in one season 30 ships of from
15.000 to 16,000 tons, which used to load fully

JUNE 18, 1925
in Montreal, have been obligad flot only to
abstain from loading fully, but to unload, and
lose 24 hours by sending a part of their cargo
on tha rails to Quebec, and taking it up when
they arrived at Quebec; viewing those facts,
and, on the principle of advaneing 85,000,000
to complete and develop the port of Quebec
for the purpose of allowing it to handle the
large vessels that will ba obliged perforce to
stop in Quabec, shall we take tha rasponsibiity
at this moment of saying that we will flot
accept the advice that ia given us, with the
danger facing us within a yaar or two or three
that the diversion of water at Chicago may
still further lower the levai of the St. Lawrene
and leave the ships and the ship companies
with the obligation of frequenting the southern
ports rather than coming up the St. Lawrence?
This is a great danger that we have to
face. If the Sanata daclares that it is ready
to face it, well and good; but, with the statamants that ara before us, with the affirmation
of the Shipping Fadaeration. whose interests
are most concentrated in Montreal, that in
thair opinion practically the fate of Montreal
is linked to that of Quabac, I balieve that
we should daclare here and now that we shahl
not take the rasponsibility of postponing the
aquipping of the port of Quebec, but shall
proceed to develop it adequately.

the location, the plan of development, and
the cost.
Hon. Mr. ROBER.TSON: Wilhl my bonouirable friend permit me? My suggestion
was to sand it to the Standing Committee
on Railways, Talagraphs and Harbours--not

on it.
Éon. Mr. DANDURAND: But my honourable friand knows very wehl that wa are

ô

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We have
no information before us.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 have here a
statemient of the expenditure, and I will lay
it before the Huse in due time. The whole
issue at presenit is whether or not we shall
comply with the request for an extension of
the port of Quebec and its proper development. That is the only question to-day. As
to the manner in which thýat is to ha done,
T wonder if it is worth while referring it to
the Railway Committee to hear the engineers
from Quebec, or the engineers of the Govtrnment, and decida upon the merits of the
location and the expenditure to be made. I
have the plans and the figures, and will lay
them bafore the Senate; but surely these are
details that can be left to the engineering
experts. Surely the Harbour Commission and
its engineers ought to deride as to the best
location. They have consulted the two railway companies. We know the exact location:
it is just below the Chateau Frontenac, and
along the St. Lawrence towards Wolfe's Cove.
We know that it is a splendid frontage on
the St. Lawrence. AIl these facts are known
to us, and it seems to me that what we have
now to decide is whether or not we shail take
the responsibility of denying the resquest of
the Shipping Federation that we begin now
to develop the Port of Quebec so as to provide for the possibilities of the morrow.
My honourabla friand from Welland (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) has admittad that there is a
danger, and that it may go on increasing from
yaar to year if we do not succeed by diplomatie means in preventing the diversion at
Chicago. In the face of that menace, shahl
we taka the risk, of disorganizing aIl our transportation facilities and advantages on the St.
Lawren ce? 1 for one am not ready to assuma
that responsibility, and 1 ask that this question and the principle of the Bill ha now.

Lakes have been kept for the past sixty years?
And is it not a fact that on more than one
occasion-on more thýan tan occasions--the

the rivars as it is to-day? I have a copy of
the record of the past sixty yaars.

If there is no

Hon. G. G. FOSTER:
Honourable gentlemen, I desire to make an explanation for
the vote I am going to give.
At 6 o'clock the Senate took recess.
The Senate resumed at 8 o'clock.
Hon. G. G. FOSTER: Honourable gentlemen, had it not been for the statement
made this afternoon that there was, or
might be, some jealousy between the ports of
Montreal and Quebec, ilt is quitte possible that
I might have thought I could discharge my
duty by voting without explanation. But,
having lived my life in Montreal, I want
to assure the honourable members of this
House that nobody can justly say that there
is in that great metropolis the least jealousy
towards the port of Quebec. There is no part
of Canada in which Montreal takes greater
pride than in the history, the progress and the
success of the city of Quebec, and it is unfair and untrue to insinuate, for any purpose,
that any feeling of jealousy exists.
I coneratulate the honourable Senators for
the Gulf (Hon. Mr. LEspérance) and Stadacona (Hon. Mr. Webster) on the earnest,
sincere and splendid way in which they have
apealed to this Chamber. I can understand
anIl appreciate in every way their pride and
interest

in that port.

The vears of faithful

service which the honourable Senator for thn
Gulf rendered as head of the Quebec Harbour Commission, and the years which the
honourable Senator for Stadacona has sper'
in the commercial life of that city and the'
great interests there, well entitle them tcome here and urge the right of Quebr'
and the development of that port. But it musi
have been apparent to every honourable Senator that, after they had spoken, with all their
earnestness, and the honourable leader of the
Government had finished his statement concerning it, this House had not been given adequate explanation or proper details concerning this project. considering the amount of
monev that is at stake and the future commitHon. Mr. DANDURAND.

ments of this country that are being made
by- it. If we knew all about this project, I
do not know but that the House might
feel disposed to devote a certain sum of money
towards making a start with it, were it not
for this other reason against it. But we are
told plainly that it is a matter of $20,000,000
-85,000,000
this year, S15,000,000 in years to
omae-and from the moment that we are commited to the, principle hat the development
shaill be undertaken. the people of this countrc are committed to the expenditure of $20,000.000. And who is there here. with the experience that we have all had in publie developments in the past, who has had any
figures given to him to show that $20,000.000
or $30,000,000 or 340,000,00 is the lirnit of this
expenditure? I have not received from any
source to which I have applied the information
that enables me to intelligently understand
what this commitment means.
I cantnot understand, if the port must be
developrvl why we do not go on and ýdevelop
it at the place where the other development is. Some people say that mud runs
down the St. Charles river; others say there
are difficulties ,that we have not had fully
explained. So far as I can see, it is the height
of folv for us to talk about the development
tbat is piotured in that book, without having
the fulilest detaiils about the possibility of
developmient at the old port at much less cost.
Although I have had no experience as an engineer,. but hiaving had experience in public
works of this kind, I do not believe the developttent pictured to the honourable .memhbos of this House can ever be built for

85.000 900, $10.000,000, $15.000,000, $20,000,000
or 330.000.000. I am not at all sure that a
smaller ex.'penditure in the other place would
not achieve ail thalt is necessary.
But there is arother point. What about
the incom farn ths inuestment? $20,000,000
;
at .5 per ccnt is wlat? We are askKnz the
peopae of ti country to put up S1,000.000 a
te ', I v
who has told us a single word
of the inote ch t is coming from this investment? Is i $100,000 a year? Are we noing
t lose 5900.000? Nobodv has told us. I say
that the man who comes to the Senate and
asks us to earnestly and honestly support a
proposal of this kind should have given some
figures to show what (the development is going
to earn and the conditions under which it is
going to be run.
Looking at the picture. I do not believe
that sufficient railroad tracks can be built
behind that work to do the raidlroad business
thant w>il1 be developed there if it develops as
a good many ipeople think it will. Take the
c'tv of Montreal. for instance. Ald who are

JUNE 18, 1925
familiar wi.th. the develoîpment ini the icity of
Montreal. know how wide the railroad traeks
are, and how far back they rua in order to
get .the gooe in land out. There is noe such
possibi'lity in this iciture, unilees you rua, out
into the St. La>wrenjce river; and, further,
there ia certainily no evidence befare this
flouse ta ýshow where we are going ta get
tha-t 'business.
My lionourable friend fro-m :New Brunswick
is quite entitied ita be sorry, and ta wish that
the deveïlopmenit of this port should relieve
the oondfition of 'the people of this country
tha-t was brouight about iby the railroad that
wias going ta bring relief to, Quebec and the
lower Provinces. But the trouble with that
railroad is that de voas onceived in sin and
develeped in iniquity, and it has not onle
chance in a million, whether ithese wharves
are 'buil.t or flot, of doifig any successfül
business or e!rnin-g money for the people of
Canada. I dannot 'think 'that the deveflepment of this port ds guing to deveilop business
that is goi.ng toe make that mailroad a suacees;
and because of this belle! and because we
have no -money to epeculate with, I -cannot
vote for this Bill.
Hon. SMEATON WITE: Honourahle
gentlemen, I wish to endorae everyth.ng thiat
the honourable gentleman froim Albma (Hon.
Mr. Fester) hias said with refereince to what
w-e in Montreal think about the iport o! Quebec. We are ald very proud of ft, and if this
scheme oould be carried through te the credit
of thnit city flnd that port, and aise to the
credit of Canada generail!Iy, nobody would be
more proud ýof it than the people of IMontreal.
I knew something about the port o! Quebec; 1 have viLsited it many tirnes; 'but 1 oannot see at the ipreseibt titme that there is any
ne-ed of this large expenditure, and on that
gound. hon-ourable gentlemen, I will oppose
the B;11. I think thftt anything that is necc-sa-ry and that is going to bring some return
must be considered iby us, even if we feel
that we do not want ta snake any large expenditure at the present time. But with
regard te !this partieular scheme, even the
people of Quebec cannot convince me ühat
thiere is any immediate need of building for
the future. For that veeon. I wilî o¶ppose the
Bill.
Hon, W. B. RiOISS Honourable gentlemen.
I just wish ta say a word befoire [ vote on
this BiJl. For years I have had hope thattihe
story that I had heard in miany quarters, that
it would be possible for Quebec 'te draw a
large tirade frein. the Northwest via the
Tranisetinental, would be borne eut by the
reaility. I feel somewhat like the honourable

571

memniber from Cape Breton, -that, if it wejre
poss'ble to bring .to Quebec the wheat anid
catle and other riches of 'the Nortvwest at
a lower figure by .thi.s ra.ilway than by iany
cwther system, it would. make a big trade for
Queibec ln the sujrnmer, and there would ýbe
perhaips .two or thiree mon-tha in -the winter,
on the close oýf navigaÀtion in Quebec, when St.
John or Halifax might have what was left
aver.
When this Bill was first mentioned to me,
I said that it wa.s a railway question. I still
say that it is a railway question. It seems
now that, for some reason or other which is
hard ta explain, it costs 15 cents a bushel ta
bring wheat from Edmonton ta Port Arthur,
a distance in round figures of 1,300 miles, while
fromt Armstrong ta Quebec, a distance of 900
odd miles, it costs 20j cents. Before I vote
for any expenditure at Quebec I want ta have
some assurance that the Transcontinental
railroad is not ta be abandoned. I am sorry
that this vote has came up in the way that it
has, because if 1 had any reasonable assurance
that fair play was ta be given tai Quebec
by the Transcontinental, I would be prepared
to vote for any reasonable expenditure asked
for by the transportation authorities ta take
care o! the trade at Quebec. But until there
is some explanation and some assurance as
ta how the railway is ta be handled fram
Quebec west, I do not feel like voting for
any further expenditure at that point.
Hon. N. CURRY: Honourable gentlemen,
I wish ta endorse what the three previaus
speakers have said. I used ta be a cantractor
myself, and bufit some wharves in Halifax,
and I know something about the cost of this
work. Within the last few minutes 1 have
seen a picture a! what is proposed in Quebec,
and I am quite satisfled that after the expenditure o! the $5,000,000 which it la proposed ta vote you will flot be ready ta dock
the first ship. We had that saine experience
in Halifax some years ago. We built terminais
there, and they are not flnished yet; and,
although somne $15,000,000 or $16,000,000 were
spent. there has been practically no use made
of thein. I believe you will have exactly the
samne experience in Quebec.
If Quebec were going ta attract tirade and
were going to get the trade hauled aver the
National Transcontinental railway, there
would have heen some evidence of it before
this. The railroad has been built for eight
years, but yau cannat get wheat buyers or
exporters ta use the facilitiez already there. I
have saîled from and landed at Quebec several
ti*mes in the lest tien years, and I have neyer
seen the berths that are there even one-

quarter filled. If this development is made,
I doubt very much if it ever would be used.
The ships would go on using the present
terminals, which are more convenient, as they
are doing in Halifax. As I said, $15,000,000
was spent at the south end of the harbour
there, and the steamers are still going up to
Nos. 1, 2, and 3 piers at the north end. I am
perfectly sure that any money that is spent
in Quebec will be absolutely thrown away,
and that if you go on and complete the whole
terminal there you will not get off with less
than $30,000,000.
Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlemen. I am as anxious as anybody in this
House to curtail expenditure as far as possible.
I must confess that at first I was somewhat
disturbed when this Bill was announced.
There is one question that weighs in my
mind. Can it be denied that the port of
Quebec is the natural port of the St. Lawrence,
that it is the best situated, and that it must
be the port of the future?
Hon. Mr. CURRY:
of Halifax.

The same can be said

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: No, because Halifax
hs far away. It is a port of another nature
altogether. For mv part, instead of being
jealous of Quebec, I have been disappointed
that the port of Quebec has not developed
to a greater extent than it has; but I have
no doubt at all-and I dare say that every
honourable mem:ber of this House feels the
same wa-that the port of Quebec cannot
for one moment be abandoned.
Hon. Mr. CURRY:
now.

It

has been up to

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Would the honourable
gentleman suggest that we should give up
the idea of the port of Quebec for all time?
Do we know what will be the condition of
navigition in five years? With everything
developing as it is, we cannot say at all what
will happen in the future.
I hive no practical knowledge of navigation
or of ports to enable me to form a proper
judgment by myself. but I have before me
the taitement of the Shipping Association,
which is a great Association. I cannot believe that that Association would give advice to the country which would be contrary
to the interests of Canada.
I understand from what has been read here
that this project is supported by the President
of the Canadian Pacifie Railway.
The
Canadian Pacific Railway is interested more
than any other company in the future of this
country.
H-n'm. Mi

CURRY.

Hon. Mr. CURRY: Is it not natural that
a steamship company or a railroad company
that can get extra facilities at no cost to
itself should be very glad indeed to have the
Government spend large sums of money to
make all sorts of conveniences for its benefit?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: My answer is that the
interests of the Canadian Pacifie Railway
Company are so interwoven with those of
the country that what is in the interest of the
country is in the interest of the Company;
and I am sure that there is no idea in the
mind of the President of the Canadian Pacifie
Railvay that would prevent him consulting
the interests of the country in a matter of
this kind rather than the immediate interests
of his Company.
So far as I am concerned, I view this question in the light of the fact that the port of
Quebrc is the natural port of the St. Lawrence river. The port of Montreal has become one of great importance. It is bound
to be continued and always to be a very
important port. because it is 180 miles further
inland than Quebec.
It is nearer to the
Western Provinces, and in that wav has an
advantage. But, I repeat, we do not know
what the conditions will be in the future, and
I ask whether we should expose ourselves to
the possibility of losing the benefit, mavbe
for 50 years or may"be forever, of the situation
of the port of Quebec? The trade of Quebec
is of sufficient importance to have attracted
large shipping companies from the Un'ited
States. That port has to be used as a supplement to the port of Montreal, and to what
extent it will be further used I do not know.
I think it is my, duty as a member of this
House to take the advice of the Shipping
Federation and of other parties who have
large interests at stake. and who are better
judges than I am of the matter. For these
reasons I propose to vote in favour of this
Bill.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable gentlemen, I cannot verv well understand why
at this stage more details than have been
given to the House are exacted. If I understand rightly, what we have to vote upon
is the second reading of the Bill. Whatever
my happen to the Bill afterwards, whatever
Committee it may be referred to. what we
have to determine now is the principle of
the Bill. It seems to me-I may be wrongthat we must consider only the principle of
the Bill, remembering that this measure, like
any other, b' following its natural course,
will bring to us the information which we may

JUNE 18, 1925
The question 'put to this House
require.
is whether we should or should nlot spend
$5,000,000.
0f course we are poor, and of course we
ought to retrench as rnuch as we can, but
there is a limit to that. Are we going to
plead poverty to every demand that cornes
before this flouse, and turn it down accordingly? Let me asic my honourable friend from
Assiniboia (Hon. Mr. Turriff) tio recollect what
his position was last year-we were poor then
aiso-when we were discussiog railway extensions, and when we were aAking for information, and getting seime that in rny opinion
was neot comparable to what we already have
in regard to this measure. Stili my honourable friend was insisting that we should spend.
and spend, and extend railways in that western
country, froun whidh we transport wheat; but,
even if we transport a great quantaty of
wheat, we are doubtful whether we make any
money with it at ail.
Now, what have we in support of the
principle of this Bill? I arn addressing myself to the business experience which this
flouse represents, and it would be difficuit
to find as good a jury for a 'business proposition such as this. The port of Montreal
was nlot always a paying port. It had its
troubles at first. It had to borrow from the
Dominion Governiment, and it was not sure
that it could honestly pay interest on the
But the Canadian
amounit s0 borrowed.
nation had faith in the port of Montreal,
and advanced the amount, and now we are
paying every cent of interest on the money
loaned to us fromn the treasury of Canada.
Well, why was the port of Montreel at that
time epecially a national port? Because it
was the extreme point of water penetration
in the country. Now, it is evident that that
point cd penietration is now changing--why?
Thirty years ago, when I went to Europe.
I took what 1 thought was a very big boat:
it was 5,000 tons, a very comfortable boat;
but 1 ask my colleagues, who among them
would now take a boat of 5,000 tons to cross
the ocean? We have now huge monsters
of 55,000 tons, and the passenger traffie practically exeludes ail boats which are nlot within the range of fromn 20,000 to 50,000 tons.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: Can a 55,000-ton boat
go up the St. Lawrence?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: It can go to Quebec.
Hlon. Mr. ROCHE: Do they go?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: No, but they are
increasing in tonnage ail the time. My hioncurable friend doe not need to smile; he

573

only needs to read history, and hie will have
his answer. Boats coming to the port of
Quebec have grown from 5,000 to 20,000 tons,
and who can say that within five or ten
years frorn now we shall not sec coming to
that port boats of frurn 30,000 tu 40.000 tons?
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: Does the honourable
gentleman know that the stearnship companies
are now abandoning the 50X000-ton boats,
and that they consider that those of 15,000
to 20,000 tons are the boats of the future?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Does my honourable friend want to give that as law to
the House?
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: I do.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Then I think rny
honourable frîend is wrong.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: I knew the boats when
they were 1,200 tons. The Cunard line
started with boats of 1,200 tons. There are
now only three of 55,000 tons, and they were
got frorn the Germans. There are no other
boats of that size.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Not the Olympie?
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: No; 46,000 tons is the
biggest boat now.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: What I want to
put to xny honourable friend is this. Supposing that we have now reached the limit
of tonnage of big boats, which have grown
until they are huge monsters, do you think
we are likely to go back to boats of less
than 25,000, 30,000 or 35,000 tons? 1 de'fy my
honouraible friend to demonstrate to this
flouse 'that any decent line doing a big
passenger trade now builds, passenger boats
of less than 20,000 tons. They do flot; they
make them over 30,000 tons. The French
line two years ago but the Paris, a boat of
36,000 tons. Now, take that as a limit. At
this stage, 'when we are only considering the
question of principle, before we ask for details,
are we going to deny to the river St. Lawrence
ail large passenger trade because, forsooth, it
muet be carried by big boats?
1 corne from, a city which is sornetirnes
supposed to have a sort of strange grudge
again8t Québec. It is flot true. I think we
are broad-xninded towards Quebec as we are
towards the Domiinion. I do not regard this
question as one that concerns only Quebec, or
only my province. It is a problem that con,cerne the w-hole Dominion. It seems to me
that is the way it shouid be treated.
How is t.his inatter presented tei you? The
witnewse you have had before you are heard
only on the principie of the Bill. You have,

574

SENATE

had the whole Shipping Federation. Forget
all the lines that belong to that organization,
and all the eminent men who direct them.
Forget also the Canadian National railways,
although nearly all the lines that we authorized in the West last year were built because
two of th ermployees of the Canadian National
came before us and assured us that they were
required, and we took their word for it. Now
we have the whole National Railway endorsing
this measure; but forget that. We have also
the Canadian Pacifie Railway endorsing it.
Forget that that company is the biggest transportation conpany in this country, but remember that it is our biggest taxpayer. But
forget that.
Now, if you want any personal, individual
testimony, free from any sort of party sympathy, hearken to the honourable member
from the Gulf (Hon. Mr. L'Espérance), a
man who bas shown his courage. ability and
honesty in the past. You beard him this
afternoon. If you were seeking amongst the
members of this House for the man best
qualified in every respect to give you testimnony on this matter, would vou not select
the man who was placed, not by this Governient, but by the preceding Government,
at the head of the port of Quebec? He has
for years studied the plans that you criticize
now as you see them rapidly and within a
few square inches on a sheet of paper. That
man though ont those plans years ago, followed their development for years. and had
hirmsef the responsibility of the administration of the port of Quebec. Could you find
a better witness? Would vou sav that he is
being carried away by symrnpathy? What did
he do last year? When a railway in the
province of Quebec was proposed, which was
.omg to cost us a million and a half, do you
remember that he said to the Government:
'I denounce that railway, because that expenliture is not justified." Did we hear any word
f that kind from the honourable centleman
'rom Assiniboia (Hon. Mr. Turriff)?
That
'ailwav was dropped because our honourable
'olleague had the courage to rise in his place,
cniiost a very strong current of feeling in his
Dyn province. and state that tfhat railwav was
not needed. The hononrable member for the
Gulf has studied all the possibilities of this
port, and the plans wbich are now submitted
to you, and he has corne before you and
pleaded in an admirable way for the principle
of this Bill.
For my part I regard this project as a great
national enterprise, realizing that if you stop
it you will stop the very life of Cana-da. I
consider this vote of money essential to enHon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

able Canada to overcome the handicap that
has been put upon her. It is active money;
it is useful money; it is money that will
produce the interest required to pay our
accumulated debt, and I am going to vote
for the Bill.
Hon. WM. ROCHE: Honourable gentlemen, I did not intend taking any part in this
debate. I voted for the dredging at Quebec
last year. and I will now vote for this measure. But some remarks have been made that
are rather disparaging to the port of Halifax
and I want to say that if there is any
national port in Canada, it is the triple port
of Halifax, 15 miles long, with a depth of 70
feet of water.
I have seen all the ships that the honourable gentleman speaks of, the very best of
them--the Olympie-at the railway wharf in
Halifax, the wharf next to my own. I have
seen the largest ships that are on the Atlantic,
with the exception of the German boats, and a
good many of them; so I may say without any
reservation that the port of Halifax during the
war saved the British Empire. In the basin
of Halifax there were collected at times 100
ships in a convoy, and if those ships were not
colected in the port of Halifax the British
Emnire would have succumbed in the war.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: What is the matter
with St. John, New Brunswick?
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: St. John is sometimes
there, sometimes not. I do not want to
disparage any port whatever; but when any
comparison is instituted between places, one
being called exclusively a national port, I
say that the port that deserves that title is
Halifax.
We have at present facilities in
Halifax to accommodate the largest ships, and
:,l of them. When the Olympie came in,
the captain wanted the harbour cleared out,
but when ho got in he found there would be
room for 100 more ships like his own in one
o? the harbours.
If the worst enemy of Halifax could have
come there and selected the place to put
those south terminas, he would have put them
just where the Borden Government put them
-the most exposed place in Halifax, with a
shoal outside of it. and no water inside.
Verv fortunaltely there were already in existence the deep water terminals, which could
accommodate the largest ships, and at those
places any vessel that wished to communicate
witih Halifax. or obtain any stores or goods,
or land anything, could find accommodation.
I want to say that there will be no vessels
carrving grain exclusively of 40,000 tons or
more. I know, frorn intimate knowledge of
the captains and owners of the Atlantie lines,

JUNE 18, 1925
that thiey consider those very large ships
whbeh were taken from the GeTmans--2he
Majestic, the Imperator and the other one,
the three being about the same size-merely as
show ships, whîch are kept by the big New
York limes as advertisements. They do not
pay, the lines depending upon the smal.ler
ships to earn the money to support the coinpanieýs, and also to support those big ships.
Let us take a concrete case. The other day
at an examination before a Committee, some
agents of the lines running into Quebec and
Montreal stated that they lost £3,000 on
every trip, because the vessels were too large
for the trade. 1 do flot want to say a word
to disparage the port of Quebec or the port
of Montreal. There is room in Canada for al
our ports, but I do flot like to hear any person
applying the term "national port" to a place
100 and 200 miles up a river, or to another
place up a river that is closed in winter and
noV available ail the year round, when the port
of Halifax could take themn all in ail the
turne.
Hon. E. D. SMITH: I want to say just a
word on the principle of this Bill, by which
35.00,000 is to be spent almost immediately.

Now, I will not take second place to anyone in my desire Vo secure the hast facilities

people think that because a man lives in the
central part of the Dominion he has no inerest outside of that; but I can assure bonourable gentlemen wbo live in the Province of
Quebec that not one of thbem, bas more desire to, see the s1ýipping fadilities in the
cities of Quebec and Montreal made good
and efficient, and ample for the trade of this
Dominion, than those who live in the central
part, because their living is made by the

our -ports. I have no objection to, making

immigrants is s, saal as comçpared with what
we had before -the war.
Wbeat is one of the great exports of Canada. At Quebec we have an elevator holding
2.000,000 hushels and capable, as the honourable member from Assiniboia (Hon. Mr.
Turriff) says, od hsandlimg 10,000,000 buahels a
vear, and ît bas handled in one year, at the
utmost, I believe, 5,000,000 bushels. I have
myseif often wondered wby it did mot receive
a larger quantity of wleat. We aIl remember
that, wben the Transcontinental railway was
promoyted and huirit, it was stateid tha-t the
rcad was going to be bui'lt in such a first-class
manner and with such easy grades that wheat
could be hauled fnom the West ito the port of
Queibre as cbeaply as it could be transported
by liake and rail. But tbat bas not heen the
case. I do not know why. I have otften wondeored why. It wias stated at the, time the rooad
wýas built thàt a -rate of 6 cents would be
adompted. At thaît rate Quebec would und-oubtedly be so congested that it wourld be
neeessary bo bave five or six ele'vators tbere.

therefore I assume VbaV it woulid be unprofitable to reduce Vbem. Until those rates are

S1ZNATE

When 'there is congestion at that port-and
I hope that time wilil corne soon-I shall be
one of the verv first to vote all the money
that is ne'eded f.or the ful equi,pment of Queber harbour. We want to have Quebec well
equipped, and Montreal well equipped, and
the Maritiiime Province ports, and Vancouver;
and I will take second place to nobody in
urging that this Government vote sufficient
.money to provide adequiate facilities for the
handling 'of alil the traffic that is likely to go
to a'ny of those ports. But I think 'tha.t at
the present juncture. honourable gentlemen,
in view of the condition of our finances, and
inasmuch as the immediate need bas not been
shown. we can afford te wait. There will be
time enough when the congestion occurs. Then
the necessary facilities can be provided quickly-not in five years, but in one year. A
sufficient amount can be provided at any
time, on a year's notice, to take ýcare of increased traffic.
Therefore I shall be obliged, much against
my inclinations in some respects, to vote
against this measure. It is against my inclinations because it will no doubt be said by some
that we are parochial-that members from
Quebec vote for this measure, but that members from other parts of the country do not
vote for it. That is not at all my attitude.
As I said before, nobody wouid vote more
readily for money to develop these ports than
I would if I thought the expenditure necessary.
Hon. R. DA'NDURAND: Honourable gentlemen, I will answer a few questions that
have been put to me; and I will start by
informing my honourable friend that while
he bas set up certain reasons for the increased accommodation at Quebec and bas
not found them strong enouglh to decide him
to support the Bill, he bas forgotten that
there is an authority which ought not to be
treated with contempt, and which represents
977,799 gross tons of ocean and cost shipping
trading to the St. Lawrence. That is a considerable factor, and I would like to compare
it with the total tonnage coming and going
on the St. Lawrence. I refer to the Shipping
Federation. Are they not most vitally interested? Are they not the users of the route?
They should know something about it. They
are located in Montreal, and ail their interests are centralized there. They say:
Wherefore your Memorialists are of the opinion that
an appropriation should be granted to the Quebec
Harbour Commissioners to enable them to commence
ths national work as it may be pointed out that the
matter is urgent when it is considered that it will take
five years before any of the additionai berths can be
prcvided for the use of ocean traffic.

My
certain reasons which to him did not seem
to establish the urgency of this measure; but
he bas not touched upon that very important
pronouncement by the big interests which are
intimately, essentially connected with the
question of transportation facilities in the
ports of Montreal and Quebec. That is the
answer to my honourable friend.
I have been asked by my honourable friend
from Middleton (Hon. W. B. Ross): "Will
you assure me that the railway freight ratewill be be so revised as to give the Transcontinental business which would feed and
over-feed the port of Quebec?" My honourable friend knows that there it a Bill now on
its way to this Chamber which gives the Railway Commission the riLht to fix railway rates
over the whole Dominiýon of Canada, in order
that the rates may be equalized.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Except as
to grain and flour.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes. As to grain
and flour a maximum is fixed for a certain
mileage across the three Prairie Provinces.
From that it may be argued that the same
mileage rates should be applied eastward. If
they were, you would have a solution of the
difficulty of my honuorable friend from
Middleton and a complete answer to his question.
I have been asked-I believe by my honourable friend from Alma (Hon. G. G. Feoster)if I can guarantee him that there will be
I

answer, in all sincerity, that I cannot give
th.t guarantee. I cannot give it for tomorrow, nor for the day after to-morrow.
But we are putting to ourselves the question,
what must be done to equip our ports on the
St. Lawrence? We asked ourselves a similar
question when we were considering the equipment of the ports of Vancouver, Fort William
and Port Arthur, Halifax and St. John, and
on those occasions nobody could rise in bis
place and declare that the proposed expenditure would be productive. While a certain
expenditure may not be immediately productive, it may be, and it often is,

future will take care of itself. But I am
convinced that, under the conditions as we
have them to-day, the ports of Montreal and
Quebec constitute one and the same proposition.
I repeat what has been stated by the honourable gentleman from De Salaberry (Hon.
MIr. Béique), that conditions are so shaping
themselves as to link the fate of Quebec with

freight rate from Armstrong to Quebec, and
I do net see how my honourable friend can

from Middleton, telling him that the Railway Commission is empowered, under the

and Quebec, with increases of 20, 9 and 2 respectively.
Saskatchewan, Manitoba, New Brunswick and British
Columbia recorded respective decreases of 13, 4, 4, and
3. In addition to the actual increases or decreases by
provinces, attention may also be drawn to the larger
number of decrees granted to wives in Nova Sceotia,
Manitoba and Alberta, to husbands in Nova Scotia
and Alberta and to the smaller number granted to husbands in Manitoba and to wives in Saskatchewan, (Ses
Table 2).

on desertion are granted to wives. In the United States,
however, 40 per cent of the divorces granted to wives
are on grounds of cruelty, while 44 per cent of those
to husbands are on grounds of desertion. In the latter
country, as in New Zealand, a correspondingly larger
proportion of decrees are granted to husbands on
grounds f adultery than to wives).
Divorces Granted in United States to Persons Married
te CanadaA fact which throws considerable new light on the
divorce situation in Canada is found in the Marriage
and Divorce Bulletin of the United States Bureau of
the Census. The statistics of this publication indicate
the surprisingly large extent to which divorces are
granted in that country to persons married in Canada.
Thus, in 1922, no fewer than 1,368 divorce decrees were
granted to couples married in Canada, a number more
diao 2k times as large as the total number granted
in Canada in the same year. This number also formed
36.2 per cent of the number of divorces granted in
United States during the year to couples married in
foreign countries, while, at the same time, the perceetage of the Canadian-born population to the total
foreign-born amounted to only 8.1 per cent. The Bulletin ges on to say: "It is possible that many Canadians
equire a residence in the United States for the sole
purpose of obtaining divorce because in general, divorce
laws are more liberal in the United States than in
Canada." Of the 1,368 divorces granted to couples who
had been married in Canada, no fewer than 462 were
granted by the courts of the State of Michigan, whi!e
135 were granted in the State of Washington and 128
in California.

The Sex of Applicants for DivorcesIt will be seen that, in the common division of
divorce statistcs into those granted to husbands and to
wives, the 1924 figures indicate a change from the
precedmg year. In 1922 and 1923, divorces granted to
husbands i0 Canada formed respectively 58 and 53.5
per cent of the total number granted. In 1924, however, this percentage dropped to 48.8 per cent. The
change in relative proportions is very prdbably to be
accounted for by the recent demand for equal rights
for either sex in divorce proceedings. In comparing
Canadian divorces in this respect with those in New
Zealand and m the United States, it is seen that the
decrees granted in New Zealand are also distributed
practically evenly between the sexes, while in the
United States, snce 1889, the proportion between decrees granted to husbands and to wives bas been approximately 1 to 2 respectively.
(A possible indication of the grounds of petitions and
decrees may be had from statistics of divorce in New
Zealand, where a preponderance of divorces are granted
to husbands on grounds of adulltery and separation,
while a corresponding preponderance of decrees based

In Table 3 are added comparative figures of divorces
and marrnages in England and Wales, Australia, New
Ze.land and Canada for the years 1916 te 1922 or 1923.
The percentage of divorces te marriages, taking place in
the samne year, as here given, is seen

England and Wales te have increased during eight
vears from 0.35 per cent te 0.91 per cent; in Australia
fromi 1.53 per cent te 2.81 per cent;

in New Zealand

from 2.41 per cent to 5.20 per cent and in Canada froin
0.1 per cent to 0.8 per cent. Similar figures for the
United States, where, of course, the total numnber of
divorces is unusually large owing to the comparative

ease with which they may be obtained, show increases
from 27,919

in 1887 to 42,937 in

112,036 in 1916 and 148,815 in 1922.

ROUYN BRANCH LINE
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. BLONDIN inquired of the Government:
1.Are there presently negotiations engaged between
the imaniagement of the Canadian National Railway and
the Province of Quebee with reference te the construetion of a branch line from a point at or near
O'Brien to the Township of Rouyn in the Province of
Qielec?
2. If se, to what extent have these negotiations progre-sed and by what special authority are such negotiations being conducted by the management of the
Canadian National Railway and the Government of the
Province of Quebec?

Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gentlemen, I am advised by the Department
of Railways and Canals that a private company has secured a charter from the Quebec
Legislature for the construction of a line
of railway between the mining district of
Rouyn and the National Transcontinental
Railway. The railway in question is to be
constructed by this company, and under the
Railway Act it is competent for the Canadian
National Railway Company, with the approval of the Governor in Council, to lease
such a line on terms to be decided upon.
Hon. Mr. GORDON inquired of the Government:
1. Has the Board of the Canadian National Railway
entered into an agreement with the Rouyn Mines Railway Comipany or any other railway company or are
ther negotiating an agreement with any company in
te ect to (a) the construction of railway lices; (b)
leasing of lices, or (c) the operation of lines, in the
Iouyn Mining District. Province of Quebec.

Hon.

Mr.

WILLOUGHBY.

2. If so. (a) what proposed lines areý considered ; (b)
whaot is the nature of the agreement?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
1. (a) No.
(b) No.
(c) No.

2. Answered by No. 1.
PRIVATE BILL
REMISSION OF PARLIAMENTARY FEES

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved:
That the Parliamentary fees paid upon the Bill W3,
intituled: "An Act to change the name of 'The Dominioa Woman's Christian Temperance Union' to 'Canadian Woman's Christian Temnperance Union'," be re-

funded to the petitioners, less printing charges.

Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I would ask the
honourable member who is making this motion
to give us an explanation. On the face of it,
it is a little difficult to see why this particular
institution should have its fees refunded any
more than any other private institution. There
are in this country a great many people who
do not agree with the principles of this
particular organization, and I would like to
know what is the situation with regard to it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: In reply to the
question raised by my honourable friend from
Vancouver, I may say that I believe it to be
a well-established practice in this House to
refund fees when the organization concerned
is not one conducted for profit.

This is a

purely philanthropie undertaking by people
who have certain views on the question of

when it is done it is hoped by the Harbour
Commissioners of Quebec that frteight will
corne in such quantites that Parliarnent will
insist upon their going on and developing
their scherne. Surely my honourable friend
would flot want the port to stop there.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, no,
flot for a moment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I give my
honourable friend the general plan.
.Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It seems
to me the Government must have given some
serious consideration to what will be the
ultirnate scherne. They are flot entering
lightlv, I apprehend, upon an expenditure of
$5,O0o,000 on a seherne of this kind without
taking into consideration its application to
the general scherne. There are two things I
should like to know: one is whether this will
carry out a complete unit in itself, not dependent on any other work.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: So I arn inforrned. When this $5,.0O00 is expended on
the work as projected and described, it will he
complete in it.self. There will be wharves,
sheds, and railway tracks joining the Canadian
Pacifie and the Canadian National to this
water frontage.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: N->ot depcnding upon any other wurk?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, it will
estand cornplete by itself.
Hon. Sir' JAMES LOUGHEED: Secondly,
cmi my honourable fricnd give me an
approxirnate idea-I presumne that is ail thal
can be given-of what the cost of the entirE
-.chcme wvill be, assurning that evcrything goeý
lovely and that ail expectations are met, and
that these enorrnous boats will corne down
the St. Lawrence according to the expectations
that my honourable friend frorn Montarville
cxpressed ycsterday.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My answer is
that this plan projects a development that,
according to the needs, may take 25 ycars
to develop. The figuring as to the cost of
the various steps that will need to be taken
has not yet been done; it must be consîderable; but, as my honourable friend well
knows, it will not require much to force this
work upon the Harbour Cornmission if there
is the least hope of a fair freight rate from
Armstrong to Quebec.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That can
be fixed to-morrow.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That may be
fixed to-morrow. In the meantirne we will
take this step with the knowledge that we
are adding a self-contained work sufficient to
maintain itself and develop the port of
Quebec for the next five or ten years.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: So far as
frcight rates from Arrnstrong to Quebec are
concerned, you already have faciIities to rneet
the requirernents of the trade.
Hon. Mr. CURRY: May I ask how rnany
ships the proposed devcloprnent will accommodate?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
This will provide accommodation for six ilarge ocean ships,
in addition to what we have already got. It
will provide for six more ierths.
Hon. Mr. 'GORDON: Arn I righ't in assumin-g that -the great necessity for this is
to ena;ble ships of very large capacity to
come in?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Yes.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I have iaeen led to
believe &rom some of the evidence given
hefore the Ocean Rates Committee that the
tendency is to use ýships of smaller capaci.ty,
particularly for freight-ships of about 10,000
tons. I understand that it is now considered
that such ships can be operated more cheapdy
than larger boats. That, I understand, is the
reason the late Sir William Petersen gave for
intending to use boats of that capacity.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I understand from
the explanations made hy the leader of the
Government that this new work is being
started lýargely for the puapose of carrying
wheat.
Hon. Mr. DANDU1RAND:
No, it is not:

Hon. Mr. TURRIFE:
My honouraible
friend holds out the hope that by means of
lower rates wheat will be brought down to
Quebec from Armstrong. That certainly would
accornplish a great deal; but my honourable
frîend knows that the Minister of Railways
in the Government of which my honourable
friend is an ornament, does not propose te
do that, and says, "Why should we do it?"
To a certain extent he is righ-t in believing
that wheat can neyer be brought, that distance
by rail unless they go back te the old rates,
which they have no intention of doing. As

far as I can see, the accommodation at Quebec
is now sufficient for the big passenger ships
There are seven berths there now ta accommodate those boats, and there is no prospect
of a large amount of freight coming down on
the Transcontinental owing to cheaper rates.

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Did I not understand the honourable gentleman to say that
there was some hope that the harbour of
Quebec would succeed in getting very large
grain shipments fram the West?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No. I simply
answered an argument which oame from some
honourable gentleman, that if this question
of rates were settled favourably to the port
of Quebec, it would add enormously; but it
is not one of the factors that enter into the
present proposal.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
The honourable
gentleman has, I think, no hope in that
regard.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
We discussed
that yesterday, my honourable friend and I.
My only hope is based on the fact that there
is a Bill, which may be now before us, empowering the Railway Commission to fix rates,
and that in that Bill there are directions to
the Railway Commissioners to equalize the
rates. Something may resuit which will be
favourable to the port of Quebec, but I do
rot know.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Was not that the
situation prier to the passing of this last
Act? Did not the Railway Commission have
the right to fix the rate? The only reason I
am asking this is that I would not like any
honourable gentleman to indulge in a hope
which, so far as I can see, is not likely to be
realized. I am one of those who are extremely anxious to sec grain go down to the
port of Quebec, because it would be of great
benefit to the West, and if grain could be
shipped from Winnipeg at a lower rate, it
would solve some of the problerns with which
we are now struggling.
lon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will my honourable friend allow me to put to him a
question? Here is something that I cannot

understand. My honourable friend says that
a lower rate from Winnipeg to Quebec would
be very favourable to the West.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If that is so,
why does not the West see that its grain is
sent through Quebec and that favourable
rates are granted? I understand that the West
has shown complete indifference to the use of
the Transcontinental?
No, no; it is

hands of the producer he has no more control
over it. Nor is it controlled by even the
crdinary grain-buyer in Winnipeg. The control is limited to exporting houses.
Hon. Mr. DANDTURAND: I feel convinced
that if the West considered it advantageous
to the producer to send wheat by that short
route, we would hear some noise around these
Parliament buildings.
If the honourahie
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:

plenty of noise about these freight rates. The
question is agitating all the Boards of Trade
in the cities, towns and villages of the West.

are being made every day, about the railroad rates in tihe West.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No. I answered
that part of my honourable friend's question
at the beginning. I said there was no intention whatever to build an elevator at the
tresent time.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Then it is obviously the intention te maintain the present
harbour facilities in the St. Charles basin.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My honourable
friend, I think, two years ago came before
this House with a request for a substantial
vote, which he obtained, for the purpose of
improving and enlarging the harbour as
existing at that time. May I ask now for the
information that I had hoped to get yesterday?
May I ask the honourable gentleman just
why it is tihat the harbour development in the
St. Charles basin, that is, on the Beauport
side of the harbour. which, as we know, is
no' one-third ccmpleted, is not touched at
al. A thousand acres of land could easily
be made available there by the dredging of the
harbour and the building of a revetment
wall. Why is it that that harbour development is being abaandoned, when it is obviously
going to be necessary to continue to maintain
that harbour as well as the new one?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The plan of
developmont at that place has been abandoned
becait-e it has been found that it would cost
more money te develop tha part of the port
tian te prooced with the present scheme, and
it would be far less satisfactory, because of the
sands that are doposited every time the tide
comes in, and especially when certain winds
are blowing. The northeast winds of Quebec
are famous throughout the province. Experiene has demonstrated that it would be more
cos ly to build and more costly te maintain.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Honourable gentlemen, if it were possible te transport grain
over the Transcontinental te Quebec, I am
sure that a vote of this amount, or a very
much larger one, would pass this House in
very few minutes; but it seems te me it is
only playing with words and with the matter
at stake for any person te say that grain can
be economically brought from the West te
Quebec over the Transcontinental, in view
of the evidence which we had last year on the
subjec- of rates, vhich the Canadian National
claimed were 50 per cent lower than American
rates qnd on which it had lost over $5,000,000.
If a propor:ionate rate were given on grain

Mr. DANDURAND.

imagined for a moment that it is ever going
te bc possible te transport grain economically
by that route.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Of course, I
have no desire te limit the discussion of this
Bill at the present stage, but we discussed
these questions on the second reading. I
stated then, and I repeat, that the possibility
of wheat shipments going via Quebec bas net
been a factor in determining the Government
te present these proposals. They are based
on the fact that we are at present confronted
with the problem of arranging facilities for
the upper St. Lawrence ports, Quebec and
Montreal, whose interests are at present linked
together, because of the fact that large vessels must stop at Quebec, and the water
level at certain seasons has gradually lowered
te such an extent that steamers of 27-foot
draft have been obliged te lighten their cargoes at Montreal and take on their complement at Quebec. This difficulty may be
attributed te the diversion of water at Chicago and te other causes.
The Shippin
Federation have felt that it was the proper
thing te equip the port of Quebec, in view
of the present emergency, and the fact that
the accommodation at Quebec is sometimes
used te its full capacity. This scheme will
take five years te complete, and should be
started now, and the Shipping Federation
have declared it te be most urgent.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I desire te ask the
honourable gentleman just one question, and
I will not trouble him further. Do I understand the situation te bc this? There is a
harbour now fully equipped with elevators.
and there is te bc a new harbour started
somewhere else. The work is to be commenced this year, and the expenditure of
money is to be continued, and then the old
harbour will be abandoned, te all intents
and purposes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
What old harbour? No; the old harbour is not te bc
abandoned.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I mean, it will be
te a certain extent, because if you are te keep
on spending up te $30,000,000 on a new harbour, the old one will bc out of date. It is
built in the wrong place.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But my honourable friend must not forget that these
developments will only go on as they become
necessary.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: But is it a fact that
the pre-ent harbour bas been built at the
wrong place?

velopments around the St. Charles river have
been in progress for the last 30 or 40 years.
It is not a question of yesterday; it is a
matter of long tradition. According to the
capacity of the ships, it seemed to be the
proper place for the development of the
port; but conditions have changed completely,
and it is now felt, on account of the large
draft vessels, it should be developed at the
place shown on the map.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Most of the points have been taken up with
the exception of this; whether it is feasible
to get accommodation for railway tracks and
the transfer of freight at the place projected
along the river bank, with its narrow margin
between the cliffs and the river. L have heard
that question raised as an argument for wider
spaces, as against the present proposition.
My answer is
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
that from the projected wall to the foot of
the cliff is a distance of over 700 feet, which
is a larger space than the width of the Montreal wharves.
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: I think I
might add that these plans have been
thoroughly examined and gone into by the
president of the C.P.R. and the C.N.R., and
before they gave their endorsement to them
they must have consulted their engineers.
We would not expect Mr. Beatty pr Sir Henry
Thornton to approve of such plans without
doing so. The Shipping Federation thought
there was need for further development, and
they considered these plans the best that coul'd
be devised.
The Federation says that not
only are the works needed, but they are
urgent, as a national necessity.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
My understanding was that the Shipping
Federation made its plea on the condition

that the state would finance the expenditure;
but I have not been able to gather, either
from Sir Henry Thornton's letter or from that
of the president of the C.P.R. that they are
very greatly enamoured of or are pressing for
this projected improvement.
They do
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE:
approve of it.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
They say they will co-operate if it is made,
but they are not nearly seo definite as the
Shipping Federation on that point.
Now, I want to go to another point. My
honourable friend does not throw me off my
pins by referring me to the opinion of

know the useless expenditures that have been
put on this country by engineers? Take the
very subject we are discussing to-day: how
often during many years, have I had it dinned
into my cars that the best place for the
development of Quebec was the St. Charles
river, with its fresh water, no barnacles, plenty
of room on each side, the winds blowing in
and out, and always keeping things clearThat was surely the proper place for the improvement. Every one of your engineers in
all those years examined it, slept over it, incubated, and came to the conclusion that that
was the place where the improvements ought
to be made. Yet the very three elements
which have knocked out their conclusion have
not been brought about in later times: there
was the river with its silt; there was the
breeze or storm from the ocean to drive it
back, and there was the water which was the

there, and yet you have those engineersHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Working
in favour of the dredging contractor.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Yes, and you have the engineers through all
those years cocksure that that was the place;
and there is where we put our money. Now,
have the engineers been reorganized within
the last two or three years? I do not think
the present engineers are any more sturdy
than their predecessors. Are they infallible
to-day? They come down and say: "All our
predecessors were wrong: that is the wrong
place; we never can carry on there; this is
the proper place for it;" and they give their
conclusions, and we are asked to accept them
holus bolus, and to launch our heavy expenditures on them.
I am troubled and tormented with doubts
that the present race of engineers is not
a whit wiser than their predecessors, and that
they may be taking us into an expenditure

SENATE
of which their successors five or ten years
hence will say: " Oh, no. they were quite
wrong." That is what is troubling me. If
we only had an authenticated Biblical set
of engineers, who, when they made their
conclusions, made them as infallible as the
Pope makes his decrees, then I would go on
with a lighter heart.
Nýow, what is the use of our playing around
that grain business? My honourable friend
knows in his heart that Quebec can never
under present geographical conditions, which
will not change in his time or mineHon. Mr. DANDURAND: I did not raise
that question; !I was simply answering a
query; I was asked in plain terms if I thought
the routes would be altered, and I had to
answer.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
My honourable friend must know that there
is no clear prospect at all of grain being
carried by that route and of Quebec competing with other ports. So you are not making this expenditure in the hope of getting a
large grain trade that you could not otherwise get?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

No.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Then you are making an expenditure of $5,000.000 for what purpose? Taking present
facilities, is there sufflicient prospect of adding trade to make it possible for us with a
clear conscience to undertake $5,000,000 of new
expenditure? That is the point that começ
to me, and I have to decide that before 1
can say whether I will vote for this or whethei
I will have to vote against it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My honourable friend voted against it yesterday, so that
his conscience need not trouble him.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I do not know; I trailed with me a sturdy
adherent of my honourable friend to minister to his intellectual instruction, but I
have no recollection of voting either one way
or the other.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: When he took
away a supporter of the scheme he was voting.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I suppose that if I had thought about it I
wouid have come to the conclusion that my
honourable friend opposite would have voted
for the scheme.
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: I made this
matter as clear yesterday as I could, according to the way I see it. I am going to anHon. Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

swer the remarks of the junior member for
Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster),
with regard to mistakes that he claims have
been made by engineers.
When Sir William Price, the first Chairman
of the Quebec Harbour Commission after the
reorganization in 1912-13, took charge of that
port, there was practically nothing but a
breakwater and a basin; there were no facilities for large draft vessels. He got the best
engineers he could get from Montreal and
Quebec. The chief engineer of the port of
Quebec at that time, Mr. Boswell, was one
of the most competent engineers, I think,
that ever passed through Canada, having had
a very long experience with ports. Then he
got the firm of Messrs. Coode, Matthews,
Fitzmaurice & Wilson, of London, who sent
two of their members to inquire as to the
best way of developing and equipping the
port of Quebec. After looking at the works,
they decided that the best place to develop
the port of Quebec would be exactly where
the-se improvements are to be made. I have
read their report many times.
Those engineers said: "You have certain works there,
and have spent considerable sums of money
already; we think that, until the port of
Quebec develops to a Jarge extent through
the traffic it will get. it would be best for
vou to start the development here." At that
time it was not realized that the big boats
would have to stop at Quebec. There were
very few boats that were over 25 feet draft,
and we did not realize that so many large
boats would in the next decade have to
make Quebec their terminal. It was believed
that Montreal would get all the large vessels
as well as the small ones. The engineers
toid us "You can either complete the basin
in the St. Charles river towards Beauport,
and continue your work, or you can go back
to the other scheme and develop further at
Wolfe's Cove." That is what is done today. At that time we had a big plan to
dam the River St. Charies, a work that was
to cost $3,000,000 or $4,000,000, on which we
spent $1,000,000, and then stopped it on account of the war. Surely you are not going
to spend $4.000,000 in damming the river St.
Charles, and then continue the development
of the port, for that would double and treble
the expense. There bas been no mistake of
engineers: we are doing exactly what they
recommended in 1912 and 1913.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF:
I think we have
heard enough of excuse for this expenditure
on the ground that the C.P.R., the C.N.R.
and the Shipping Federation favour the
scheme. Why would they not favour it? It
is not going to cost them anything, and

JUNE 19, 1925
naturally they approve of it. However, this
afternoon the atmosphere has been somewhat cleared, and I understand my honourable friend the leader of the Government to
make the statement that this expenditure is
proposed to accommodate the large ships that
bring in our immigrants.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend is in error; I did not say that.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: That is what I
understood my honourable friend to say. At
all events, we are bringing in 100,000 people
a year, and chiefly transferring them to the
United States. 'If we expend even $5,000,000
on this new work, the interest at 5 per cent
on. that amount would be $250,000 annually,
which would be $2.50 for every head of immigration. Now, that is a lot of money to
spend. The boats carrying immigrants come
to Quebec now; I have been there and have
seen them discharge. It seems to me there
has been no justification brought forward
for the tremendous amount of money demanded, for there is no doubt that when the
work is done and the $5,000,000 expended,
the improvements will not be completed.
Section 2 was agreed to.
On section 3-interest on debentures during
construction to be charged to capital account:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Could my
honourable friend give us some idea of what
the revenues of this port will be? We are
making particular provision for the payment
of interest on the debentures, and that implies
that the interest will be paid.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
What are the
facts in regard to St. John, Fort William
and Port Arthur?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I do not
know about those places, but I understand
that we have spent about $12,000,000 in Quebec, and that there is due in interest about
$8,000,000. What are the additional hopes
my honourable friend may have as to the
payment o! interest on this expenditure?
That question
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
was asked last evening and I answered that
I could not say. I stated that there were
two kinds of ports in Canada: those administered by Commissions for the state, and
others administered by the state direct,
through the Department of Public Works.
Those that have the advantage of. being
administered direct by the Department have
no interest charged against them, because
it is a gift; but when a port has a Commission, bookkeeping starts, and interest is

591

charged, but the result is the same in both
cases.
These are public works that must be carried
on by the state. It is incumbent on the
state to equip the ports according to the
needs of to-day and to-morrow. I hope that
my honourable friend and I will live long
enough to go to the city of Quebec and
gaze upon that port and say: "Well, we did
right in developing this port; look at the
splendid array of ships that are frequenting
it."1
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May I
ask my honourable friend if it is the intention
of the Government to take the interest out
of the principle? I see that provision is made
in line 29 that:
The said interest may be paid out of the said sum
of five million dollars.

It seems to me that that is a very satisfactory way of securing the interest, and I
direct the attention of the Government to
this, so that they will not overlook it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I must tell
my honourable friend that that is a standard
clause.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I would like to ask
my honourable friend if the 'Government has
any money to loan to individuals on the same
basis?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I think so;
wherever there is a necessity, the state will
do its part.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Will the $5,000,000 complete the whole business, and also pay the interest during the
five years, or will there be an additional vote
in order to recoup the country for the payment of interest?
If fate wills
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
that I shall be in this seat in five years, I
shall then be able to answer my honourable
friend.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I think that is about as certain as my honourable friend usually is.
Section 3 was agreed to.
On section 4-plans, etc., to be approved
before work is commenced:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I wish to
refer to a matter which perhaps should have
been brought up under section 2. There is a
policy involved in these Harbour Bills, to
which I have taken exception in former years;
that is, handing money over to a Commission
to carry out the works entirely upon their

SENATE
own responsibility.
I am not casting any
reflection upon the Harbour Commission of
Quebec, but it seems to me an anomaly that
the Public Works Department should hand
over a very large sum of money, from which
they have no expectation of receiving any
return, to an extraneous body, placing the
responsibility entirely on that irresponsible
body to carry out great public works. When
I say an irresponsible body, I do not intend
to cast any reflection upon the personnel of
this Harbour Commission; but they are responsible to no one except the Government.
Now, the Government is responsible to Parliament for the expenditure of publie money,
and it seems to me that we are entirely setting aside a principle which is fundamental,
namely, that of the Government being responsible te Parliament for such expenditure,
and are introducing an autocratie or bureaucratic policy in supercession of that which we
know by .experience to be very desirable. May
I ask my honourable friend what attention is
being given to the checking of the expenditurcs which are to be so made?
Hon. M\f DANDURAND:
r.
The expenditurcs are being checked by the Department
and by the Auditor General. We have even
given power to the Audit Board to examine
into the works and the finances of every port
in Canada, be they under Commission or
directly under the Publie Works Department.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:

CANTEEN FUNDS BILL
REPORT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE

The Senate proceeded to the consideration of the Report of the Special Committee
tu whom was referred Bill 32, an Act respecting the disposal of the Canteen Funds.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Honourable gentlemen, the matters covered by this and the
following reports took a great deal of the
time of the Committee to which they were refrredi. If I were to attempt to go into details. I am afraid I would occupy a long time.
and at this stage, and because the matters
oialt with are perhaps not of primary importance, may I ask leave to make my observations as brief as possible?
As honourable gentlemen who have read the
reports hiave seen. there were three matters
outside of the Bills which we were asked to
investigate and to report upon. One of these
had to do with what is called the Canteen
Fund, another with what is called the Disablement Fund, and the 'other with the question of the sale of poppies.
Dealing first with the Canteen Fund, I
may say that this Fond, which anounts to
$2.300,000, is a sum of monev which bas been
paid by the Imperial Government to the
Government of Canada, and whichl is now
lying in the hands of the Receiver General
as part of the profits which were earned during the war by the canteen. I forget the
total amount of the profit realized in the
whole of the British forces. but the Imperial
Government deicded that the amount I have
mentioned was our share. As I have said,
has been received and is now in our
tht
hands. It is dealt with in a complete way
by Bill 32, as to which I shall have a word
te sav later on.
Now, out of this $2,300,000, there were paid
to the Dominion Commnand of the Great War
Vcterans' Association the following sums:
First, $20.000; then, on the lst of August,
1921, $10,000; on the 1st of September, 1921,
$10.000; on the 1st October, 1921, $10,000;
on the 17th of October a further $10,000;
on the 1st of November, 1921, $60.000; and on
the 13th of December, 1921, $10,000. Yen will
therefore sec, honourable gentlemen, that the
anount paid to the Aso-ciation in less than six
nonths was $130,000.
This money was paid over to the Great
War Veterans' Association for the purpose of
extending the scope and usefulness of that
Association. Perhaps I should have said at
once that besides the G.W.V.A. there were
the Dominion Alliance, the Army and Navy

·

JUNE 19, 1925
Veterans, and seven or eight other orzanizations, the names of which I cannot remember
at the moment, which were ministering to the
wants of returned men. Out of this sum of
$130,000, according to the returns and the
books of the G.W.V.A., which were audited
by the accountant of the Department of
Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment-and there is
no disagreement between the Association and
the Department with regard to these expenditures-the following expenditures were made:
to "The Veteran" Limited, a weekly or
monthly publication published by the G.W.V.A.,
$46,000; salaries, $36,653.29; travelling expenses,
$15,885.66; loans to Provincial Commands,
$1,200; postage, telegrams and telephones,
$5,241.79; honorarium to R. B. Maxwell,
$3,000; convention expenses, $2,470.74; general
expenses, $2,161.87; and other expenditures of
a similar nature.
As stated in the report:
It would not appear that any portion of the said
sum of $130,000 had been spent on unemployment relief
for ex-service men and their dependents.

In addition to the sum of $46,000 paid to
"The Veteran" Limited, the accoun's show
that under the heading of Publicity and Propaganda" there was expended by the Association the sum of $6,045.95. The Committee's
report is:
(1) That, the moneys in the Canteen Fund belong
te all ex-srldiers of the Canadian Expeditionary Force,
and generally speaking, should only have been expended in whole or in part, in such a way as ta confer
a direct benefit upon all ex-service men.
(2) As a departure from the foregoing, there could
not be great exception taken ta an expenditure upon
certain of the ex-members of the Canadian Expediticnary Force and their dependents, who were ynemployed, or in needy circumstances, providing that such
unemployment, or needy circumstances, were not properly the especial care of Government agencies
maintained at the expense of the Government.
(3) Your Committee cannot believe that in making
grants of money from this Fund ta ex-soildier organizations the Government intended, or approved, of the
expenditure of such moneys te be made solely upon
the organizations themselves in the payment of salaries
to their headquarter officers, propaganda, honoraria,
and other headquarter expenses. If the Government did
se intend, or approve, your committee are et opinion
that such grants were improperly made from this
Fund.

The recommendation in regard to that is
as follows:
Your Committee recommend that the whole of this
Fund bc disposed of in accordance with the provisions
of Bild No. 32, as amended by the report of the Special
Committee of the Senate, ta whom the said Bill was
referred, subject only te the repayment te the Disablement Fund of the sum et $15,000, more particularly
referred ta in the report of this Committee on the
Disablement Fund.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: I think I
should draw the honourable gentleman's attention to the fact that the Order called was
S--38

593

for the consideration of the amendments te
Bill 32.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Then I should
like to invert the order, because it is not
logical at all. However, I am in the hands
of the House.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It is simply to
keep the House straight on the matter.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: All I have said
so far refers to Qrder No. 2. It deals exclusively with the Canteen Fund, and that
is all I have spoken of.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I point out
that the Order called was No. 2: "Consideration of the amendments made by the Special
Committee to whom was referred Bill 32, An
Act respecting the disposal of the Canteen
Funds." Order No. 4 is: "Consideration of the
report of the Special Committee on the administration of the Canteen Funds." That relates to the report the honourable gentleman
has been discussing.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I ask the leave of
the House to invert the order and deal with
the report first, and then, if that is adopted,
I might deal with the Bill.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it the pleasure of the bouse that that procedure be
adopted?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Carried.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I have nothng
more to say with regard to that part of it. I
leave it to the House te adopt the report or
not.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Now I proceed with
the Bill. All I intend to say is that the Bill
is strictly in accordance with the recommendations of the report I have just read.
bon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We will
assume that.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
May I ask one question as to the part of the
Fund which was used for the support of the
organ of the Great War Veterans' Association?
Was that use of the money authorized by
the Government or did the Government
simnly give over $130,000 to the Association
and allow the Association to make such use
as it'pleased of it? It seeme rather an odd
thing for the Government ta subsidize a newspaper, even of the Great War Veterans, out
of the Canteen Fund.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I think it was
made perfectly clear te the Committee that
the expenditure of this $130,000 by the Do-

REVISED EDITION

SENATE

594

minion Command of the Great War Veterans'
Association was not in accordance with the
desire or the declared intention of the Government, as appears by the Order in Council.
Under Order in Council P.C. 2378 the money
would appear to have been advanced to the
Great War Veterans' Association for the
purpose of extending the scope and usefulness
of that Association. Those are the terms of
the Order in Council, and the money was
spent almost altogeher on "The Veteran"
and on the head office of the Association.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 32, an Act
respecting the disposal of the Canteen Funds,
as amended by the Special Committee.
Hon. Mr. Taylor in the Chair.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-"Canteen Funds:"
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: When the report was
being made I did not catch the precise recommendation that was being made by the Committee. Did they approve or disapprove of
the expend-iture of the money? Further, I
would like to ask the Chairman of the Committee to inform us whether or not there is
any recommendation with regard to tbe remainder of the money. It is pretty bard to
get back money that has been wrongfully
expended, if any has been.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I did explain that,
but myx honourable friend did not follow. If
he will look at paragraph 3 of the Report he
will see that the Committee found that it
was not a proper expenditure of that money.
Paragmaph 3 of the report reads:
(3) Your Committee cannot believe that in making
grants of

noney from

this Fund to ex-soldier organ-

izatons the Government intended, or approved, of the
expenditure of such moneys to be made solely upon
the organizations thenselves in the payment of salaries
to their headquarter officers, propaganda, honoraria,
and other headquarter expenses. If the Government
did so intend, or approve, your Committee are of
opinion that such grants were improperly made from
this Fund.

The recommendation which immediately
follows is that Bill 32 be amended in the
light of this report; and the amended Bill
which is now submitted by the Committee is
changed with a view of disposing of the rest
of the Canteen Fend.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
gentlemen, I think I can save the time of the
Committee by saying a few words now on the
purpose of this Bill and the effect of the Committee's recommendations upon it.
Hon.

Mr. BELCOURT.

The Bill falls into three main parts. We
bave at our disposal the sum of $2,300.000
odd. The Bill proposes that the sum of $50.000 shall be set aside for the American Red
Cross to assist that body in taking care of exmembers of the Canadian forces who are in
large numbers in the United States. The Bill
further provides for the allocation of $50,000 to
a similar fund in Great Britain, to be used
for the relief of ex-members of the Canadian
Forces in Great Britain. It provides for the
retention of $20,000 to cover the possibility
of accounts coming in against the Fund that
are not now foreseen. It provides also the sum
of $100,000 to be handed to Trustees, to be
appointed, for the establishment of a Veterans'
Bureau in the city of Ottawa. With regard to
the whole of the remainder, it provides that
the money shall be divided among the several
provinces of 'Canada on a pro rata basis, having regard to enlistments, etc.
The Committee in its report approves of
that part of the Bill which sends $50,000 to the
American Red Cross. The Committee approves of allocating $50,000 for a similar purpose in Great Britain. The Committee approves of the retention of $20,000 to meet
possible claims that may be submitted or outstanding accounts. The Committee also approves of the distribution of the residue
amongst the several provinces, in the nianner
set out in the Bill.
But the Committee does not approve of the
allocation of $100,000 to Trustees, to be appointed, and located here in Ottawa, and for
the establishment of a Dominion Veterans'
Bureau. The Committee in their report set
out that they think that all the money in the
Canteen Fund belongs to all soldiers in Canada, and it ought to be so distributed as to
confer a benefit upon all soldiers. The Committee are of opinion that no portion of this
sum of money should be used for the establishment of a Dominon Veterans' Bureau. The Committec come to that conclusion after having
heard the evidence of representatives of a
number of ex-service men's associations in
Canada. So the Committee recommend that
that portion of the Bill whiclh sets aside the
suma of $100,000 for the establishment of a
Veterans' Bureau be struck out of the Bill,
and that the Bill be amended accordingly.
I should draw the attention of the House
to another small item, which we are striking
out, and which needs a word of explanation.
The British Government, from certain funds,
have placed at the disposal of the Canadian
Government £5,000 for the relief of ex-members of the Imperial Forces who may be living
We recommend that the proin Canada.

JUNE 19, 1925
vision with regard to those funds be struck
out of that Bill. The effect of that proposed
amendment will be to leave in the hands of
the Government, the disposai of the sumn of
£5,000, and ]et the Government find some
suitable way of handling it.
Ail the amendments to be put forward will
be, therefore, for the purpose of carrying out
the recommendations of the Committee as
I have outlined them.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Do I understand my honourable friend to
say that the $100,000 which it was proposed
to allocate to a Bureau here goes to the
provinces for distribution?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Yes. There is
one small arnendment, whieh the Committee
overlooked and to which my attention was
called a littie while ago.
I the report just
read to the House by the honourable gentleman from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) you
will note that we recommend that the sum
of $15,000 be repaid from. the Canteen Fund
to the Disablement Fund, deait with in another report.
It was pointed out to me a
few moments ago that it will be necessary
to inslert in the Bill before us a provision
for the payrnent of that,815,000. If we paas
the Bill without doing so, the Government
will not be in funds to make the payment.
When we corne to the appropriate place, I
will move that amendment.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I want to add
just one word with regard to the Bill.
It
was intended to create two bodies.
First,
there wa-s to be a Central Board of Trustees,
composeýd of three memnbers.
That provision
we have stricken out. The other body was
a provincial board.
The Bill as now pre-sented provides merely for a provincial board,
which will administer the funds in the proportions stated in section 6.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Carried.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: The amendments proposed by the Committee are set
out one by one, and I shail put them as the
different sections are reaehed.
From section
2 it is proposed to strike out these words:
Other than the allotmnent of 5,000 pounds made by
tha Council of the 'United Services Fund, "British
Fond" shall mean the said allotmnent.

The amendment was agreed to, and section
2 as amended was agreed to.
On section 3-Central Board of Trustees:
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: The Com.mittee propose to strike out of this section
the words:
&-3&ý

595

There shal *be appointed by the Governor in Council
a central board of trustees consisting of three members
who shall serve without remuneration for a period of
three years and shall be eligible for reappointment, and.

The amendment was agreed to.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: The section
will then read:
There may be appointed by the Governor in Council
a Board of Trustees for the Yukon Territory consisting of three members who shall serve without remuneration for the period of three years and shalh be eligible
for reappointment.

Section 3 as amended was agreed to.
Section 4 was agreed to.
On section 5-majority to be ex-members
of forces:
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN:
Section 5
reads 110w:
5. A majority of the members of the Central Board
of Trustees and of each provincial Boarli of Trustees
shali be ex-members of the forces, who have seen service overseas.

It is proposed to striks out the words:
0f the Central Board of Trustees and.

The amendrnent was agreed to, and section
5 as amended waa agreed to.
On section 6, paragraph (a)-allotment of
Funds; outstanding accounts:
The Hon. the CHAIlIMAN: There is no
amendment to paragraph (a).
Paragraph (a) was agreed to.
On section 6, paragraph (b)-adjustment service and bureau at Ottawa:
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: It is proposed
to strike out paragraph (b).
The amendment was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I miove that in
lieu of that clause the following section be inser.ted:
The s'uan of 315,000 shsfll be paid to the Disablement
Fund ini reimbursement of a h
nan made by the truste@
of the said fond to the Dominion Veterans' Alliance.

The amend'ment was agreed to.
On paragraph (c)-United Services Fund:
The Hon. the CHAIiRMAN: There is no
amendment.
Hon. Mr. ROCHfE: I would like to have a
little explanation as to why these moneys
should be sent to an Association, in the United
States, for instance, of whoma we have no
control and no knowledge. Furthermore, these
moneys were eontributed býy the Canadian
soldiers. Goodis were purchased, at large
profits, no doubt, in England, and theî were

SENATE

596

distributed te the soldiers at advanced prices.
Now the soldiers, a great many of them, want
to know, where the money that they have contributed is going-whether it is to be spent in
salaries or sent to organizations, and whether
they will get no benefit from it whatever. It
is all very well to divide up a large sum of
money, but those who ought to be beneficiaries
of it should have some control over it. I do
not understand why any soldiers who joined
the forces in England should be beneficiaries of
a fund which Canadian soldiers exclusively
created and to which they contributed. Of
course, the officers contributed a great deal for
luxuries and other things, but I think the
common soldiers ought to be considered and
ought to receive what benefits accrue from this
fund which had been accumulated from what
they spent out of their pay. I understand
they received three francs a day in France
monthly, and with the money they bought
luxuries and other articles from the canteen.
I thinik that, if there is any profit accruing
from the accumulated fund, the real Canadian
soldiers should get the benefit of it.
Honourable
GRIESBACH:
Hon. Mr.
It is
gentlemen, the answer is very simple.
estimated-although there can be no exact
figures-that there are 100,000 ex-members of
the Canadian Expeditionary Forces in the
United States at the present time. They are
cut off from participation in this fnud. The
Committee is informed that ex-members of the
Canadian Forces who are in needy circumstances in the United States have been for
some time cared for by the American Red
Cross. The proposal is to reimburse the
American Red Cross, or place them in funds to
continue the work.
So far as Great Britain is concerned, there
is a large but unascertained number of exmembers of the Forces there at the present time.
After demobilization a great many of thema
who were in needy circumstances were cared
for from the British Fund, and the Committee
have thouglit it well to approve, upon the
advice of the officials of the Department,
the allocation of $50,000 to Great Britain. I
would draw the attention of my honourable
friend to the fact that from the British fund
the sum of $25,000 has been sent over here for
the care of ex-members of the Imperial Forces.

Hon. Mr. ROCHE: Do I understand that

was given by the British Government? We
cannot aiter those terms inthat way.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The effect of the
change in the preamble is this. The funds
sent over by the British Government amount
to $25,000, and were to be handled, distributed
and cared for by Trustees appointed under
this Bill. We are not appointing any Trustees

I merely desire to say, honourable gentlement, having had some part in the work of

Section 7 as amended was agreed to.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Sections 8,
9 and 10 of the original Bill are struck out.
On section 10-pension to widowed mother
prospectively dependent:
Hon. Mr. CRIESBACH : There is an
explanation that I would like to make in
regard to that proposed section. It reads as
foliows:
Provided further that the provisions of subsection
seven of this section shall apply to a widowed mother
who fails into a dependent condition after the death
of the member of the forces and who in the opinion of
the Commission would have been wholly or to, a
substant'al extent maintained by the member of the
forces had he ot died.

That is a clause which seeks to put upon
the samne basis as the widowed mother or
dependent parent wbat we caîl the prospective
dependent. To illustrate: a woman whose
son enlisted for the war and at that time
designated bis mother as bis dependent,
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN.

ssigning to bier a portion of bis pay, etc.,
wvas killed. Under tbe iaw as it now stands,
sbe would immediately become entitled to a
widow's pension, wbicb she draws witbout
any deduction wbatever. There is a second
class. It is the case wbere a man enlists for
tbe war, desiguates no dependent, and is
killed. Five, six or seven years %,ter tbe
motber falîs into a dependeut condition. 11cr
husbasnd dies, we will say. Thereupon, allcging tbat bier son woiild bave supported bier
bad bie lived, and alleging furtber that sbe
is in a dependent position, sbe becomes
entitled to the motber's pension; but auy
pension tbat sbe may receive is subject to
deductions, witbin certain limitations of incomne tbat she may bave. Tbat is tbe difference between tbe two classes. In the first
class, the motber wbo sent bier son to tbe war
is entitled to a full pension. and in the second
clsss the motber is entitled to a pension of
the samne amount, but subject to deductions
for property or incomne tbat sbe may bave.
Tbe purpose of this amendment was t0
bring into tbe first class ail thbe persans in
tbe second class; tbat is to say, to free tbe
second class from deductions for incomne or
property of any sort. Tbe Committee relect
tbis clause, and 1 am in full agreement with
the rejection, and tbink that a word of
explanation of tbe reason is desirable.
The rejection of tbis clause obviously involves no great bardsbip. Persons in tbe
second class bave their portion of the pensicn,
and their incomne, wbatever it may be. Mark
you, if tbey bave no incarme at ail, and are
wbolly depeudeut, tbey get the full pension. In
any case tbese persous iu tbe second class
have such portion of the pension as max' be
awarded, and tbey bave tbe benefit of any
incarme. 1 say that these peon)le are sufflcieutly
well prcvided for, baving regard t0 their circumstances, and that tbey are less entîtled
f0 tbe beneficence of tbe Government than
other classes of persaus who might be named.
1 take the v'iew tbat ex-service mon should
realize that in disposiug of pensions we are
not dealing witb an unlimited sumn of money:
we are dealing with a limnited sum. The financial condition of tbe country necessitates the
exercise of care in the dispoýsai of wlsat we
have to spend, and tbere are classes of persons
more entitled fo consideration than the class
in question. A class wbich wili invite the
attention of thbe people of thîs -couutry in
the near future, in rapidly growiutr numbers,
is the ex-service man who enlisted late in life
and wbo is to-day prematurely old and may
ftsll înce a dependent condition. The question
will arise, wbat is tbe country goîng to do

JUNE 19, 1925
for him? I think already Departments of the
Government are planning for the situation
that may arise, and no doubt this House will
in course of time have to consider that question. These men, who themnselves served,
and may become dependent ini the future, in
ever-incrcasing numbers, are more entitled to
consideration than are the persons in the
second class of which I have spoken. Therefore I say that we should so conduct our
financial affairs with respect to aid to exservice men that when those ex-service mxen
become dependent we shaîl not have spent the
whole of our resources. For that reason I am
in agreement with the striking out of this
clause, aq recommended in the report of the
Committee.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
My honourable friend, I imagine, is very well
posted in these matters and I would like to
ask him one or two questions. Will the
general effect cf this Bill be to enlarge to
any extent the number of beneficiaries and
to add to the amount which is required annually?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBAOH: The whole Bill?
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
The wbiole Bill.
The second question is
akin to tbat: if we kept a cool head and,
while attempting to do what is just and fair,
do not give way to undue sympathy, have
we reached about the peak number cf our
pensions?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: With respect to
the first question, whether or flot tbe whole
Bill increases tbe amount hiable to be paid
annually, I may say that the Bil1 as it was initroduced certainly does, but the Bill
as amenjdeà by the Committee does net
greatly increase the amount. The clause I
bave here, it was estimafed by the Board
of Pension Commissioners, would cost $500,000
per annum, but tlie clause bas been amended,
and I have flot before me any figure of
what the in-creased liability would -ho under
the amended clause.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: If my honourable friend will allow me, I may be able
to make an explanation in answer ta the right
bonourable gentleman. Clause 8 of the Bill,
wbich we have struck out entirely, would
have increased the amount very considerably.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE FOSTER: Half
a million?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I mean, in two
respects. Paragraph (i) of stibsection (b)
would alone have entailed an expenditure of
haîf a million dollars, according to the state-

599

ment furnished to us by the Chairman of
the Pension Board.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Per annum?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Per an!num. Then
under paragraphs ii, iii and iv-I forget
exactly how much Colonel Thompson told
us the burden would be increased; but my
recollection, whicb. is perhaps a littie vague,
is that the amounit was in millions; and was
confirmed in bis statement 'by Mr. Paton, bis
assistant. It would he somewhere between
two and three million dollars. That whole
section is struck out. So I think it may fairly
be clairned that the work of the Committee
has relieved the Treasury by three or three
and a hall million dollars provided for in the
Bill îtself.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
And the other question-whether we have
prdba'bly reached the peak of ouT pension
load.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That is a very
difficult question to answer. 'It depends on
whetber the Act remains as it is or is constantly amended in the future.
Right Hon. Sir GEOR~GE E. FOSTER:
0f course. But as it is now?
Hon. Mr. GRIESIBACHI: Uf the Act stands
unamended? By the termis of this Bill we
fix a period of seven years from the date
of a -man~s discharge, after which period hie
cannot make application for a pension unless
bis documents oontain. a specification of the
injury upon which hie dlaims a pension. He
is not to, ho barred by statute in that case.
Many deaths are oecurring among pensioners,
and these result in a deduction. There is a
smaîl increase in the total amount. Accordin& to the estimates of this year, the total
is a million dollars more than last year; but
I would point out to the House tbat the
estimates for tbe Department of Soldiers'
Civil Re-establishment are a million dollars
less. This means that men came off treatment and went on pension, and it is an equalization.
But tbe House must face in the future the
problcm of the prematurely old man, the mani
,Wbo enlisted late in liýfe, as xnany did. Sonie,
enlistcd at tbe age of 50, representing thcmselves as 40, and went off and d4d their bit.
Many of those men are breaking down. The
Department of Soldiers' Civil Re-estnblisbment has started a tentative plan to look
after them: but un-less we have a very su-bstantial measure of prosperity in this country,
wbicb will take care af everything, we shdl

SENATE
be confronted, perhaps five or six years hence.
with a problem which will necessitate soldiers'
homes. I do not see how we can escape
that.
I do not suppose any one can see what the
future has in store for us. It depends on the
amendment brought in from time to time,
and it would seem that we have fairly well
reached the end of amendments which may
be put through. There will be many applications received; but if a statesmanlike view
is taken of the whole matter, and if regard
is had for the problems of the future, it will
be unnecessary to refuse some extreme applications to provide for the future. On the
other hand, pensioners are dropping off, and
their pensions are stopping.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I think it may be
said that this Bill bas not in any substantial
way increased the burdens. If these are today larger than they were a year or two ago
it is simply because men entitled to pensions
have in the meantime applied for and received them. The increase is not by reason
of the Bill itself.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER:
My question was prompted by a desire
for information for myself, and also because
of my fear of the scandalous manner in
which the pension system was abusbd in the
United States after the Civil War.
Sixty
years after that war had entirely ceased, the
roll of pension expenditures was probably
larger than at any period in its history.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That was due in
the United States primarily to the lack of
records. No importance was attached in the
American Civil War to the keeping of records.
On the other hand, the records of the Canadian service in the later war are the best
records that hava ever been kept in any war
at any time. Honourable members may recall that 500 tons of documents came back to
Ottawa and are stored here. There is a
triplicate record of every man. Every time
his name is mentioned in any conceivable
way it is entered in his record. Every medical
entry, every promotion, award, appointment,
transfer, change,
absence without leave,
offence, crime, or any possible thing that
could happen to him has gone into that
record. The result is that, having passed the
statutes that we have, only very occasionally
is it possible for a man to be without complete documentation. Owing to mistakes in
names, or accidents of some sort, the file may
sometimes be incomplete, but in 999 cases out
of 1,000 the documentation is absolutely complete in respect to every officer and man that
Hon. Mr.

GRIESBACH.

served. That is the first thing to consider in
the prevention of a pension scandal.
I have had to do with American pension
cases. I know a man six feet six in height,
who ,got a pension on the ground that the
blankets with which he was supplied were
too short, and he contracted rheumatism in
the service. He received $13 a month, and
back pension for nearly 40 years.
The second point is that the United States
statutes were not carefully drawn, and thus
not satisfactorv.
Political influence was also
allowed to intervene, and the practice of introducing special Acts for individuals arose,
such Acts being introduced for thousands of
men at every session, and jammed through
the House-not unlike another sort of legislation that we have in this country-and
nobody asked any questions.
So the first thing is documentation, and the
second thing is law which is just and fair,
covers the ground fully, and is absolutely
adhered to by the officials of the Department
and by the Board of Pension Commissioners,
and administered not with sympathy but as
I have contended many times, administered
as the law is. If the law is not satisfactory,
this is the body empowered to change it. If
we stick to those two principles, documentation and the observance of the statutes, we
will keep out of the trouble that the United
States got into.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER:
Has any change been made in the Board of
Pension Commissioners?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: No change that I
know of.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER:
At one time there seemed to be a rising ride
of dissatisfaction with and antagonism against
the Pension Commissioners' administration;
has that cooled off measureably?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I think it has to
some extent cooled off.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We have
a Board of Appeal.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: There is a Board
of Appeal that has afforded a safety valve.
Since their organization they have heard
1.200 cases, and they have reversed the findings of the Board of Pension Commissioners
in about 300 cases out of the 1,200. That furnishes a safety valve.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: In regard to the
time within which all th.se applications will
have to be finally dealt with, honourable
gentlemen may look at subsection 13 of new

JUNE 19, 1925
clause S, where it appears that an application
must be made:
(a) within three years after the date of thse death
in respect of which pension is claimed, or
(tb) within three years after thse date upon which thse
applicant bas f allen ioto a dependent condition, or
(c) within seven years after thse date upon Zhch the
applicant was retired or discherged from the forces.

So I think we can safely say that by the
year 1927 we shall have before us ail the
applications that could ho deait with, and
that any application made for any cause after
that date will not ho entertained, because the
time for doing so will have elapsed in other
words, ail such applications will be proscribed
hy that date.
Section 10 wau agreed to.
Sections il to 15 inclusive were agreed to.
On section 16--appeals:
Hon. Mr. GRIE¾SBACH: I have a few
observations, ia connectien with that section,
having a lively recollection of something that
happened two years ago, in which 1 dîffered
with the Committee, and came in for a certain
amount of criticismn by apparently agreoing
with the-m and then disagreeing in the House.
I wisb to say that this section sets out the
grounds upon which an appeal may be taken
from the Board of Pension Commissioners to

seiction came before the Commîttee they
struck out the words at the end of the section,
"ior was the result of misconduct," and I
agreed with them.
The situation is this. An application for a
pension is made to the Board of Pension
The iaw proCommissioners, and is refused.
vides that upon the evidence of record an
appeal shahl lie. It is aiso provided in the
statute that if the Board of Pension Cernmissieners refuse a pension on the ground that
if the disabil'ity fromn which the man claims
to be suffering, and in respect of which lie is
entitled to a pension, was de to improper
conduct, no appoal to the Board of Appeai
shahl lie.
When the Gom'mittee asked for an explanation from the Board of Pension Commissioners as te, the meaning of these words,
they pointed out that if an application were
made for a pension, and the Board rejected
the application on tho ground that the disability from which the man was suflerig wa.s
due to impro'peir conduct, that might ho
drunkenness or venereal disease. I think the
Committee formed the idea that those words
which were struck out would have the effoct
cf giving a man suffering from venereal disease
a pension therefor; but such is net the meaning or intention of those words.

Honourable gentlemen will see at a glance
that if a man applies for a pension on the
ground that he is suffering from heart trouble,
and he is se suffering from heart trouble, but
traces of venereal disease are discovered in
the couse of lis medical examinatien, and the
medical officers cf the Pension Board say that
the contraction or aggravation cf bis cernpl!aint is due te venereal disease, thon the
pension will be refused on the ground cf
If a pension is refused
improper conduet.
on the ground cf impreper conduet, then ne
appeal lies te the Board cf Appeal, under the
law as it now stands.
The Minister himself and the Board of
Appeal take the view that, if a man bas been
refused a 'pesion on the ground that bis
disease or disability is due te impreper conduct, ho has as much riglit cf appeal on that
ground as ho bas on any other. The present
1.aw dees net give a man a pension for
improper canduct; it dees net give a man a
pension for venereal disease; it refuses him a
pension for ail those things-f or any impropor
conduet.
But the quesltion as te whether lie was properly refused a pension on the ground that bis
disability was due te impropor conduet is a
matter in which ho ought te have an appoal,
because the medical advîsers cf the Board
cf Pension Cominissioners may ho as wrong
about that as they may ho wrong on anything
else.
The words which were struck eut in
tbe Committee, "or was the result cf misconduct," were introduced at the suggestion
cf the Board cf Appeal, te give te the man
who has been refused a pension by the Board
cf Pension Commissieners the riglit te appeal
in the case where bis pension wus refused on
the ground that bis disuibility was due te
impropor conduct.
In view ef my experienco two years ago,
and -on the ýadvice of my learned and bionourâble friend on my lef t (Hon. 'Mr. Belcourt), I amn pubting the case 'bofore the
Senate, .and leaviing it for this Commi'ttee te

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Sinco the matter
ig lef.t witb the Co'mrittee, I tbinik the duty
devolves on the Chairman cf the Special
Committee te which this Bill was refeoered, 'te
say sjamething on this -point. I believe that
when this section was before the Cemmittee
there was a misconcegption. I -think we all

SENATE
exa.ctiy to wbat 1 believe was the intention of
the Commit.tee, and as te wbich unquestionably there bas been a misconception.
I agree
with my
honourable
friend
that there ought to be an appeal frorm the
Board of Pension
Commisqioners to the
Federai Appeail Board in the case of injury
resulting from misconduct as in A the o-ther
cases. Aiýppeails are deait with by the Federal
Board on the ground that possibly an errer
was made by the Pension Commissioners with
reg-ard te the rigbht od the applicant to a pension. I ýcannot see why there ebould be a
difference between an applicant w~ho bazz
been disentitiled because of misconduet and
another applicant wvho wvas refused for etb-r
reasons as to any errer on the part of the
Pension Board. It seems te mie tbat a man
wbo has been refused bis penzýion because et
aileged misconduct lias as much right te appeal
from that decision as the man whose disabilitv
bas not been admitted. It is an appeal in
botb cases in order te ascertain flnaily wbether
tbe finding of the Pension Board w-as strietly
in accerdance with the evidence. My bonourable friend tells me that there are 12 cases
of this sert now. wbich have been refused the
rigbt of apl)eal beeause they were dpclared by
the Pension Boeard net te be entitled te penz-ien because of miscenduct.
Hon. Sir JAiMES LOUGHEED: Hon-ourab!e gentlemen, I recail the discussion before
the Committee as te tbe elimination of these
words. We baid before us the Cha.irman of
tbe Pension Board, Colonel Thompson. who
strongly disapiproved of the retention of those
wod.He informiedu
the Cominittee that
tbey bad been put in there unwittingly, and
strengly aidvised the Committee net te retain
them in the section.
It is tmnfortunnte that on a higbly technical
subjeet of this kind a question should arise
when wve have net ýbeýfre us the memnbers of
the Pension Board, wbo are familiar with the
subjeet. 1 tbink it is very dangerous to enlarge the grottnds for appeail. The results
demonstrate that the Appeai Board bas 'thrown
open the deors výery widc-ly, and the country
býas been put te a very large ergpense by
reason of appeals alloe'd by that Board. It
bas 'beanome a matter of comment, and 'tbeir

lion. Mr. GRIESBACH: The 'Comnmittee
struck these words out. The Bill as brought
down and passed by the liouse of Commons
proposed that a man wbo was refused a

appeal, and those three or four words were
designed to give hirn an appeal. The Comrnitte-e agrreed to strike those words out; but

lion. Mr. McMEANS:
arn concerned, I do not agree with tbe bonourable member for Calgary (lion. Sir James
Lougbeed) that there should flot be any appeal. Wbat is the reason for the creation of
an Appeal Board. Wbat is it for if it is not
to bear appeals?
lion. Mr. GRIESBACH: Section 11, that
we have just passed, provides as follows:
Prov'ded that.the said pension shall not be cancelied.
until an opportunity is given to the said pensioner to

enter a defence before the Commission against snch
canceflation, personaliy, or by accredited representative,
or as the Commission may direct; provided also thst
any pension whieh bas been suspended, discontinued or
cancelled snay in the discretion of the Commission be
reinstated if it is fonnd that the said pensioner is no
longer living uoder the conditions for which pension
was suspended, discontinued or cancelled.

That refers to the case of a womnan in
receipt of a pension who m-isconducts berself.
lion. Mr. McMEANS: Or is accused of
rnisconducting berseif.
lion. Mr. GRIESBACH: Yes, or'is accused
of misconduct. Formerly the Soldiers' Civil
Re-establishment Department had women
visitors who went around visiting, and some
of tbern were of the type who were easily
persuaded that an unfortunate woman was
not living as she should; and thereupon the
woman's pension was eut off, and the first
she learned. of it was when her cheque did not
corne. This provides that ber pension shahl
flot be eut off without notice and an opportunity of defending berseif.
lion. Mr. MeMEANS: Before wbom?
lion. Mr. GRIESBACH: Before the Pension Board.
lion. Mr. MeMEANS: Then, is there any
appeal against the decision of the Pension
Board on that particular point?
lion. Mr. BELCOURT: 1 tbink there wouid

lion. Mr. MeMEANS: There ought to be.

Act as it stood before this arnendment there

on the general principle of the Act there
would be an appeal.
lion. Mr. MeMEANS: I arn one of those
who believe that a woman who is the widow
of a soldier, and wbo is deprived of her busband-he bas been shot in the war-should
not. he interfered with as to ber morals by
the Pens-ion Board or anyone else. Tbat is a
very wide proposition, and I believe it is open
to a great deal of controversy. There was a
wornan living in tbe city of Winnipeg wbo
bad no support but ber pension. She was
accused of living a life of irnrorality. The
Pension Board eut off ber pension wîthout the
slightest notice. I think, perhaps, under tbe
existing Act, they were justified in doing se;
but the wornan was absolutely deprived of a
living. Wbat could she do?

604

SENATE

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The Pension
Act makes provision for the renewal of the
pension upon her conduct changing.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: The difficulty about
that is that she denied the accusation. The
case was brought down here to Ottawa, and
there was evidence taken about it here, there,
and everywhere. Meantime she had nothing
to live on.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Had she got no
notice?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: No. A deputation
came down here and came into my office and
talked about it. Some had one idea, and
some another; they were very much excited
about it. While I have a great respect for thE
Pension Board and Colonel Thompson, nevertheless the pension was cut off and she had no
appeal.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: But the honourable gentleman must know that there was
an investigation?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
I would like to
know if there is a right of appeal from the
Pension Board on any of these questions.
What is the use of having an Appeal Board
if there is no appeal? I am in favour of an
appeal every time; I would not limit it in any
case. It has been my experience in life that
if a mistake has been made, the Pension Board
or the court that makes the mistake would be
the first to say, "We will be only too glad to
have y-ou go to someone over us who can
review the question and point out the mistake
we made."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, we are now on clause 16. I made
a case for the text of the Bill as it came from
the other House. It said:
Upon the evidence and record upon which the Board
of Pienson Commissioners gave their decision an appea!
shall lie in respect of any refusal of pension by the
Biarl of Pension Commissioners on the ground that
the injuri or disease or aggravation thereof resulting
in dizahiity or death was not attributable to or was
not incurred during milîtary service.

I stop there for a moment. There is an
appeal if the Board of Pension Commissioners
say that the injury, disease, or death was not
incurred during military service. The Board
of Pension Commissioners may have come to
that conclusion after having found that the
cause of the injury, disease or death was misconduct ; but if they do not go a step further
and say that it was not incurred during
military service, there is no appeal. They may
find that the injury or disease or aggravation
resulting in disability or death was not incurred during military service, and then there
is an appeal.
IIon. Mr. McMEANS.

It seemed to me somewhat illogical, but the
argument was made, that there was a finding
as to the real cause of the disease or death,
and that upon that pronouncement there
should be no appeal. This to my mind is
what actuated the Committee in rejecting
that amendment. I confess that I have remained somewhat perplexed as to the logic
of the presentHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I must
say that I do not sec the necessity of the
words anyway, because he has an appeal if it is
found that the disease or aggravation resulting in disability or death was not incurred
during military service. He has an appeal on
this general ground, and the court of appeal
hears the whole matter.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: If they say they
refuse an appeal on the ground of misconduct, that is all they have to say, and he is
barred from the appeal.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
not say so.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBAOH: That is the interpretation they put upon it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is unfortunate that this question has been raised
at this point. We discussed it in the Committee, and the Comnittee were unanimous
and my honourable friend was satisfied.
It
means to me this might possibly open the
door to a very serious incursion of cases
which might represent a very substantial sum
of money. I would suggest that this matter
should stand. No injury could flow from that,
because we are amending the Pension Act
practically every year and, while I regret to
say it, I have no doubt it will be before us
again next year.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: I am very much surprised to see my honourable friend bring in
the amendment to put back what was struck
out in the Committee. We went very fully
into this matter. We had the members of
the Pension Board before us, and other witnesses, and we were unanimous in striking
this out.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
I was ju2t aunanimous as the honourable gentleman from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Sharpe). but since then
I have had a lengthy discussion with the
Secretary of the Appeal Board.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: He was at the Committee.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: No, he was not.
I agreed with the Committee, but in the

whom I had not seen before, called upon me
and put before me a number of concrete
cases, and ýexplained precisely what tihis

Hon. Sir JAMES LOIGHEFJD: Unf ortuna'tely we have not liad the advantage of
seeing the same gentleman.

Board of Pension Commissioners, and then
there la the Board of Appeal to review cases.
Then you say the Board of Appeal shahl not
hear appeals except in certain cases. Is there
anything more ridiculous than that?
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I wouhd hike to put this phase of the matter
before the members of the Senate for a
moment. It is when members of a Committee hear ail the evidence on both aides
of a case that we are able to get at the
bottom of the matter and corne to a decision.
There are members here-I -myseif arn one of
them-who have not had the opportunity of
being a inember oî that Comrnittee and
hearing both sides of the case. My protection
is laxgel-y in the fact the Committee as n
whole took up the matter thoroughhy, examined
it, flot ex parte, but on a broad basis, before
corning to a conclusion. I would rather rest
my judgment and decision upo-n that condition than decide aceording to the statement
of a member of the Committee, who, says
that after the Committee's decision lie has
heard ex parte evidence and changed bis
mind. The sarne evidence as lie has heard
might lie given to the Cornmittee and might
not change the Cornrittee's opinion. I feel
that I arn safe only when 1 .rely upon the
mature judigment of the Committee. If rny
honourable friend feels differently in Vhs
respect, no great harrn will lie done in waiting
another year. The matter can lie taken up
again.
Hon. Mr. GRIE&BACH: Precisely.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I do not like to see this anatter of appeal
widened and widened. The Appeal Board
bas certainly its proper functions, but it van
also do a great deal to saddle unnecesary
expense upon the country.

605

Hon. Mr. GRJESBACH:
I have no
apologies to offer for having brought the
matter up. It is a soinewhat important one.
I agreed with the Cornmittee, but I have had
a different view put -before me, a.nd I thought
it well to present it. I do flot press the point,
however. I merely lay it before the Cornmittee.
Section 16 as amended was agreed to.
On section 17-operation of certain provisions and review of cases:
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Section 17'
bais been amended by the striking out of inies
18, 19 and 26 the words "th.ree, eiglit, nine".
Is it also suggested that a new clause be
added as clause B:
Section nine of the said Act is amended by adding
thereto the following subsection:
(3) The Coennission, represented by one or more
Commissioners, mnay in its discretion hold sittings in
any part of Canada for the purpose of hearing evid ene or complaints in respect of pensions.

The amendrnents were agreed to, and section 17 as amended was agreed, to.
Section 18 was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: In clause 13
there is a provision for making permanent the
bonus which lias been attached to pensions
for some years-since 1919, I think. Honourable gentlemen will remember that in Canada
the pension we have been paying has consisted
of two-thirdsa pensgion and one-third bonus,
the 'bonus being added iii order to meet the
high cost of living. Year after year requests
have come that this bonus be made a permanent part of the pension. Last Session
it was extended. for one year. It is now made
a permanent extension. The Raîston Commission recommended that it be extended for
five years, but the Bill itself makes it perpetual, and the Committee have agreed to it.
In support of the Committee's view it is
pointed 'out that pensions payable in Canada,
New Zealand, Australia and the United
States are on fairly equal terims, with the
exception that an unmarried man in Canada
receives M90a year and in. the United States
he receives $1,200. The married men in
Canada and those in the United States are
on equal terms of pension, but the single
men are not. The pensions in these countries
are being settled for ail. tirne, and the purpose
of this clause in the Bill is to make permanent
the bonus heretofore paid.

HOME BANK DEPOSITORS RELIEF
BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 182, an
Act for the relief of the Depositors of tht
Home Bank of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Willoughby in the Chair.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable members of this Chamber will recall
that we postponed consideration of this Bill
in order to permit of the members of the
Senate hearing an explanation of the whole
situation of the Home Bank from the LiquiHe was heard this

morning by the Banking and Commerce Committee and a large number of other members. After hearing his statement the Banking and Commerce Committee appointed a
ýmal1 subcommittee to study the situation
and prepare amendments in accordance with
the mean opinion of the iSenate, which I
thought I had gathered two or three days
ago, when we were discussing the second
reading. The sub-committee was presided
over by the Chairman of the Committee on
Banking and Commerce, who will present
amendments which, I believe, they carried
unanimously.
Hon. G. G. FOSTER: Honourable gentlemen. this sub-committee submit to you a
Bill on which they have unanimously agreed.
They have made certain changes in the
original Bill, but have followed as far as
possible its wording. The changes that they
have made in the Bill are material and most

the country is concerned, is that they limit
to $3.000,000 the possible obligations of the
Government. Provision is made for the payment of depositors who have claims up to
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

$500, also for those whose deposits were
above that amount. I will hand to the Chairman of the Committee the draft of the
amendments we have made, and he can read
them clause by clause.
Hon. Mr. REID: Honourable gentlemen, I
would lile to say a few words before we proceed with this Bill. I was a member of the
Committee that agreed on the Bill as it is
now presented. When I made· a motion a
day or two ago. I was, as I then stated,
strongly of the opinion that with suffloient
time we could bring in a Bill that would save
a great deuil for the country and be perhaps of
greater a,dvantage to the creditors and
delpositors. We agreed to this Bill going inito
Committee on the distinct understanding that
we did not accept the principle. However, I
cm glad thait the Bilhl is now in its present
shape.
What I rose particularly to say was that
when I moved my amendiment I asked for
time. The Session is now so far advanced.
and such important business is te come before us, that it is impossible to deal with this
matter fully ýin the limited time that we have.
I only wiýsh that the Government had givien
us an opportunity of going into this matter
thorourghly, for I believe we might have saved
more money and possibly some delpositors
might have fared better. However, the Committee having agreed to the Bilil as it now
appears, I am quite wiling that it should go
throuah, but registering my protest against
bringing in such an important measure at this
late heur.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-payment of amounts due to
depositors in Home Bank:
The
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
amount mentioned is $3,000.000, and the percenitage is 35 per cent. I should like to ask
whether the amount in the previous Bill $5.450.000, was arrived at by the 'Government on
the basis of 35 per cent on the deposits?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Yes:
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: It seems to me very unfair tiat an important Bi-Il of this kind should
be introduced without the members having
an opportunity cf reading the sections of the
Bill it is now proposed to adopt. I think
printed copies of this proposed Bill, or at
least typewritten corpies, should have been
circu'lated among the members, so that we
might know what we are doing. We cannot
hear a word of what the Chairman is reading, and to ask us to vote without having
heard, let alone being able te read, the Bill,
i.i very unfair.

JUNE 19, 1925
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I think I might explain the changes in the Bill. Ini the preamble
of the Bill as printed, the Government
a.cknoiwledged its moral responsibility. To
disapprove of such an acknowledgment of
moral regponsibility, a preaimlble will be submitted which reads as fol.lows:
Whereas certain creditors of the Home Bank of
Canada have by their petition to the Governor in
Council represented that they have, by the suspension
of that Bank, sustained serions losses which they are
ill able to bear, and have prayed that pecuniary aid
may be afforded them on the grounds of commisseratin and of an alleged moral responsibility of the Government of Canada for the causes of sncb losses and
whereas such responsibility is not admitted, but it is
expedient to afford pecuniary aid to certain of the said
creditors as provided by this Act: Therefore His
Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the
Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as
follows:

Then section 2 of the Bilil as prinýted provided for a -maximum amount of $5,450,000.
This is reduced by the new clause 2 to a
maximum of $3,000,000. That is the main
substantial change in thaît section.
Hon. Mr. REID: The Bill is very short;
would the honourable gentleman read the new
clause 2?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: For clause 2 substitute
the following:
2. From and out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund
there may be paid and applied an amount not exceeding three million dollars, for the purposes of paying. under the provisions of this Act, te the several
persons who were creditors of the Home Bank of
Canada, hereinafter called "the Bank," when the Bank
stspended payment, for money on deposit or in current
account, the amounts te which they are respectively
entitled as hereinafter provided: but in no case shall
any paynient so made exceed thirty-five per centum
of the claim of the creditor as settled and approved by
the Court in the winding up proceadings.

We propose to add to those two paragraphs
these further paragraphs:
(c) any person who is or bas been a director of the
Bank, or his estate, or any company in which he is or
has been a shareholder, or any firmof which he is or
has been a member; or
(d) the Government of any province, or to any city,
town, county, municipality, parish, school board,
educational institution, local improvement district, telephone district, or other similar corporation of institution; or
(e) any corporation, association, society, partnership,
club, friendly or mutual benefit society, religious or
church corporation, labour association, or any such
society, organization or association whatsoever; or
(f) any Senator or Member of the House of Commons
of Canada.

All those different classes are excluded from
the operation of the Bill.
After section 4 we suggest adding the following provision for relief-it is clause A here,
but it will be section 5 in the Bill:
1. The persons entitled to payment of aid under this
Act shall be such of the creditors referred to in sections two and three of this Act as are found by the
Conmmissioner hereinafter appointed to be in special
need by reason of the suspension of the Bank.
(2) The president of the Exchequer Court of Canada
or the Puisne Judge of that court, acting personally
asd not as that court, and hereinafter called "the
Commissioner", shall, upon application made to him
by any pacson whose claim has been settled and approved by the court in the winding up proceedings,
determine whether or not that creditor is entitled te
receive any, and if so what amount of, pecuniary aid
under the provisions of this Act. The Commissioner's
determination shall be final.
(3) For the purposes of such determination the
Conunissioner may prescribe the delay for fyling claims
to receive such aid, the evidence by affidavit or otherwise to be adduced ,in support of such daims, the procedure necessary or requisite, and ail other matters
requisite in the premises.
(4) So soon as possible after the expiration of the
said delay the Commissioner shall from time to time
prepare and forward to the liquidators of the Bank
a list showing the names of the persons who have been
found by the Commissioner to be entitled to aid under
this Act, and the amount of aid to which each such
person is entitled.

The wording at the end of this clause was
suggested by the liquidator, because he said
that there were a number of claims subject to

but that 35 per cent of all those claims be
paid. This will entail the payment of a little
over $1,000,000.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Will the depositars of
$500 or less require the $3,000,000 to pay their
35 per cent?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: No; it will take a
little over $1,000,000 to cover that, from what
we can make out.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: And the balance will
be left for what?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The balance will be
left to be d.isposed of by the Commissioner.
Then we have this provision:
(b) Any creditor failing to take advantage of this
Act within twelve months from the date of its passing
shall be absolutely barred from receiving any benefit
therefrom.

This is to guard against the money remaining in the hands of the liquidator of the Bank
for any great period of time. There are 53,000
depositors, and there may be a large number
within the $500 or less, who will be provided
for. The Committee thought proper to fix a
date within which all parties who desire to
take advantage of this Bill should make their
application. Clause C is as follows:
The Minister of Finance shaH annually submit to
Parliament, within fourteen days of the opening thereof,
a detailed statement show:ng the names and addresses
of all persons who have received aid under this Act,
the amount of their respective claims, and the amount
paid to each.

Then we go on with the Bill as printed:
5. The distr bution of the said sum as herein provided
may be mode by the liquidators of the Bank, and payient of the said som may be made to the liquidators
for such purpose.
6. In case of the decease of any of the persons who
were creditors as aforesaid, payment shall be made to
their executors or administrators.
7. The Governor in Council may raise by way of loan,
temporarv or otherwise, upon such form of security and
upon such termis and conditions as the Governor in
Council may approve, such sum or sums of money as
ase required for the purpose of making the payment
authorized by this Act. and any sum se raised shal
ferni part cf the Consolidated Revenue Fund.

I have omitted to say that after the new
paragraphs c. d, e and f, enumerating the
classes of creditors excluded from the operation of the Act, we suggest adding the fellowing:
Any question arising under this section shah be
determined by the Commissioner, and his decision shall
be final.

That is the suggestion of the liquidator.
He called our attention to the fact that a
number of the parties excluded might claim
that they did not come within the classes
excluded, and suggested that it should be
left to the Exchequer Court.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

Has
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
provision been made for the Commissioner to
delegate his authority to others, so that sessions may be held in the different cities
throughout the Dominion? I think it is very
desirable that that should be done. He could
eisily delegate his duties to the County Court
judge, or some other judicial official.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I made that suggestion, but ithe Committee thought &t was
sufficiently covered by the powers given to
the Commissioner.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It did not
strike me that he had that power.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I must say that I
have some doubt.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
'What
kind of evidence must the Commissioner take?
I should think you should provide that he is
not bound to take viva voce evidence.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It is so stated:
For the purpose of such determination the Commissioner may prescribe the delay for' fyling claims to
receive such aid, the evidence to be adduced in support of such claims, the procedure nebessary or requisite and all other matter requisite in the premises.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
My
point is that the Commissioner might consider
that he was bound to take evidence viva
voce, which would entail an enormous number of court sittings. He should take such
evidence as he thinks proper.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: If there is any doubt
about it, we might say, "by affidavit or otherwis'e." We will add that.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
May I ask the
honourable gentleman if he considers this Bill

House of Commons?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The Iiquidator's

the Cornrittee regard that recommendation?

Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: The newspaper is
wrong.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER:
The reporter's mistake.
Hon. Mr. BEI-QUE:

Yes, the reporter's

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Then if is only

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The liquidator was
very disereef.

11e limited himself f0 answer-

ing thbe questions put fo him, and to giving
proper information.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

There is one

feature of the Committee's recommendation
thaf 1 want f0 heartily endorse, and that is
the reference to members of Parliament. 1
happen f0 be a member of Parliament
who had in the Home Bank a deposit
of
approximately
$3,000.
I
want
f0
make a statement now, because a ruinour
has been
going -around the
corridors
of the building for the last three days thaf
if this Bill carne to a vote in the House rny
vote would be challenged. I wanf f0 announce
to the House that I have no pecuniary interest whafever in this measure.
When, a
few days ago, I received a most p-afhetie
letter, whieh I rend to the House, I defermined thaf no private interest would debar
me frorn doing what I believed f0 be rny
public dufy in this matter; and for the purpose of placing myseif in such a position that
I could casf a vote, I assigned ail rny intcrest in the matter f0 that crippled girl. I
therefore want the Cornmittee f0, know that
fhr'y have not disqppointed me at all hy inserting the provision debarring members of
hoth Houses of Parliamnent having claims as
deposif ors.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:

The

provision in

the Bill cornes frorn the suggestion of one
of the members of the ýCommiffee, who sfafed
that he was making the suggestion at the requesf of one of the members of f bis honourable House who had a large claim, but
who was defermined flot f0 avail hirnself of

When thaf suggesftion was made regarding Senaf ors, we

Apart from the saving which is being made
of the amoiunt xvbich it was intended to give

large saving from the fact that Parliament
wili refuese to acknowledge a moral responisibliitY.
I ar n ot aware of any legisiation in
which Parliament bas acknowledged such a
responsibility, it would have been a new departure.and any such action would be opening
a ocxv door. It would, iî'st of ill. be in ci cfiiet with the principle embodied in the Bank,

JUNE 19, 1925
(a short time ago, when he said the liquidator
estimated that $3,000,000 would cover the
needy cases. Surely the liquida-tor cannot have
any knowledge of what are needy cases and
what are flot; therefore he could flot make an
esqtimate unless it ivas based on the 35 per
cent payment.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: 0f course we think
that in fixing the amount we make lit large
enough to cover ail emergencies. Presumably the discretion given to the Commissioner
will be proper-ly exercised a.nd the principle
of the Bill acted upon.
Hon. Mr. ROBE RTSON:
Then it is
obviously my honourable friend's expectation
that the amýount named in the second section
of the Bill will flot aIl be used.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I hope it will not.
Hon. G. G. POSTER: The impression of
the liquidator was that $.00,00O or $3,000,000
or $4,000,000 would square everything. We
adopted $3,000,000 in order to make sure that
there would be enough to pay ail the
exp enses.
Hon. Mr. DA.\"DURA.ND:
According to
what my honourahle friend says, even if the
Commissioner alýlowed aIl the claims outside
of those that are barred, $3,000,00 would
cover the amount?
Hon. G. G. FOSTER: Everything, ineluding tihe expenses.
The ameodmenet was agreed to.
On section 3-creditors for money or
deposits, or current accounts, defined:
The Hon. the CHAIRM AN: In the last
line of the clause as printed in the Bill,
after the word "co]leoted" insert "by the
bank."
The amendment was agreed to, and section
asi amended was agreed to.
On section 4-no payment to person or
Government entitled to charge upon assets,
or bank or banking correspondent:
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I ask my
honourable friend on what principle the Committee ibased their decision thaît ahl these
associations and fraternal societies should be
exempted?
Hon. Mr. BElIQUE: Because it le presumed that, the loas to each of the members
would be very small, if it la distrihuted
amon-g such a large number of persons in
each society.

611

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That may be
truie in some cases, but the amounts in the
aggregate in some instances are quita large.
I would point out, for example, the municîpality of Fernie, which I unsderstand sustained a loes of over $100,000.
Hon. Mr. BEýIQUTE: I would add that this,
strict]y speaking, would not be niecess-ary.
They woul.d be excluded because of noýt comrnýg within the prineiple of tfihe Bill, the
principle being that indemnity is grantedonly
in case of need. A municipality cannot be in
need, within the meaning of the Bill.
New paragraphis (c), (d) and (e) were
agýrced to.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: It is proposed to add as paragraph (f) :
(f) any Senator or Member of tbe House of Corninons of Canada.

Then the words:
Any question arisîng under thua section shall be detsTmrnPd by the Commissioner, and bis decision shall
b" final.

The amendment was agreed to.
Clause A, subsections 1 and 2, were agreed
to.
On Clause A, subsection 3:
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The honourable
leader of the Opposition (Hon. Sir James
Lougheed) suggested that it might be better
f0 authorize the Commissioner to delegate
his powers. The Committee did flot think
that it would be desirable to do that.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: 1 think the honourable
leader on this side will waive his objection
about that.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
la it,
understood that the Commissioner will go,
throughouit Canada and settle those c1aims'ý
That is the only way he can do it effectively.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The Commissioner,
as a Judge of the Excehequer Court, bas foi'
many years been holding court in aIl parts of
Canada. 1 have no doubt he will go to, any
places where there are a large number of
dlaims.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I sbould
like to see him go inro ail those centres personally to settle the claims.
H-on. Mr. BEIQUE. Yes, I think tihat
would be better than to delegate his powers.
Subisection 3 of clause A was agreed to.

The title is

This Act may be cited as the Home Bank Certain

The title as amended was agreed to.
Mr. ChairHon. G. D. ROBERTSON:
man, I would like to ask my honourable
friend whether or not the Commissioner
would have discretion in certain cases. A
depositor of $500 or less will get an adjustment without delay :r cost. I brought to
the attention of the Hause the other evening
a case of which I had heard and known nothing until I received the letter. A cripple who
had a deposit of $2,800 was left without a
dollar. Such a depositor may reside a considerable distance from the point at which
the Commissioner is sitting, and it might
be difficult, îndeed impossible, to obtain the
necessary expense money and to appear before the Commissioner.
He does
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
not have to appear.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The suggestion
I wanted to make was that it ought to be
made clear that the Commissioner should ex.ercise discretion in cases of that kind and
.should make it possible for a person in those
circumstances to appear before him.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:
tc do that.

He has very wide

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
members of this Chamber have still in mind
the trend of ftie discussion on the motion
for the second reading. I took occasion to
say that the Gosvernment had simply given
ffect to the unanimous resolution of a Comnittee of tie House of Commons. which de'lared that the depositors of the Home Bank
and a moral claim in equity, that, the resolution having been adoptcd by the House of
Commons, a mandate was gisven-I would
say, somewhat imperatively-to the executive

h'eneen the varous classes of cases when

Mr. BEIQUE.

proposad a sum which would provide 35 per
cent to each depositor.
Now the Senate suggests that the principle
be altered. It has a right to do so. We are
here to agree or to disagree with the decision
of the other Chamber. The Senate is proceeding on other lines. In the first place. it
rejects the claim of a moral obligation. Secondly, if attempts ta cover only the cases
that are in need of compassion. Since this is
the prnciple underlying the work of this
Chamber. I would have preferred to see it
carried right through, and I suggested that
the Commissioner should examine into all
cases and apply that principle to each. The
Special Committee which prepared these
amendments, and the Committee of the
whole, have decided otherwise. They make
an arbitrary rule that all depositors having
$500 or less to their credit shall receive 35
per cent To that extent, I feel, we recognize
the principle, which was contained in the Bill
as presented to the House, of granting a uniform rate. The Special Committee had its
reasons for fixing that limit and declaring that
ail depositors of $500 or less should receive the
35 per cent. I have no mandate. I have not
had an opportunity of consulting my colleagues on this matter. I will leave this
work of the Senate as it is, reserving my
ridht to express the opinion of the Cabinet,
if it is confirmed by a resolution of the Commous. Without further protest we will let this
Bill go to the other Chamber in the hope
that it may meet with the approval of the
Cabinet and 'he House of Commons.
I would like to
Hon. Mr. McHUGH:
say just a word, Mr. Chairman. In the distribution of the 25 per cent that was paid the
depositors before, the liquidator instructed the
Bank to pay the amounts on presentation
of the bank books. Now, it would save a
great deal of trouble on the part of the Liquidator, or the Commissioner, in going around,
if amounts un to $500 were paid in that way.
I understand you are going to pay all depositors but ee, 'o the extent of $500. Why
could thiat not be done through the banks?
I might say that the Senator who had a deposit in tiat bak spoke only for himself, and
not for membcrs of Parliament generally who
are in the category of those who are excluded.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: There need be no misapprehenmon about that. I am sure the Conmissioner and Liquidator will arrange to facilitote the paymont of those claiims without any
ltrlole
alllt bec
tley are recognized by
the ill.

RAILWAY FREIGHT RATES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. R. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 181, an Act to amend the
Railway Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this Bill
has for its object the granting to the Board of
Railway Commissioners the necessary authority to fix and enforce a fair and reasonable
rate structure for the Dominion of Canada.
The members of this honourable House are
all aware of the situation which has developed
lately in connection with the enforcement of the
rates which were granted by what is called
the Crowsnest Pass agreement of 1897. Parliament decided last year that there should
be no further suspension of that Act, and the
result of that decision was that the Canadian
Pacifie Railway complied with the will of
Parliament according to what it thought to
be its rights under the Act, and limited its
obligations to that railway system as it stood
in 1897. The provinces affected lodged a
complaint with the Railway Board, and asked
that the rates be extended to the entire
Canadian Pacific Railway system, and not
confined to the limited area that that system
covered in 1897.

f

Members of this Chamber are all aware of
the decision which followed. The Railway
Board decided that it was not bound by the
agreement of 1897-that its powers under the
Act in 1903 superseded that Act, and it refused the application of the petitioners.
There was an appeal from that decision to
the Supreme Court under two heads: first,
as to the validity and binding nature of the
Act of 1897, the Crowsneet Pass agreement,
and as to the extent to which it should be
applied. The Supreme Court decided that
the Railway Board had erred in declaring that
it was not bound by the agreement of 1897,
and that that contract still held and was to
be taken into consideration in the exercise
by the Board of its powers as to the fixation
of rates. On the second point the Supreme
Court declared that the Canadian Pacifie
Railway was right in its interpretation of the
Act, and was not bound to extend the privileges that accrued to the people of the western provinces beyond the Canadian Pacifie
system as it existed in 1'897.
The result of that decision was to create
confusion and chaos throughout the land,
and it bename apparent that something should
be done to remedy the situation; therefore
the Government brought to Parliament the
present Bill. There are but two sections in
the Bill:
(5) Notwithstanding the provisions of section three
the powers given to the Board under this Act to fix,
determine and enforce just and reasonable rates, and
to change and alter rates as changing conditions or cost
of transportation may from time to time require;
shall not be limited or in any manner affected by the
provisions of any Act of the Parliament of Canada, or
by any agreement made or entered into pursuant thereto,
whether general in application or special and relating
on'ly to any specific railway or railways, and the Board
shall not excuse any charge of unjust discrimination,
whether practised against shippers, consignees, or
localities, or of undue or unreasonable preference, on
the ground that such discrimination or preference is
justified or required by any agreement made or entered
into by the company: Provided that, notwithstanding
anything in this subsection contained, rates on grain
and flour shall, on and from the date of the passing
of this Act, be governed by the provisions of the agreement made pursuant to chapter five of the statutes of
Canada, 1897, but such rates shall apply to al snob
traffic moving from all points on all aines of railway
west of Fort William to Fort William or Port Arthur
over all lines now or hereafter constructed by any company subject to the jurisdiction of Parliamnent.
(6) The Board shah not excuse any charge of unjust
discrimination, whether practised against shippers, consgnees, or localities or of undue or unreasonable preference, respecting rates on grain and flour, governed
by the provisions of chapter five of the statutes of
Canada, 1897, and by the agreement made or entered
into pursuant thereto, within the territory in the imnied;ately preceding subsection referred to, on the
ground that such discrimination or preference is justified or required by the said Act or by the agreement
made or entered into pursuant thereto.
4. To remove doubts the tolls specified in tariffs filed
at any time prior to the passing of this Act, with the

SENATE
Board in areordance with the provisions of The Railxsav Art, 1919, are and shall be deemned lawful tolls
o,îti! îar'ed bys tariffs filed with tise Board pursuant to
flue Act, notwitlistanding the provisions of any Act
or anv agreement, and notwithstanding any judgments
or orders mtade, at any time prior te the passing of this
Art. with regard thereto.

The limitation of the powers of the Board
applies to, the rates to be fixed on foeur and
grain, which stili remain under the operation
of the Crowsnest rates agreement.
1 beIiev e that this legisiation will appeai to
the jigment of thais Chamber and to the
cotuntry generally. The Railway Board lias
heen constituted specialiy to control thec administration of tlic railways as to rates, and
it is especially fitted to fix those rates-. I
do nlot suppose that any mnember of this
Chamber would venture to express the opinion
that we are in a better position than the
Board of Raiiway ýCommissioners to apply
that Act. I think we have reason te, be proud
of the work performed by that Board.
I mav be told that if tlie Board lias ail the
neeesSary qualificaiions to, do týhat vworlq.
there is no reason why it should be haimpered
in the least in exercising thit funaction from
A to Z. My answer to that is thut there

Hon. J. D. REID: Honourable gentlemen.
I woiild like to say a few words on this Bill.
In the first place, I oblect that a Bill of such
great, importance shouild hoe hroîtgit down to
thie Sonate at sudsic a late hour. This Bill
affects almost every citizen of Canada from
the Atlantic to tise Pacifie. and yet it mulst
go tlîrougi wsitisoît the members of the Senate
hafving an opportunity of gettiog it before our
Railway Committee, svhere it should go. and
hax ing evidence broîîght before us in order
tisit we might vote on it inteliigently.
Wriri regard to tise question of freight rates
throughout the Dominsion, 1 agree to tison
hting placed cntircl 'v in tise hands of the
Boarud of Railssay Comnsissioners, and I do
flot tisini I ssoiild hsave ,îny qtiarrelisvitls tis
Bill if it SiliiîlY allowp d th e whole rate question0 to he takenr up andi settled by tisat Board.
Thte lionotiralale leader of the Gos-ernment

East siiotilc gise anti take a little. in ordc r
ils pronsote grext

to hasve the very opposite effeet. Tise farmers
of the West are given special -freight rates
on wiseat and flour from the West to For,
Williaîm and Port Arthsur, and tise honourable
gentleman and his Government take great
credit for that so far as Alberta, Saskatchewan
and Manitoba are concerned. The honourab!le
leader speaks of Vancosiver as one of thegreatest ports in the West. Tîsat is where
tise grain is going; but tisis Bill does ot
provide that tise farmers of Manitoba, Alberta
and Saýskatchew:an shah bhave equal rates fro i
tsose tisree provincees to the Pacifie coast, if
grain cao ho shipped ciseaper to Vancouver
and around bx' the Panamsa Canal. Is tisat
not iikclY to caus-e --rife anît trouble in

SENATE

If there is an amendment, I hope the Government will see that it is presented in the Senate
first, so that we may have time to give it
proper consideration. If it is introduîced here,
I am satisfied that the Senate can put it into
proper shape-yes, much better shape than
this Bill is in now-and it will go to the
Commons in plenty of time for them to do any
further work on it that they may think
necessary.
Hon. C. E. TANNER: Honourable gentlemen, I realize that at this stage of the Session
there would be no profit in prolonging this
discussion, but I wish to associate myself with
the remarks of the honourable member from
Grenville (Hon. Mr. Reid) so far as these relate to the province from which I come.
I
desire to go on record as protesting against
the incorporation in this Bill of a specific
rate for Western provinces.
Personally I
should favour turning over the whole question
of railway rates to the Railway Commissioners
and giv ing them a free hand.
But the Governrment are not doing that. They are choosing out three of the provinces-against which
I have nothing whatever to say-and giving
them favourable rates on their products. The
ground, as I understand it, upon which those
special rates are made, is that the grain crop
is a very important factor in the prosperity of
the West.
With that statement I have no
quarrel; but I want to say that proportionally
the products of the province from which I
come are of just as much importance to Nova
Scotia as the products raised in the Prairie
Provinces are to the West.
Consequently I
say that if this Parliament is going to favour
one province because of the importance of its
products. logically it should favour other provinces which are proportionally as much intc:ested in their products.
Coal and fish are
the life of Nova Scotia.
If the Western provInces are entitled to special rates for grain,
then I say Nova Scotia is entitled to special
rates for coal, fish, lumber and its other products.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Honourable gentlemen, I want to point out to the House
that this Bill makes no provision with respect to the a-ereement that was entered
into by the province of Manitoba with
the Canadian Northern Railway in 1901.
The consideration of the contract was that
the province should hand over to the Canadian Northern Railwav the leases. for 99
years, which they had obtained from the
Northern Pacifie. The Northern Pacific had
at that time built some branch lines into
Manitoba. I need not go into the history
of the matter. The Government, instead of
Hon. My. REID.

granting further aid, took over those lines
on lease for 99 years. Then they assigned
the leases to the Canadian Northern under a
ýprovincial statute, which was ratified, I believe, by the Dominion Government, and
which provided for the control of rates. It
has been argued throughout the country that
the Railway Act superseded the contract
entered into between the Manitoba Government and the Canadian Northern. The province of Manitoba was not satisfied with that
contention; so it took the matter to the
courts. The case followed the usual course
and came before the Supreme Court of
Canada, which held that the Railway Act did
supersede the contract. The Government of
Manitoba appealed to the Privy Council, and
the appeal is pending. It will probably be
decided in October.
One of the objections that I have to this
Bill is that it does not save the rights of
Manitoba pending that appeal. Surely honourable gentlemen will at once realize the
justice of the position, that as the case is
pending before the Privy Council and is to
be decided in two or three months, it is
neither just nor fair that any Act of Parliament should wipe out their rights. I mereiy
mention this now, on the second reading of
the Bill, but I intend to move an amendment
when the Bill goes to Committee.
Hon. J. G. TIRRIFF: Honourable gentlemen, a great deal bas been said about this
Bill giving special privileges to the West in
the way of freight rates. I wish to point out
that this Bill, instead of giving special privileges, is taking away privileges that were
given to us in the West by Act of Parliament. One item, wheat and fleur, is left as it
was, but twelve or thirteen other items are
cancelled. I do net sec that that is giving us
very much. Furthermore, why should not the
Prairie provinces get rates on wheat and flour
going to the Pacific equal to the rates on
those commodities when shipped via Montreal? Why should all the West be discriminated against? Why should net Vancouver be
given the saime rates as Fort William, for the
same product? This Bill will cause a great deal
of dissatisfaction in British Columbia, as well
as in the three Prairie provinces. There will
be continued agitation with respect to the
discrimination made against Vancouver; and
the agitation in the three Prairies provinces
because of the rernoval of privileges that we
received under Act of Parliament, with respect to the items other than grain and fleur,
will be very much increased. There ought to
be the same freight rates from the prairies
eastward and westward. Vancouver is coming

JUNE 20, 1925
now to take a large portion of the wheat
traffic to the Old Country and to foreign
markets from ail of Alberta and from the
western half of Saskatchewan. It will take
I imagine, close to half of the wheat that is
produced on the prairies and until the rates
are made equal West and East there wilJ be
dissatisfaction. You had only to read the
press of the West during the past month or
two in order to see the dissatisfaction that
exists and will continue until those rates are
equalized. You cannot get away frem that.
The country bought and paid for the concessions in what are known as the Crowsnest
rates. The Canadian Pacifie Railway received
over $3,000,000 in cash subsidy in consideration of the maximum rates fixed by the
original Crowsnest agreement, and the Canadian Pacifie Railway afterwards, of their own
accord, reduced the rates. Now, all that we
are retaining out of that agreement is the
rate on one product in the form of either
wheat or flour, going one way. It is retained
only to the extent of one-hadf; for we have
all been expecting that probably half of our
crops would go by the western route. It
would be of a great advantage to the Prairie
provinces to have equal rates to the West.
Vancouver is an all-year port. If in the
present season the favourable weather continues for the next six weeks, there will be
the greatest congestion that there ever has
been, and if we could ship westward as cheaply
as we can eastward, the congestion would be
relieved. The port of Vancouver handled last
year and the year before around 50,000,000
bushels, and with its great elevator accommodation for wheat, and the fact that it is
an ocean port open the year round, the
danger of a blockade of any kinid would be
obviated.
This Bill will, also, as my honourable
friend from Grenville pointed out, discriminate against the Lower Provinces. There is
no question of that. They are entitled to
consideration.
We have hardly had a chance to consider
what the effects of this measure are going
to be.
Another Bill that means a great deal to
the West is the Grain Act. I do not suppose
any honourable member of this House has
had time to look at that Bill. I received a
copy on my desk a day or two ago, but
the Senate has been so busy, in these dying
days of the Session, that I have not read a
single cause of that Bill--do not know what
is in it and have no possible chance to study
its effect. It is pitchforked in to us, to be
passed. I say we ought to take my honourable friend the leader of the Government

617

at his bluff, and if he wants to have us consider it for three weeks, we ought to be
willing to stay here and consider it for that
length of time, and let the House of Commons, whose fault it is, stew in their own
juice for a little while.
Hon. Mr. DANDTJRAND:
I will make
an offer to my honourable friend. The Grain
Act has not yet passed the House of Commons,
but copies have been distributed here. I
presume it concerns particularly the representatives of the Western provinces.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Yes, largely.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
If these honourable gentlemen will make it their business
between now and, say, Monday eveningHon. Mr. REID: Working on Sunday?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Well, instead
of playing golf. If they will make it their
business to read that Bill, which concerns
them particularly, and if, having examined it,
they return to this Chamber on Monday
evening and say that it ought to be passed
by Parliament, the other members will accept
their judgment.
Hon. Mr. REID: I do not know about
that. It affects us in Ontario too.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Then my honourable

friend

will

perhaps

the Bill

himself between now and Monday evening.
If the honourable members who are most
concerned in this Bill think that it needs
serions consideration and comnlete overhauling by a Committee of this House, I will
not hesitate one moment to agree to send it
over to next Session.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: May I ask if the
word "grain" covers the coarser grains? Or
what is it intended to cover?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My honourable friend is very likely in ·he same position
t
as I am-I have not yet read the Bill.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I have read this
Bill.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF:
My honourable
friend the leader of the Government makes a
suggestion. Well, if the members from the
West were all as clever and as able as my
honourable friend is, they might, between no"
and Monday night come to understand the
Bill and find out whether it was satisfactory
or not. Speaking for myself, I have not that
abiiity. If I were to spend every moment
froin now to Monday night on the Bill, I
would still have a grea-t deal to learn about

measure of this kind, is that it is a'bsoilutely
nuecessaýry, in order to ooordinate freight rates
through .this country, to ignore every coutract
that has hithert-o ibeen made. To my -mid
there is no other principie than can justify
this BiVIi. The province of Mianitohba made an
agreement with the Canadian Northern, for
whýioh it -gave subéstantial consideration; yet
even before th-at agreemenut is judiged hy the
final 'tribunal, this Bill wipes it out. The onily
thing that is ieft of adlil
the agreements whioh
were mnade, is a part of an agreement for
which the western provinces have given no
consideration.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Does ýthe honourable
g-entleiman think thait t:he 'Governmentar
justified in wiiping out that agreement which
Manitoba made, pIedging ail the resources of
Manitoba to the Canadian North-ern?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: No, I disapprove
of that enitireily, and 1 say -that if meritorjous
agreetmentis of tha.t kind are wiped ouit, this
Government has no right to maintain another
agreement for which. no suph conisideration
was given.
Hon. Mr. SEARPE: But the Goveroment
gave the Canadian Pacific Railway $3,000,'000
or $4,000,000 fior the concession of the Crwsnest agreement.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I must apologize
for being obscure in my danguage. Without
any d'oubt the people of Canada have given
the C.P.R. ýcon.sidenation for the C-rowsneet
Pass agreemen.t. That, of course, is the reason
why the whoie country bas some riight to complain. The people of Canada gave th, C.P.R.
a subsidy. and it is the pe-opie of Canada who
tc-day releiase them. To my imid that is
very different fromn the position Manitoba
hoiýds to-day on her own speciai agreement,
for it was flot the people -of Canada who gave
the Canaditan Nort-hern the special suibsidieis
and advantages contained in that agreement,
but Manitoba. I rise in protest because I
believe those rights are sacred, and if you
violate th-em in Manit-oba you can violate
tbemn in an-y province.
The Maritime Provinces at the preisent tirne
constitute the trageidy of Canada. They have
a olaim on uËs,and in the matter of transportation -there is no -part of the corunitry that
has as sacred a claim. The nid tragedy of
history in the time when w'ar was bachbarous,
when a part of tîheir population was removed
by the hands of eoidiers, is being re-enacted
by the poiicy we are f4cliowing in our treatment of th.e Ma-riime Provinces. The unly
differeýnce is -that now bunge-r and need and
not the banda of soidiers are driving the

population out of the Maritime Provinces.
These provinces have -a efaim with regard to,
tran,9portaition prior to thiat of any ipeople in
the liand, because .they did not, enter Confederation without an absolute promise that
satisfactory transpoi4tation would be given to
tbem. In my opiniion, the tragedy in the
Maritime Provinces is in great part due to
the fa.ct that -th-ey have n-eyer had transp-ortation stch as wouid compensate theen for
aban.doning the trade routes with the United
States that made them prosperous before
Confederation.
In what position are we to-.day? The Government biindiy sets aside agreements whîch
shouid binsi it andi retains the Crowsnest Pass
for a portion of the people onily. It maintains
that privilege. knowing tha.t it is going to
cogt the whole country, and more particuiiarly
the ipeopie of the Maritime Provinces, a large
amounit of money in extra taxes.
To my mnd, the principle of this Bill is
false, first, because it vioiates agreements that
shouid be considered sacred; secondly, because
it preserves under a speciai priviiege oniy a
portion of one agreement; thirdiy, because
the resuit wiil be additional losses to our
raiiwav, and therefore the imposition of unjust taxes all through the land, especiaiiy on
the people of the Maritime Provinces, who
have neyer received due consideration fromn
the Confederation, which they entered on
special conditions.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Honourable gentlemen,
I wish to protest against this Bill. I do not
consider that, as framed, it is at ail aiong the
right lines. Manito~ba entered into an agreement some years ago, putting up ah bher resources for it, and the Dominion Government ratified that agreement.
Now this
Government wipcs it out entireiy, and says
wc in Manitoba have no rights at all. I
protest in the strongest way ag-ainst this Bi!l
going throuh.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Honourable gentlemen, it is not news to the honourabie leader
of this House that this Bill as presented is
an offence to pubic sentiment in British
Columbia. The Government of which he is
a meinher has been memorialized in great
detail and very persistentiy for years by
the Boards of Trade and other spokesmen for
the business interests of British Columýbia,
demanding equalization of rates. Not ýonly
so, but there have been camped at the door
of this Government for months its political
friends from British Columbia, demanding in
thunder tones that the equalization to which
British Columbia is entitled shahl be given
to ber.

620

SENATE

The answer to that demand comes in this
Bill, which not only perpetuates an injustice
to British Columbia with respect to the old
Crowsnest Pass agreement, so far as freight
rates are concerned, but extends it over a
large number of points not provided for in
the original agreement, thereby 'aggravating
the injustice to the trade and prospects of
that province.
I would remind the honourable gentleman
and his Government that British Columbia
has a specific agreement in the terms of
union with Canada, whereby she is guaranteed equal treatment with any of the other
provinces of Canada in regard to all public
services. There seems to be no room for
doubt that the discrimination effected by this
Bill. providing for transportation from the
interior provinces of the West towards the
Atlantic at a lower rate than can be secured
from those provinces to the Pacific, is a
direct violation of the agreement with British
Columbia.
I would like to know what reason. if any,
exists for not providing in the Bill for an
extension of the Crowsnest agreement as to
flour and wheat to traffic westbound to British
Columbia, as well as traffir eastbound to Fort
William.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: There is an aspect of this case that should not be overlooked. The Crowsnest agreement had pronounced usefulness when it was first inaugurated, but since it was entered into in 1897
great eommunties have grown up in the province of 1ber:a we'hich to-day rcce:ve no bcnefit at all from that agreement, while the enforcement of the rates under it, especially in
the northern part of Alberta, causes chaos
and confusion, as well as rank discrimination
against whole new communities in that part
of the country. This is so obvious to everyone that some change or revision, some attempt to deal with a serious situation, is
necessary, and this is the Government proposal.
I join with those who ask the Covernment
why there has not been the same consideration for grain and flour shipped westward
as there is for those products shipped eastward. This is the Government's solution of
a serious situation. If we by any chance
should reject this Bill, the situation resulting in the northern part of Alberta would be
infinitely more serious than it will be under
the Bill if we pass it. I want to put that
point of view before the House.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: As a Maritime man I
cannot resist again calling the attention of
the House to one or two features which
lion. Mr, TAYLOR.

vitally affect the three Maritime Provinces. It
is net necessary for me to refer to the very
serious condition which already exists in those
provinces, and which has been so well described
by the honourable member from Quebec province (Hon. Mr. Beaubien). We had a very
practical and emphatic demonstration of that
condition this year when an enormous delegation, representing practically all the business
interests of those three provinces, appeared in
Ottawa.
It is worth while to call attention again to
the implied agreement at Confederation by
which we were to be given adequate railway
communication and, transportation facilities
in consideration of abandoning our natural
market. For a short time the Maritime Provinces, through the Intercolonial railway. enjoyed a reascnable degree of traffic facilities;
but since the days when Andrew G. Blair
was Minister of Railways, we have net enjoyed what is due to us. On the contrary,
traffic arrangements have been continual'ly
onerating against the Maritime Provinces and
slighting them.
In the Confederation pact we had net
only an implied but an emphatic agreement
that we were to be given reasonable transportien facilities. I understand that this Bill
is an effort to give the Railway Board an
opportunitv to adjuzt freigtht rates on an
equitable basis: but there is onr very serion, joker in it, and that is, that by the premi-e- on which i- is based it allows favoureble consideration to a certain portion of the
pnrt of Canada on grain and flour.
mstern
If thooe comimodities are omitted from the
f the Railway Board an addidiction
t'nul hurden is immediate!y imposed on al
the rest of the country. and in the conditions which now exist in the Maritime Provinces a very little additional burden will be
the last straw that may break the camel's
back.
But my honHon. Mr. DANDTRAND:
ourable friend has 'he burden already.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Bu' we are trying
to get rid of it. That is what we are asking
for; but you are net proposing to get rid
of it: you are leaving it there. My honourable friend, in introducing this Bil. said
there were certain contrats by which the
Government was campelled to abide. All
right, let us abide by them. The Parliament
of Canada, under the leadership of a Government of which the present Government is the
successor. gave a grant of $30,000,000 to the
Canadian Northern Railway, with an absoIite guarantee that every bit of freight which
originated on that road should go out through

JUNE 20, 1925
Canadian ports. This implied that during
the seven or eight winter months the exports
were to go out through Maritime Province
ports. If this Bill is based on the principle
that we are going to stand on agreements made
by the Government, then I call on my honourable friend the leader in this House te embody
in this Bih the same condition embodied in
that agreement, so that in future all the products cf Canada, or originating in Canada from
any source whatever, shal go out through
Canadian ports. This Bill* does not reaffirm
tîat condition in the agreement with the Canadian Northern, which has never been carried
out.
In addition, if any favourable conditions
are given to any part of western Canada, similarly favourable conditions should be given
te the Maritime Provinces; because I say,
with tþe greatest regret, that no part of
Canada to-day is suffering such financial and
commercial stagnation as are those provinces,
the first and greatest cause of that condition
being the excessive transportation rates both
for freight and express.
I trust that before this Bill passes, the
honourable leader of the Goverument will
see that the rights of the minority-because
we are a minority-are protected, and that
justice is done to the Maritime Provinces
as well as te that part of western Canada
which is favoured by these special provisions.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen seem te be in absolute ignorance
of the action of the Government, or of the
Committee of the Privy Council which sat
in judgment on these matters, on an appeal
from the decision of the Railway Commissioners. They seem te ignore the fact that
a judgment has been entered which contains
directions te the Railway Board in the examination and determination of the proper rates
te be fixed when they try te equalize those
rates.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: With a few reserva-

tions.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: With the reservation of the maintenance of the maximum
rate on flour and wheat. I am. ready te defend that, and if there is anyone who wants
te challenge that advantage given the western
provinces, if he is se sinclined he may do se
in Committee, and we will divide on that.
When it comes te British Columbia and
the Maritime Provinces, the Cabinet has been
as solicitous of the interests of those two
large areas in the country as any honourable
menber of this Chamber can be; yet it must
hold the balance even, and must see that the

621

Railway Commissioners are vested with suffioient powers to do what is right in the equalization of rates. It has given directions te the
Railway Commission, which are contained in
the Order in Council P. C. 886, of June 5,
1925. I will not read the two pages containing a review of the judgment of the Supreme
Court on the legal interpretation of the contract, but I will read the conclusions:
The Committee are of the opinion that the policy of
equalization of freight rates should be recognized ta
the fullest possible extent as being the only means
of dealing equitably with all parts of Canada, and
as being the method best calculated ta facilitate the
interchange of commodities between the various portions of the Dominion, as well as the encouragement
of industry and agriculture and the development of
export trade.
The Committee are further of the opinion that ta
give effect ta this policy, and considering the submissions made by counsel and important trade organizations representing different provinces and localities
in the Dominion as ta the disadvantages that would be
suffered by such provinces and localities by any partial
or incomplete consideration of the freight rate structure,
a thorough and complete investigation of the whole subjeet of railway freight rates in the Dominion should be
carried out by the Board of Railway Commissioners,
the body constituted by Parliament with full powers
under statute ta fix and contral railway rates.
•
The Committee are further of the opinion that as the
production atd expert of grain and flour forma one
of the chief assets of the Dominion, and in order ta
encourage the funther development of the great graingrowing provinces of the West, on which development
the future of Canada in large measure depends, it is
desirable that the maximum cost of the transportation
of these products should be determined and known,
and therefore are of opinion that the maximum estahlished for rates on grain and flour, as at present in
force under the Crowsnest Pass Agreement, should net
be exceeded.
The Committee are further of the opinion that,
before such investigation is undertaken it is essential
ta ensure that the provisions of the Railway Act ln
reference ta tariffs and tolls, and the jurisdiction of the
Board thereunder, be unfettered by any limitations
other than the provisions as ta grain and flour hereinbefore mentioned.
The Committee therefore advise that the Board be
directed ta make a thorough investigation of the rate
structures of railways and railway companies subject
ta the jurisdiction of Parliament, with a view ta the
estnblishment of a fair and reasonabte rate structure,
which will, under substantially similar circumstances and
'Conditions, be equal in its application ta aill persans and
localities, so as te permit of the freest possible interchange of comamodities between the various provinces
and territories of the Dominion and the expansion
of its trade, both foreign and domestic, having due
regard ta the needs of its agricultural and other basic
industries, and in particular ta:
(a) The claim asserted on behalf of the Maritime
Provinces that they are entitled ta the restoration of
the rate basis which they enjoyed prior te 1919;

That is a direction te the Board of Railway Commissioners.
(b) The encouragement of the movement of traffic
through Canadian ports;

That is an answer te the voice I have just
heard.
(c) The increased traffic westward and eastward
through Pacifie Coast ports owing ta the expansion

Rien. R. WATSON:
Mr. Cbaiurman, this
niatter ef the Croxxsnt'st ratus is ont' that Las
intt'rtsted Parliamient, and particularly tht'
W est. for -orne years, and I have' been familiar
xih the' legfislatien on tht' stîbjeut. botL in
Maniteba and in tht' Federai Parliament at

JUNE 20, 1925
Ottawa. I remember that ahout six years
ago, when it was suggested that the Crowsnest
rates should be wiped out, objection was
raised and the propoqsed amend'ment was withdrawn by the Government. In the following
year -it was rte-ubînitted, after a canvass had
heen made, and the Senate and Commons
passed a Bill to, suspend, under the War
Measures Act, the operation of the Crowsnest
Pass rates for three years. That suspension
continued until two years ago.
TheCrowsQnest bargain was flot a charitable
affair at ail. As a matter of right, the people
of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta were
guaranteed those rates away baok in 1897.
At that time the C.P.R. wanted. to extend
their road into the Crowsnest Pass. and they
came to the Federal Government and received
aid in the form of a bonus to the extent of
312 millions, for the purpose of co'nstructing
t heir line, on condition, as part of the contract, that fixed rates were to be given to the
company.
Conditions hav'e changed to such an extent
ail over the world, particulaly in Western
Canada, that an adju.stment of rates is ne-cessary. It is claimed by somne honourable gentlemen that Manitoba, Alberta, and Saskatchewan aie getting too much under this agree.ment. One change effected by this Bill
which is beneficial to the West, and which
removes the objection of my honourahie
friend from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach),
is that rates whi*ch previous1y applied only
to the roads constructed along the southern
boundary of the Province, are to be extended
to ail prairie ues.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBAOH:
clear on that point?

You are quite

Hon. Mr. WATSON: Yes.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Your leader supports that view?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Hon. Mr. WATSON

Yes.

(reading):

Provided that, notwithstand.ng anything ln this subsection containeil, rates on grain and flour shall, on and
froin the date of the passing of th-is Act, be governed
by the provisions of the agreement made pursuant to
cliepter five of the .statutes of Canada, 1897, but such
rates shall apply to ail such traffie moving from ail
points on ail lines of railway west of Fort William to
Fort William or Port Arthiar over all lines now or
hereafter constructed by any company subjeot to the
jurisdirtion of Parlianient.

That makes it perfectly clear that the
whole of the West is to have the benefit of
the Crowsnest rates on grain and flourgrain, of course, including wheat, oats and
barley; and with that provision in the Act,
we shall be in a btter position than we were

0

621ý

previously- Therefore, as far as I am concerned, I withdrawv any objections I had to
this Bill.
The suggestion las been made that Manitoba has at present an appeal pending.
It
has; but in my judgment, that appeal will
not prevail. The members of the Manitoba
Government came to Ottawa in 1901 or 1902,
1 think, and ask-ed that those railways should
be put tîinder the control of the Railway Commission.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: No, you are wrong.
Hon, Mr. WATSON:
I may be wrong,
but 1 am inelined to think the courts wil
bear out th-at contention anyhow.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: They may, but if you
look up the debates of that day You will
find that Sir Clifford Sifton and others made
it very clear that the Railway Commission had
no jurisdiction over the deal that was made
by the Manitoba Government.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: I know.
very aîctiv e part at the time-

I took a

Hon. Mr. SHARPE: I do not douht it.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: -and I opposed thte
action of the Manitoba Government in handingt the question over to the Railway Commission. However, that is a bygone, and
whether or not the contention of the Province
of Manitoba prevails, I think that the daims,
spart from grain and foeur, would make very
Jittle differenýce, and that we are getting a
îeal benefit under this Act.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: May I ask what, in
the huonourahle gentleman's opinion, is the
advantage that accrues to the farmers of
northern Alberta by reason of the concessions
extended, when. as a matter of fact, the new
route to the Pacifie coast is noýw open -and
will divert ail] traflic originating in Alberta
to the Pacifie Coast?
Hon. Mr. WATSON:
The advantage is
thîs.
It bas been held that the agreement
applied only to the railways that were constructed in 1897.
Now its terms are exte'nded
to aIl the railroads i0 Manitoba, Alberta, and
Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: 0f what advantage is
it to a railroad in northern Alberta if ail its
grain trafflc is going to be diverted to the
West?
Hon. Mr. WATSON: It will not hurt them
even if the grain is going to Fort William.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Do 1 understand that
my honourable friend would vote for this
Bill and wipe out al the rights the Manitoba

Government had?

I am curieus te know what the argument of the Government is in that matter.

that there would be a fair interchange of products between their Province and the other
Provinces.
Tbey were promised a railway
that would bind them to the Dominion, and
they say that under the terras or the spirit
of the Act they should net be discriminated
against.
Well, this means the flxing of rates.
Shall we here, in our wisdomn, and with our
meagre knowledge of railway traffle and railway conditions, dàecide what are fair rates to
be charged, in consideration of the general interest of the country as well as that of British
Coýlumbia?
1 believe that we are not in a
position to settie that question; and it is
because we are not in a position to tackle that
problem and te fix those rates-and the same
argument applies with regard to the Maritime
Provinco-,that we have feit, as ail thinking
men have feit, that this is flot the business
of Parliament.
Having constituted a body
of men xvho have large experience, who are surrounded by competent experts, and who can
hear ail the interested parties,, the railways,
the Provinces, the Chambers of Commerce,
and other public bodies, xve believe tbat thev
are the proper persons te determine that
mattnr.
Consequently the Gexerninent bas
feit tînt the country at large would be agreeable to helping, in the cleveopment anid prosperity cf the West, xithout xvhicha xe c innet
hope te obtain incroased population in the

This is the B:1 wbich is befoerisu.
In the
decîiin w hich the Prix-y Council rendered
in the appeal cf the tlîree Prairie prov-ines,
certain directions were given te tlae Railway
Commissioners relative te the problems cf tbe

I s-w that this Bihl
as it is sbould be accepted by tais Committee.
Hon. Mr. REID:
The honourable gentlem:an has just stated that the reason the

Bill. I -lîould like te mnako a fexv reinarks

JIJNE 20, 1925
on that aspect of the question. If it ia argued
that because the C.P.R. got a suhaidy in
1897, it should noV increase the rates, although
the cost of operation of railways bas doubled
or trebled, the same argument might apply
to all the other Provinces. For instance,' the
Canadian Pacific Railway was given a line
from Ottawa Vo Montreal; that line was
given out and ouat.
Subsidies also were
given in the Province of Ontario; but because of those su:bsidies we do not consider
that rates should not be increased. None
of us helieved that the cost of operation of
railways would increase as it has donc; in
fact, when the subsidies were given we ail believed that rates were like.ly Vo decrease.
The honourable gentleman bas also referred
to British Columbjia. I understood that the
argument of the honourable gentleman was
that we must try Vo increase the population
of the three western Provinces by giving them
lower rates on their grain to the seaboard.
Well, if I remember rightly, the distance
from Edmonton Vo the Pacifie seaboard is 600
or 700 miles; from Edmonton Vo Vhe AtlantiQ
seaboard is about 2.000 miles. The same le
true in a lesser degree of the distance from
points in Saskatchewan. Therefore, if the
honourable gentleman is sO anxious to increasb
the population and Vo encourage immigration
by iower freight rates, why does hie discriminaVe against British Columbia? If this Bill
enabled the Railway Board Vo fix lower rates
than those of the Crowsnest agreement, thus
giving cheaper transportation Vo the farmiers,
I 'would say 'chere is some argument for it;
but I cannot see how they are being favoured
by noV being allowed Vo send their products
Vo the Pacific coast on a fair basis.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Doe my hionourable friend say that hie is qualified Vo fix
that f air basis better than the Railway Board?
Hon. Mr. REID: So far as I am personally concerned, I amn free Vo admit that I
know nothing about fixing rates or running
railways; but I aay that a body lilce the Railway Board does know, and I have the greatest
confidence in them. But the Government will
not permit the Board Vo fix the rates for
those Vhree provinces Vo the seaporta on the
Pacifie, as well as Vo those on the Atlantic.
That is where I say thia Bill la unfair.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
If there fa in
this Bill -provision for the maintenance of a
lower rate on four and grain eastward, and
the Railway Board is asked Vo work towards
the equalization of rates, does noV my honourable friend believe that this will influence that
Board in fixing rates that will bý satisfactory
S--40

to British Columbia,
basis laid down in the
froen the West to the
that British Columbia
direction given to the

625
when they have the
Act indicating the rate
East? Iýt seems to me
stands to gain by the
Railway Board.

Hon. Mr. REID: In fixing rates the Railway Board must take the railways in the
whole Dominion as they stand. They cannot
say that the Crowsnest agreement gives a
certain rate; they muet fix a rate to British
Columbia pro rata, as they would to any
other place. Take Alberta: on account of the
Crowsneat agreement the rate may be 20
cents to Fort William, and another 10 cents
to Mont-real, making 30 cents, and the Railway Board may give a rate of 30 cents from
Alberta to the Pacifie coast; but there la no
advantage Vo the farmers of the West in that,
although the distance Vo the Pacific coast is
only 600 or 800 miles. If I remember rightly,
the Canadian National can take just as large
a train from Edmonton to Vancouver as it
can to Montreal; therefore the Tate should
not be discriminative. If the Board ia going
to adhere to the Crowsnest agreement, made
in 1897, when wages and cost of operation
were very low a that there would be a bas
to the railways, of course the other parts of
Canada and British Columbia would have to
bear a share of that Ioas, for the railwayc
must earn expensea. If the Government are
bound to make all the other parts of Canada
pay this expense for the purpose of assisting
the farmers in the three Prairies provinces,
why noV goa further and give the farmers the
advan-tage of the British Columbian ports?
Great stress waa laid by the leader of the
Government on the point that we must stick
to the Act of Parliament. If sa, why not
stick Vo other Arts that have been passed?
Hon. Mr. DANDUJRAND: I did not say
that at ail.
Hon. Mr. REID: The honourable gentleman stated that because the Act was passed
we must stand by it.
HIon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No; we are
recalling it.
Hon. Mr. REID: You are not recalling the
main part of it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
We are only
giving the Weat favoured treatment on four
and grain.
Hon. Mr. REID: But thi s Parliament ia
fixing the rates that were agreed Vo in 1897
on certain articles.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Two articles.

626

Hon. Mr. REID: Those are really the
main articles.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: On the contrary,
I said that it was not a contract between those
three provinces and the Canadian Pacifie
Railway; that it was a contract between the
Government of Canada and the C. P. R.,
and that the Parliament of Canada could
undo what it had done. I pleaded exactly
contrary to the argument of my honourable
friend.
Hon. Mr. REID: If it was an Act of the
Parliament of Canada, there was another
Act passed in 1911, making an arrangement
between the Canadian 'Northern Railway and
the Intercolonial for exchange of traffic.
There was another Act under which all our
traffic was to go to the Lower Provinces.
Why does not the honourable gentleman
respect those Acts, and also the agreement
in an Act that was passed in 1901 by which
the Canadian Northern, the Northern Pacifie,
the Manitoba Southwestern and others agreed
that certain rates fixed by that agreement
ghould not be exceeded? If we are to pass
this Bill on account of the Crowsnest agreement, then Parliament should not violate
those other agreements. We gave a subsidy
of $30,000,000 to the Canadian Northern Railway on the distinct understanding that every
pound of traffic that originated on those lines
should go to the eastern ports; but the Government is not seeing that that agreement is
being carried out; there is not the traffic
going to the Lower Provinces that should go.
Of course, the reason is the difference of cost
as between the ports of Halifax and St. John,
and that of Portland; but even though profit
were not made on the actual shipments, the
traffic would bring business to the people in
the Lower Provinces, and they would get a
reduced freight rate. I say that if this Bill
is submitted because of the agreement made
in 1897, we should respect the other agreements, or else not base this Bill on that
ground.
The Board of Railway Commissioners is the
proper body to fix these rates, as it has the
experience and the men who know what is
right and just; but I do not think it should
be put in such a position that in figuring out
rates for either the western or the eastern
provinces it is obliged to fix an absolute rate,
with a very small gain, or a resulting loss,
which must be made up by a charge on
other provinces. I think the Railway Board
should be in a position to do what is right
and fair for everybody.
I do not wish to put a heavier burden on
the three western provinces. I would like to
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

do better for them, if possible, but I feel that
this Bill is not in their interest. I hold that
the Government should give them the benefit
of the British Columbian ports. I believe
that this Bill will make trouble in every
province in Canada. We will have ill-feeling
on account of one province being discriminated against in the West, and others in the
East. I think the leader of the Government
should seriously consider this matter before
he asks this House to pass the Bill. We
shoukL have had an opportunity of getting it
before the Committee and thoroughly understanding it, instead of rushing it through as
we are being urged to do. If in the Committee it could be shown that it is a fair and
right measure, I would hold up both hands
for it; but I do not think it is so, and for
that reason I object.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Honourable gentlemen, I do not think that any practical
purpose can be served by discussing agreements which are wholly inapplicable to the
Vresent situation, and are for all practical
purposes as dead as Julius Caesar.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Hear, hear.
.Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The 'Government
is confronted with a very ugly situation in
this Crowsnest agreement, which on one hand,
is held to be in full force and virtue, and on
the other hand is in a position to destroy
fair competition in business in the western
provinces. The city of Edmonton, for instance, is very seriously discriminated against
by the operation of that agreement, and a
great many new communities that did not
exist when the agreement was made are in
danger of being put out of business. But
the Government must do something, and this
is the Government's proposal, and I am preparmd to vote for this Bill at any time.
I entirely agree with what every speaker
has said, that Parliament is wholly incapable
of fixing freight rates for anybody. We have
not the information or the time. On the
other hand, I am quite agreed that the Railway Board is the proper and only body to fix
rates for the whole of Canada. We will have
to resign ourselves to allowing that Board to
do that job.
The Government have seen fit in this Bill
to depart from that sound principle which
they lay down in naming two commodities
which are to have special consideration. I
fancy the Government does that as a matter
of compromise, probably with its eye on the
approaching election. One cannot blame
them so much for that, but it is distinct
departure from the general proposition that

JUNE 20, 1925
the Rallway Commission should be left to do
this job unhampered and unhindered by
legisiation of this Parldament. I fully agree
to that.
One would hope that the RaiJway Coinmission, mn going about their duties, will -have
regard for the pious hopes of the Order in
Council which has been passed by the Government. On the other hand, if that body is
as good as we think it is, it wiIl take. lot
the slightest notice of the Order in CouicIl,
but will procýeed to a solution of this question
on broad grounds in construeting a rate structure for the whole of Canada. If we get
that we cannot get anything 'better.
On the general question whether the prairie
provinces should receive special consideration,
I think I ought to point out, in defence of
that contention which we make in our part
of the world, that we dlaim. that consideration
because the three provinces are the only part
of Canada which have flot water communication. We are a solid land-locked area in the
interior of the continent; ail our transportation must be by rail; wh-ile alI the other six
provinces of Canada, not only have the advantages of water communication per se, but
also the advantagýes of the competition of
water transportation. In those other provinces having water transportation, the rail
rates cannot be made highcr than the comnpeting rates by water; consequently these provinces must always enjoy a fair railway rate
because of the existence of that water transportation. So far as we in the land-locked
interior of Canada are concerned, there muet
be arbitrary regulations. We cannot rely on
competition, for there is none, and we are
content to put ourselves in the hands of the
Board of Railway Commissioners. We would
hesitate before we would put ourselves in the
hands of Parliarnent in the matter of fixing
rates, and I fancy that I may say, on behalf
of my part of the country, that we accept
the concession contained in this Bill. We
regret that the Government could, not go
further and extend the samne consideration
ta those commodities when going west. We
think the Government might have been well
advised to consider that, because, after ai, if
those commodities go west they do flot go
east; you do flot have te ship them. both
ways. Therefore the railway companies would
be no worse off, one would think, in ehippîng
t'hem west than in éhipping them. east. Be
that as it may, we must regard this Bill as an
attempt to solve a 'very difficuit, and in the
West a very serious, question, and I for one
arn prepared to aceept the Bill as it is.

Hon. Mr. DÂNDURANU:
Honourable
gentlemen, would you allew me- ta cite the
opinion of one who has earned the respect
of so large a part of the population as te
be the head of one of the great parties in
Canada? Just before Parliament met, the
leader of the Conservative Party announced
a programme which has beeni publishied in
the pres. I znight read it from. the press,
or fromn a resolution which has appeared for
two or three months in the routine proceedings of the other Chamber. I believe
that hie was echoing the general opinion of a
large element in this country. Mr. MarIer,
a talented member of Parliament representing Montreal, had shortly before expressed
similar views, to the effect that we should do
something to meet tVhase conditions which
the honourable gentleman froin Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Griesbach) has mentioned as existing
in the provinces of the West, so fer away fromn
the seaboard. The last clause of the right hion.
gentleman's resolution, which was apparently
a programme that hie intended to lay before
the electors, says:
That to enable the produots of the Western and

Maritime Provinces to

reachTuOre'

Teadily the markets

so developed the special transportation burdens borne
by those provinces should be shared by the whole
Dcminion either by contribution to long hau! freight
costs or by assistance de some other form.

Hon. Mr. McCORMICK: Will the hionourable gentleman please state who was the
author of that?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen. That was the programme. 1
believe it was brought before the other Chamnber in the very samne f orm. At ahl events it
has ail the importance that we muet attach
to the pranouncement of the leader of a
Party. Now the Government cornes before
Parliament and actually does the very thing
that the leader of the Conservative Party
suggests as a solution of the western problemn. I was convinced that that proposition
would rneet with no objection.
Yet my
honourable friend from Grenville pronaunced
himself strongly-and so did the honourable
gentleman from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) this morning-against the ides of giving a certain compensation ta aur Western
Provinces for the disability under which they
labour. It seems te me that the proposition
is a fair one, and that at ail events the provinces of Ontario and Quebec will flot begrudge the western farmers that advantage,
substantial though it may be. May I add
thst by this saine Act we ar~e holding the
Canadian Pacific Railway to a part of the
obligation it assumed in 1897, when it reoeived three andi a half millions for the build-

these reasons I ask that we pass this Bill in
its present form.
Honourable
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON:
gentlemen, I want to refer to an observation
made by my honourable friend the leader of
the Government with regard to the announced policy of the right honourable gentleman who leads the Conservative Party in
Canada. I feel sure that in the document
mentioned it was intended to allude only to
the Maritime Provinces and British Columbia, because, as is well known, the Prairie
Provinces were already enjoying benefits not
The
enjoyed by other parts of Canada.
special reference is to the far distant parts
of the country, namely, British Columbia
and the Maritime Provinces.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No. He says the
Western Provinces and the Maritime Provmnces.
Honourable
lion. Mr. ROBERTSON:
gentlemen surely know that there was no
to the prairies in that, when the
refer:e
prairies aready enjoyed special rates.
lon. Mr. DANDURANID:
the whole West.

No; that covers

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: While I am on
my feet. may I refer briefly to some points in
I think
connection with this controversy?
the time must come soon, if it has not already
arrived, when we must discontinue holding
up this Crowsnest Pass Agreement of 1897 as
an inviolate obligation on the part of the
whole country to continue in perpetuity. It
has been stressed here, I am sure, five or six
times to-day, that the people of Canada gave
to the Canadian Pacifie Railway three and a
half millions of dollars in 1897, and that the
Canadian Pacifie Railway are consequently
under obligation for all time to keep that
agreement. Let me state this simple fact, that
in 1923, when the Government by Act of Parliament restored the Crowsnest Pass Agreement, the losses to the two railway companies
on the carrying of the wheat crop were just
$25,000,000. The Canadian Pacifie sustained a
loss of $13,000,000 and the Canadian National
$12,000,000. Now, if the Canadian Pacifie Railway is to pay interest at the rate of $13,000,000 a year on a gift of three and a half
millions made nearly thirty years ago, it seems
to me, the Canadian Pacifie made a bad bargain.
Will my honHon. Mr. BELCOURT:
ourable friend allow me to put him a question with regard to that very point?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Surely.

During this SesHon. Mr. BELCOURT:
sion, and not very long ago, the President
of the 'C.P.R. stated in my hearing, and, I
think, in the hearing of my honourable friend,
that whilst the carrying of grain was not
profitable they were not losing any money
by it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have not suggested that they were losing anything.

:Mr.

LAIRD:

The loss of
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
$25.000.000 was the loss in consequence of
the reduction of the rate, as compared with
what they would have received haýd the
Crowsnest Pass rate not been enforced.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

Well,-

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Pardon me. Let
me finish to make myself clear. Last year,
when in the Railway Committee we were
considering the construction of certain branch
lines in the W est, gentlemen from the province of Saskatchewan carne before that Conmittee and stated, in answer to questions, that
the railways in the Canadian West were carrying to the head of the Lakes. the same distance as the American roads were, for 8 cents
a bushel less. That was a gain to the Western farmer. We are all glad to see him have
that. Nobody is objecting to it. But I do
respectfully point out that we cannot sit
quietly by andi hear this old 1897 agreement
harped upon as something that must continue
in perpetuity, at the expense of the whole
country, if the railroads are not self-supporting. The railroads must pay their way.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will my honourable friend answer my question?
Surely I have
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
answered it.
Was not that
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT:
staltement made within the past few weeks,
that the railway company were not making
much money in carrying the grain, and if
they had the American rate they would be
making a good deal of moneyHon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes.
Mr. BELCOURT: But, whilst at the
lower rate they did not make money, they did
not lose. Was not that the statement madle?

iHon.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I camnot say, because I did not hear the statement, nor have
I seen it.

JUNE 20, 1925
HIon. Mr. BELCOURT: I heard it very
distinctily.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: But here is the
point I wa;s trying to arrive at. My honourable friend fromn Portage la Prairie (Hon.
Mr. Watson) is broad-m.inded enough and
fair enough not to take the position that the
Orowsnest Pass Agreement must be respected
for time and eternity. He says: "No. We
recognize that times have changed, and conditions have changed, and that as changes
occur there must be aiterations in existing
standards. We realize that we are ge4ting
benefits out of this particular legislation."
And be is stating the fact.
In 1897, when the Crowsnest Pass Agreement was made, there were probably les than
400 Canadian Pacifie Railway stations on the
Prairies, and no Canadian National stations.
Under the decision with reference to these
rates they are applicable and enforced only
on certain lines, less than one-fifth of the total
mileage and stations now on the western
prairies. The advantages of the Crowsnest
Pas Agreement are by this legislation automatically extended to five times the number
of people that would otherwise benefit; and
in consideration of this great gain respecting
grain and flour, their principal commodities,
they are forfeiting those lower rates which
they formerly enjoyed on coal oil, nails, fruit,
etc., which, as we ail know, do not go from
Eastern Canada in such quantities as they
did in years gone by. Supplies of oil, fruit,
etc., come in from the British Columbia
Coast.
Therefore tis is in my opinion a new agreement, and from ithis time forward we ought
to hear nothing more about the old Crowsnest Agreement of 1897. The Government are
making an adjustment now, in view of changed
conditions, as ;my honourable friend from
Portage la Prairie says. I do not agree that
they have gone far enough. I think it should
have been left entirely in the bands of the
Railway Commission to deal equitably with
aill people in connection with rates. I hold
that a re-adjustiment was an absolute necessity, and the Government have gone a substanitial way in that direction, but, they have
not gone as far as I think they ought to have
gone. I desire, however, to stress the point
that in my opinion we have reached the time
when we ought not to hark back to the old
Crawsnest Pass Agreement and say that it is
as undhangeable as the law of the Modes and
Persians.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: We paid three and a
haif million dollars for it.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: And the Canadian Pacific in 1923 lost thirteen millions, as
compared with what they would have received had it not existed. But the country at large
did not get the thirteen millions.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Waa that becaSuse of
the Crowsnest Pass deal?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes, that was
when Parliament put it in force.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: I would aike to inforrm
my honourable friend that the Crowsnest Pass
deal has not controlled the rate on wheat in
Manitoba since 1901. It is the raite fixed by
the Roblin Government of that year that has
governed ever since. The C.P.R. came down
to meet that rate, and the C.N.R. rate was
raised a iittle in order to make a compromise.
Those are the factors that have controlled all
the rates in the three Western Provinces ever
sinee.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Up to 1918.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE:

Yes.

When the
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
Crowsnest Pass rates were exceeded. I have
not attempted to summarize the losses of
the railways during all the years since 1918.
I have cited only 1923 as an exampe.
One other point in connection with this
matter is, I think, important and worthy of
consideration, although it is not before us at
this time, namely, the question, what would
be a fair and proper basis for rate computation, particularly with regard to these two
commodities. In 1923, I am sure, the whole
country was in entire sympathy with the
desire to give the best possible rate to the
grain grower of the West. His price was so
depressed as to make the industry almost
unprofitable. Everybody was glad to see the
Western farmer given the advantage of that
8 cents a bushel less than the Montana farmer
was paying for the transportation of his grain
an equal distance. But I feel sure that it is
also true to say that in 1924, when the
farmer in the West was getting $1 a bushel
more for his wheat than be did in 1923 there
was not nearly the same sympathy for him
throughout the country as in the previous
year. Therefore it is, in my opinion, wel to
consider the fluotuating rate on wheat is in
some degree corresponding with the market
price. If the price is so low that the industry
is not very profitable, the country sbould
help it; on the other hand, if the price of
wheat doubles and the production of wheat
is very profitable the country should not be
asked to transport it at less than cost, or even
at cost. As a comparison with that, suppose

630

SENATE

that the wages of factory workers were ta
increase 100 per cent and the prices of
commodities remained the same. Of course,
you appreciate what chaos would at once
occur. It seems ta me that the same principle applies to some extent in this matter
of rates on wheat in the West.
There is another thought with reference ta
rate,making. I refer to a matter that is
probably outside our jurisdiction here, but
I think it is worthy of consideration. The
railroad must handle this product either east
or west. At the present time there is a
special low rate down to the head of the
Lakes, and thence where? Thence into the
co-operative elevator owned by the Saskatchewan people in the city of Buffalo.
That is one of the reasons why our port of
Quebec caused some discussion yesterday. If
the reduction of rates were not all west of
the head of the Lakes, but helped ta carry
that grain ta Canadian ports for export, then
it would probably be more sensible ta send
the grain by the Canadian route. At present
it is shipped at an abnormally low rate by
a route that pours it out of our country, ta
the detriment of Canadian ports on both the
Atlantic and the Pacific.
I am sure that our Board of Railway Commissioners are men of sufficient ability ta
recognize all these things, and if the matter
had been left entirely in their hands, as I
think should have been donc without restriction, the whole country would have received
a fair deal. But itasmuch as the Government
have seen fit ta go only part of the wayhave extended the benefits on grain and flour
so that they exceed by far the disadvantages
of the removal of the other products from
the low rate, I cannot see that the Prairie
Provinces suffer any loss at all. It is surely
not consistent for us ta attack at this time
the failure of the Government ta fix arbitrarily a low rate of any sort, either into the
Maritimes or into British Columbia. We
must await, I think, the results of the work
of the Railway Commission, and on some
future occasion we can say what we think
about those results.
Mr. JOHN McCORMICK:
Honourable
gentlemen, I have been listening for some
statement from the supporters of this Bill
that would justify any reasonable person in
supporting the clause with regard ta wheat and
flour. I do nat think that anybody will
attempt ta say that we have had anything
like an argument ta prove that this clause
should be passed. The honourable leader
of the Government asks if that this House
takes the position that it will fix the rates.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

That is just the position that this House does
nat take. As I understand, the Senate has
no desire ta fix the rates, because we are not
competent ta do so, but we want ta leave the
Board ta which this Government is referring
the matter unfettered and untrammeled in
deciding what the rates shall be, and in adjusting them in accordance with the needs of
all the interests, all the industries and the
different localities in the country. That object is interfered with by the clause.
What is the ground on wbich it is contended that grain and flour from the prairies
should be treated differently from other commodtities? It is because in 1897 the Crowsnest
Pass Agreement was made. That arrangement
was entered into prior ta the creation of the
Railway Board, and it fixed a rate-for what
reason? Because three and a half millions of
money had been paid. Was it by the Prairie
Provinces that those three and a half millions of money were paid? It was the money
of Canada, chargeable ta all the people of
this country. The man who framed that
legislation and framed the Act constituting
the Railway Board never intended that this
should be a permanent arrangement. I have
here a statement from his secretary, a man
who was intimate with him for long years
befcre the Crowsnest Pass Agreement was
made, and during all the years when Mr.
Blair was head of the Department of Railways
and Canals. I refer ta Mr. Payne. He knew
what was in Mr. Blair's mind with regard ta
this matter. Let me read ta you what Mr.
Payne has said:
It happened that the Crownest Pass agreement of
1897 took shape under my eyes. I remember very clearly
both its purpose and its conditions. Its essential features
were dictated to me by the late Hon. A. G. Blair, and
he frankly and freely told me what was in his mind.
The Canadian Pacifie had asked for help from Gaverament in financing the construction of the proposed
Crowsnest Pass Railway. Mr. Blair saw in this appeal
an opportunity to serve the people of the West and
-let us keep back nothing-score a political point un
favor of his party.
in return for a subsidy, which did not exceed $3,500,000, the Canadian Pacifie agreed to make reductions
in its tariff of rates on certain commodities, and ta
cede t government so many acres of the coal lands it
had acquired from the overnment of British Columbia.
The thing that remains vividly in my mind is Mr.
Blair's attitude toward this whole matter. He reallv
did not at-tach much importance to it, apart from its
political value. He had at that time fuolly resolved to
se. up a Railway Commission, and, if I remember correctly, had given notice to tbat effect to Parliament.
Beyond that, Mr. Blair regarded the Crowsnest Pass
agreement as a temporary measure, to disappear when
a competent regulating tribunal had been created by
the new Railway Act he then had in course of preparation. Any other view of what was in his mind
wculd be illogical, and utterly at variance with the
fundamental principles of the Railway Act as introduced by him and adopted by Parliament in 1903.
One searches in vain through the long debate which
took place on the Railway Act in 1903 to find a syllable

JUNE 20, 1925
about the Crowenest Paue agreement, or for a word
which wotrld mndirate that it was intended to, survive
after a Railway Commission hsd been brought into,
existence. It hsd been forgotten

That being the case, and i view of thle
fact, as stated .by the honourable gentleman
who has just taken hie seat (Hou. Mr. Robertson), that the railways of the Ulnited States
charge eight cents a bushel more for carrying
grain than do our railways for the sanie
iength of haul, and that early i the
month of May application was made by
67 of those Amerioan raiiroads for an increase in rates, the Prairie Provinces have
.no just dlaim for a re-enactament of those
charges. The rooney that wa.s paid in consideration of the Crow's Nest Pass agreement
was chargeable ta the people of the whole
od Canada. Think of the C. P. R., which
made the loas just stated by my honourable
friend here, and consider the effect of the
carrying of such a large volume of traffic on
the finances of the Government systeni of
raiiways, which is not in as favourable a
position as the C. P. R., and that is now
making a loss of no less than 850,000,000 or
$60,000,000 a year. We should not expect
the C. P. R. or any other enterpirise in this
country ta do business at a ioss. It is not
fair. There is no reason *hy it should be
done. The people of the Prairie Provinces
are not entitled ta so much consideration,
and therTefore I cannot agree ta the Bill. As
that is the only objectionabie feature of the
Bill, I do not see why the honourable the
Leader of the Government could not propose*
a modification of some kind in this clause ta
provide that the railways of tihie country
shouid not be cailed upon ta carry at a loss
a freight of the magnitude of the grain and
the flour of this country.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I wouid lile ta put
the honourable gentleman in possession of
better information than hie has at the present
time. He has made the proposition, which
is a very fair one, that if the railroads are
losing inoney in the West on grainHon. Mr. TtTRRIF: They are not.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: No, they are not.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: That is what I arn
coming at. If that is the case, hie is opposed
ta the Bill; but if hie were made ta believe
that they are not iosing money there, then
it is possible hie might change uis mind.
Not long aga we had before us i a certain
Committee a witnesg who made the statement that the company in question here
made a fair share of profit on the transportation of grain last. year. I believe that when

681

my honourable friend knows that hie will not
be so strongly oppoeed to the Bill. It is
quite true that the Canadian National Railways claimed that they iost money ini the
transportation of grain, but that is another
matter for consideration.
I feel that the West is entitled to very great
consideration, and while I know, as we ail do,
that this is an agreement to which the West
was no party-it was entered inta by the
Dominion Government and the C.P.R.-and
I believe that the C.P.R. made a very improvident bargain. That being the case, some
people would want to push the matter to thé
limit, and hold them to it; but I do not thinc
that wouid be fair or reasonable at ail. To
my mmnd the Government is going far enougil
in this by compellîng thero to transport grain
for some time at a very small profit.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: It will apply ta
the other railway too.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: That is the unfortunate part of it-that the railway is losing
rooney.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: The other railway is
flot losing rooney in carrying wheat.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: The other railway is
iosing mriey on carrying wheat.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: We wili see about
that.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: That s tatement cornes
from the head of the railway.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There is something that puzzles me. WhiIe we are given
that opinion by someone connected with the
Conadian National Railways, on the other'
hand we have the statement by many higil
officiais of that eame Railway Company that
ail the western branches are profitable.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Sir HIenry Thornton
himself said sa, the other day.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I am only saying i
reply to my honourable friend that I have
had froro one of the highest officiais of the
C.P.R. the statement that they are making a
profit on grain, and I have heard from one
of the highest officiaIs of the Canadian
National Rallways that they are losing money
on grain. Whether or not the word of those
gentlemen is worth more than that of the
honourable the Leader of the Progressive
Party in this House, I do not know.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I arn puzzled by
those two contradictory statements.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I think, in view of
what I have said, that the Bill resolves itseif

632

SENATE

into a fair proposition, and that my honourable friend from Cape Breton (Hon. Mr. McCormiek), should revise his ideas, and vote
ccntrary to his original intention.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: If we compare the
yearly earnings of the Canadian National Railways, we find that they were considerably less
in 1924 than in 1923, the main reason for that
being that we had an excellent crop in the
western Provinces in 1923, which helped very
materially in bringing up the earnings in that
year. To say that the railways are losing
money by drawing grain I think is not correct.
You will find that when wé have a large crop
in the West the railways are able to make a
better showing.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I have heard it stated
here this afrernoon by several honourable genilemen that the West had such low rates on
wheat ander the Crowsnest Pass agreement
that the railways were losing money. I want
to say, honourable gentlemen, that that is
not the case, as has been proven by the C.P.R.
itself.
Hon. Mr. GORDON:

That is what I say.

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Up to 1921 the
Canadian Pacifie Railway Company presented
statenients to the Board of Railway Commissioners here in Ottawa, showing the net
profit earned by that railway from Vancouver
to Fort William, and the net profits earned
from Fort William or Port Arthur east.
What do those statements show? They show
that practically all their profits are made in
the months during which the wheat is carried
in the West. and that during the months prior
to the month of August there is practically a
division of profits between the East and the
West, and that during September the western
earnings increases over those of the East;
and that the increase continues during October, November, and December. I should have
lad the evidence here.
Hon. Mr. CORDON:
total result anyway.

We only want the

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: During some montis
the net profits on the western lines of the
C.P.R. were double those on the eastern lines;
during other months they were five times as
much, and during November, 1921-I think
it was-the last time the C.P.R. ever made
those classifications-tlie net profits in the
West were ten times as much as the net
profits
east
of
Fort
William.
If
I
remember rightly the profits during that
month in the West were over $5,000,000, and
east of Fort William some $500,000. In the
face of that evidence of the officers of the
Hon. Mr. GORDON'.

C.P.R., sworn to and submitted under the
law to the Board of Railway Commissioners,
what is the use of honourable gentlemen from
the East or from any part of the Dominion
saying that the C.P.R. and the Canadian
National Railways are carrying grain at a
loss?
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR Honourable gentlemen,
I agree with the principle of this Bill, but I
think the House will admit that it is not
divinely inspired or incapable of profitable
amendment. We in British Columbia are very
appreliensive of the effect of this proposition,
and our appreliension
is increased
by
the announced policy of the Government
in connection with the routing of grain
through British Columbia. There was a
discussion in another place a couple of
weeks ago in which it was brought out
that it was the definite intention of the
Government to promote the carriage of grain
to Prince Rupert, and the statement was
made that there was a terminal rate made
for Prince Rupert, equal to the rate to Vancouver or to the Fraser river ports. The haul
from Edmonton to Prince Rupert is 190 miles
longer than the haul to Vancouver. The immensity of the difference in cost brouglit about
by this distance may be realized from the
statement made during the same debate-and
I am quite familiar with it-that the extra
cost of hauling grain from ports on the
Fraser river to Vancouver is $13 a car or 1
cent per bushel. There is a terminal rate now
with hose two ports, the Fraser River port
and Vancouver, under which the grain trade
of the prairies last year paid no less than
$500.000 on 50,000,000 bushels, the extra cost
of hauling to Vancouver. They had not the
advantage they would have had if they had
left the grain off at New Westminster, where
many people think it belongs, because there
was a common terminal rate. Immense additions to the cost of hauling grain to the seaport would be involved in fixing a rate cornmon to Prince Rupert, Vancouver and Fraser
River.
If the Government were satisfied that the
rate fixed by the Crowsnest agreement is a
fair and profita!ble rate to the railway, it
seems to me they would have no hesitation in
extending the application of that west as
well as east. The very fact that they hesitate
to extend it west seems to indicate that they
realize that a higher rate will have to bc
establislhed, in order to be fair to the railways for the western haul.
The people of British Columbia have been
making a very vigorous figlit of dlate yearsnever more vigorous than at present. At this

JUNE 20, 1925
moment tihe Prime IMinister of British Coluinbia is in Ottawa on the very suibjeat cd thlis
Bill. R arn not in ta position to state his
arguments, 'but in a general wa.y 1 know from
his public utterances that he às very lnudh
concerned as to the effeot of this Bill on the
trade of British Ooluiûi.
In dea'ling with the Çrowsnest agreement,
as 1 see it, the Government snakes trouble
for the province of British Columnbia by thiis
proviso:
Prov'ided that, notwithstanding anythimg in this aubsection contained, rates on grain andl flour shall, on and
from tie date of the passing of this Act, be governed
by the provisions of the agreement made pursuant to
chapter 5 of the statutes of Canada, 1897.

So far so good, but this extension is
voluntarily introduced by the Government:
-but sucb rates shail appiy to ail such trafie moving
f rom ail po:nts on ail lines of railway west of Fort Williani to Fort William or Port Arthur over ail Iines
now or hereafter constructed by any company subject
to the jurisdiction of Parliamenf.

Now, if the Government is satisfied that
tJhis is a fair rate, I sec no Teason *hy that
provision Éhould not be extended to cover
BritiDh Columbia, and 1 subinit for the consideration of the representatives oif thle ýGovernment in tbis House this addition to the
section:
--and also to ail sucb trafflo moving from ail points
on ail lines of railway west of Fort William to Pacifie
cost ports over ail lines now or hereafter constructed
!by any coinpany subjeet to the juriediction of Pariament.

Then rthe position is this. 1f t'he Government feels that this is a fair rate tihat tlhey
are establishing by section 3 of this Bih11, it
wi'il have no objection to extending tihat fair
the Government
rate to British Columbia. YU
Îhesitates ito make the extension to British
Colmbia, thon it must be dlear that, in the
opinion oïf the Governient the traffic'to Br-itish Columbia from the prairies wiil have to
pay a sùlbstanitiaMl-y larger rate than is authorized by this Bill to fbe paid on grain
transported eastward for shipment which in
very large part is made through American
ports. When the position is tihua stated 1
think there can ho no real defence of a Bill
whidh places a bonus on shipment of grain
eastward Vhrouglh American ports, %o the
neglect of so, splendid a port as tihot of Vancouver on the Pacific eoast.
To have thie issue -dearly defined, witihout
ground for misrepresentaition, I move th15
amendment, seconded by Hon. Mi'. Planta.
I may say that in mov-ilg it I have nsD desire
to olbstruct the Bill, and if the Governinent
wilî frankly say that this prinoiple cannot be
accepted i waulld have no option but to
withdraw the amendiment, 'because 1 would

633

rather 'have the Bill passed than have it emba-rrassed.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Before my hionourable friend replies to the honourable member for New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Taylor),
I should like to give some information which,
1 have just obtained for my honourable friend
for Assiniboia (Hon. Mr. Turriff), with reference to the profitable end unprofitable portions of the Canadian National Railways, as
shown ini a statement issued from the pres1dent of that company. Sir Henry Thornton,
in the month cif April, issued an official
statement -as to the earninès and expenses
of the National Railway for the year 1924.
To quote the figures that relate to this discussion, I may say hie shows that the operating revenues for all Ufnes west of Port Arthur
on the whole Canadian National System,
were $65,938,000, while the operating expenses
were $67,062,000, or a deficit of 81,124,000.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: That tak-es in British
Columbia, too.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It includes al
the lines west of Fort William; that is for
the year's operation.
Hoa. Mr. TURRIFF: And ail prodiucts?
Surely.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: It does not affect
my statement at aîl.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: On the central
region, which. includes aIl lines from Port
Arthur as f ar east as Mont Joli, Quebec, the
returns are these: operating revenues, $114,564,000; operating expenses, $98,131,000; a
net surplus of $16,433,000. On the Atlantic
region, which extends from Mont Joli, Quebec, to the Atlantic seaboard, hie shows the
following result: Operating revenues, $20,721,000; operating expenses, $24,26,G00; a net
deficit .of 83,545,000.
While my honourable friend's statement
may be reasonably correct so. far as wheat and
four are concerned, the raiiroad must be
maintained and operated the year around,
and it is surely not a perfect picture to paint
the profits that may accrue over a period of
three months in the f alI when the grain is
moving, and expeet somebody else to pay
the deficits f or the rest of the year. The
traffic in that district west of the Great Lakes'
surely ought to be expected to, maintain the
railroads in that sanie territory, and I arn
giving the House the net results as reported
by the president of the Canadian National
Railways hicnself showing whether the western
or eastern lines are tihle most profitable. I have
neyer seen any statement issued by the Cana-

634

SENATE

dian Pacifie Railway showing their expenses
and revenues by districts, and therefore I
am unable to give the same information for

the C.P.R.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I understood my
honourable friend to say that the loss in
carrying wheat and grain from the west he
estimated at $25,000,000.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My honourable
friend misunderstood me. What I intended
to convey was that in 1923 the two railroads
received $25,000,000 less in revenue for carrying grain than they would have received had
the Crowsnest Pass rates not been put in
operation by Parliament in July, 1923; and
therefore I held that the C.P.R. had suffered
a loss of $13,000,000 of the $23,000,000, which
was paying very dearly for the subsidy or
gift of $3,500,000 that it got 30 years ago.
In view of the fact that my honourable
friend from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Taylor) has introduced a rather important
amendment, and a number of gentlemen left
here to-day before noon anticipating that we
might not sit this afternoon, I would respectfully suggest to my honourable friend that he
agree that the Committee rise and report
progress, and consider this matter further on
Monday.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
There is no
necessity to do that, because the honourable
member from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Taylor) has said that he would only press
his motion if it was agreeable to the Government. I suppose he wanted to have a statement from the Government on his proposition. I am unable to accept that amendment.
,The honourable gentleman wants to reverse
the proposition by applying it both ways.
The Bill contains an advantage which is based
on the principle found in the Crowsnest Pass
agreement, of fixing the maximum rate on
grain and flour moving towards Fort William. The amendment would require that
the saine rates should avail for grain and flour
moving towards British Columbia.
This is a proposition that I quite understand, coming from my honourable friend. It
is a desire which must be shared by all the
people of British Columbia; but I draw his
attention to the fact that if such a proposition
could be enter ained at all, then the proposition from my honourable friend from Manitoba (Hon. Mr. MeMeans) could also be
taken into consideration in order that Manitoba should also obtain certain privileges.
The proposition from the Maritime Provinces
also should be considered; so that practically
we should have to settle the whole railway
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

freight rates in the Senate, except as to Ontario and Quebee.
Now, I suggest that we leave these matters
where they belong. Of course I understand
that the argument is based on the fact that
we are giving a privilege to the three western
provinces on flour and grain moving towards
the east, but the experiment has been made
there for years, and we know what results
it gives to the producers as well as to the railway companies.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR:
But the experiment has been made westward, too.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But there is the
quesion of equalizing rates throughout
Canada, and surely we cannot load this mandate down with a number of conditions. It
seems to me that the condition that we have
applied is an exception that should stand
by itself, and we should not increase the
conditions.
The fixing of railway rates is a very difficult
and technical matter, and I believe that British
Columba will have to wait in patience until
it sees the work of the Railway Commission.
Possibly that work will satisfy nobody, because everybody will have to give a little
towards the maintenance of those roads. They
cannot be maintained by the people in China;
they must be maintained by the Canadian
people; and the Railway Commission will
have an eye to the generaIl interests of the
country. I have had quite a number of years'
practice at the Bar, and I find that oftentimes the best of compromises leave both
parties very much dissatisfied with their
representatives in the settlement of their difficulty because each has been obliged to yield
something. All that I know is that the Railway Conmission will try.to do the fair thing
by all the provinces, and by the countrv at
large. I cannot accept that amendment.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Does the honourable
gentleman think that British Columbia should
be asked to accept in perpetuity a higher rate
for westbound grain to British Columbia
ports than is established by this Bill for
grain to eastern ports?-because that is what
it amounts to. We are asked as representatives of British Columbia to assent to a Bill
establishing in perpetuity a discrimination
against our province.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: There is no perpetuity about this: you can change it next
year.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR:
until it is changed.

It is in perpetuity

1JTJNE 20, 1925
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend knows that I cannot answer bie question until I have the result of the work of
the Railway Commission. I do not know what
they will do. I do not knrsw what they
should do, because I have no expert knowledge.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: 'Why flot leave the
w.ho]e subject open to the Rail'way Commission? We would be satisfied with tbat.
Hon. Mr. DANI)URAND: Then my honourable friend is adverse in principle tc the
rate which is being given to the tbree western
provinces?
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: No, that is not a
fair way to put it, because the other rate
would be given to the three western provinces
just the saine. The question is that of a rat
for the provinces, whether east or weet.Bu
if a rate fixed hy this B'ill is an unfair rate,
the Railway Commission will have to prescribe
a proportionately higher rate for the westbound trafflo in order to enable the railroads
to corne clear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Not neceasarily,
because the Railway Commission rnay corne
to the conclusion that 'those two railways are
making money on that present rate, and it
seeme to me that British Columbia bas al
te gain by the maximum rate 'that is fixed
there. Before the Raiiway Commission their
representatives will be able te point out
their situation, and the advantages, there
would be ta the province of Alberta, as weli,
and the fairness there would be, in a rate being
fixed in such a way as would not discriminate
against the port of Vancouver. There is a
short haul fromn Alberta to Va.ncouver, and
I wouid utilize to a ¶nighty degree the fact
of that precedent being there, of the advantage being given to the grain bound for the
east lnoving under those rates.
Migbt I just ssk
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR:

Minister of British Columbia witb logie of

I would have

chance I had was ta, sbake bande with him ini

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Mr. Chairman, I said
that if the bonourable leader of the Government could not accept it, I would withdraw
it. I ask leave to witbdraw.
The amendment of Hon. MT. Taylor was
witbdrawn.
Section 3 was agreed to.

M3

On section 4-toile in tarifes filed prior ta
Act, to be deemed lawful:
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Honourable gentlemen, I have a amail amendment ta section 4.
It does not disturb the principle of the Bill.
The Government of the Province of Manitoba
made an agreement with the Canadian
Northern Railway, which was embodied in an
Act of the Manitoba Legisiature and ratified
by an Act of the Parliament of the Dominion
of Canada. A dispute arose as to whether
or not the provisions of that agreement were
over-ridden by the Railway Act, and an appeal
was taken froin one court to another, and
went finally to the Supreme Court. The
Supreme Court decided against the province.
Now the province has appealed to the Privy
Council, and the case will very likely be tested
next October.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What is the
effect of the Supreme Court's decision?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: It was, as I understand, that the agreement was overridden
by the Railway Act. I arn not very positive
about it. In any event, the province of
Manitoba lost its case.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That doce not
say very much.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: The purpose of my
amendment is that this clause 4 should not
affect the litigation pending before the Privy
Council. I do not see that the honourable
leader of the Government can have any objection to a *perfectiy juet proposition of this
kind.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: How could -t
affect the litigation?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: It would affect it,
because clause 4 would simply put us out of
court. We might as~ well take the case away
from the Privy Council now. I may say
further that I arn introducing this amendment
at the request of the Attorney Cencrai of the
Province of Manitoba:
Provided that nothing herein or i this Act contained
shali in any way affect the pending litigation between
tha Governenent of Manitoba and the Canadian Northern Railway Company arising out of an agreement
between the eaid province and the said coinpany dated
the Ilth of 8'ebruary, 1901, confirmed by Chapter 39
of the Statutes of Manitoba, 1901, and by Chapter 58
of the Statutes of Canada, 1901, or any right or obligation of the parties thoreto, or ekher of them, expreased in the said agrement and the said Statutes.

Han. Mr. DANDURAND: Would you paso
le it only that
me the amendment, please?
you may secure costa?
1 do not know.
Hon. 'Mr. MôMEANS:
The lawyers will get the coste in soine way or
another, 1 suppose.

SENATE

636

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I am sorry to
say-because it is always more pleasant to say
yes than to say no-that I cannot accept that
amendment.
I cannot accept it because the
purpose of this legislation is to wipe out
such agreements and to free the country and
the Board of Railway Commissioners from all
these entanglements, whether in the East,
the West, or the Centre.
My honourable
friend blandly asks that the rates fixed under
that agreement may still prevail.
The province of Manitoba moved very slowly in this
matter. It decided at a certain time to make
an appeal to the Board of Railway Commissioner.
Before whom was the application
heard?
Before Sir Henry Drayton.
After
giving full consideration to the validity of the
Manitoba Act, Sir Henry Drayton declared
that, it could not prevail, that the authority
given to the Commission superseded that
Act.
It took a number of years for the
province of Manitoba to make another move.
It entered an appeal vhich went before the
Supreme Court.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I would remind the
honourable gentleman that it was a good
Liberal Government in Manitoba that was
doing all these things.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
That does not
matter to me.
Just now we are trying to
solve a national problem.
The Supreme
Court, I believe, unanimously confirmed the
decision of the Railway Commission.
Now, what are we doing by this Bill? We
are wiping out the right of the Canadian
Pacific Railway to appeal from the Supreme
Court's last decision.
Hon. Mr. GORDON:
C.N.R.

I thought it was the

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I am speaking
of the Canadian Pacifie Railway.
We are
putting them both under the same rule.
We
are wiping out the right of the Canadian
Pacific Railway to appeal from the decision
rendered by the Supreme Court lately, declaring that the Crowsnest Pass Agreement
is not superseded by the Act constituting the
Board of Railway Commissioners.
Hon. Mr. McCORMICK: If this Bill goes
through, will it not supersede all other Acts,
neluding the Crowsnest Pass Act?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Yes, this Act
will supersede them.
At all events, by this
legisiation the Parliament of Canada expresses its will to clear the way for free action
by the Railway Commission.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
them freedom.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS.

And then refuses

Hon. Mr. DAINDURAND: This is the onily
sensible procedure, and it will bring us out
of the priesent state of confusion in the matter of rates. The Canadian Northern was refused aid by .the Dominion Government when
it was projedting the construotion of ite road
through the Rockies from Edmonton to Vancouver. It went to the Provincial Government of British Coluimbia and from that Governmenit obtained Ithe necessary aid to build
it;s line. And to what did it bind itself? It
agreed to allow the absolute control of its
rates by the Provincia(l Government. The line
was being constructied under provincial charter
and subsidized by the Provincial Government.
The Provincial 'Government insertedi in its
subsidy nontrat the obligation on the part
of the railway to remain under provincial law.
The Borden Goverament came into power
and notwithstanding that written, binding contract. declared ,that under the clause respecting the "general advanitage of Canada," that
railway should be under Federal jurisdiction,
and Parliament so decided. It thereby brought
the rates under the jurisdiction of the Board
of Railway Commissioners, in spite of that
contract under which the road was built.
Thus the privilege which belonged to the
province of British Columbia was wiped out.
The same principle was aipplied in the
Manitoba case, when the Railway Board declared, and the Supreme Court of Canada reaffirmed, that the Railway Act of 1903 superseded the law of the province of Manitoba.
That province should net intervene at this
jun|cture to prevenit an equalization of rates
in Canada. As my honourable friend from
Portage la Prairie (Hon. Mr. Watson) has
well said, Manitoba is getting, undetr this
Bill, t:he advantage of the maximum rate on
flour and grain on three times the railway
mileage covered by the agreement of 1897. I
believe that the advantage obtained by Manitoba is of considerable value to that province,
and it will have to sacrifice the slender hope
contained in its right of apipeal to the Privy
Council. It lost its case before the Railway
Board, wi'th Sir Henry Drayton as Chairman.
It lost its appeal to the Supreme Court. It
is on an equal footing with the Canadian
Pacifie R-ailway, which at present has a right
of appeal from ,the Supreme Court decision
which maintainedi the Crowsnest Pass agreement. Under the nircumstances I think that
the same rule should be applied to both the
province of Manitoba and the Canadian
Pacifie railway, and I hope that my honourtable friend (Hon. Mr. MnMeans), like the
honourable gentleman from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Taylor), will withdraw his amendment.

JUNE 20, 1925
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: I wouild like to ask
my honourahle friend a question. Had -the
lailway Commission conîtrol of the rates on
whe&t in 'Manitoba during the yeara from 1901
tG 1918?
Hon. -Mr. DANDURAND: I arn sorry Vo
say ýthat Il have not a copy of the judgnent
given by the Raiilway Board when. it reifused
the appication of the Province, of Manitoba.
That judgment would be an, answer teo zy
honouïrable friend. I do not know exactlýr at
what date ît was rendered. My honourable
friend must iremember that Sir Henry Drayton was Ohairman, of that Board for a numiaer
of years prior to 1920-I do not know how
xnany years. But I shouki think that the Railway Commission <elaimed full control, subject
to the Crowsnest Pass agreement.
Hon. Mr. SHXRPE: No.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As to that I
am not in a position te Say.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Subjeet to. the ManiVoba agreement.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My honourable
friend seems Vo place very much stress upon
the decision of Sir Henry Drayton as Chairman of tlie Board of Railway Commîssioners
ini this particular case. May I inquire wliy
it is, that lie and lis Government upset the
decision of the Board of Railway Commissioners in the recent Crowenest case, subsequently sent the matter to the Supreme
Court of Canada, and now steps in to prohibit the province of Manitoba from laying
its case., at its own expense, before the Privy
Coun-cil?
The answer is
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
very siniýple: my hon ourable friend is in
errer as to the fact. The Goverament did
flot ppset the decision of the Raillway Board
with regard to the Crowenest Pass Agreement
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The Govemnment
sent it to the Supreme Court.
No, the GovHon. MT. DANT>URAND:
ernment did not send it Vo the Supreme
Court. There was a direct appeal taken by
the three Prairie Provinces Vo. the Siipreme
Court, and at the sme time an a~ppeal was
made Vo the Privy Council. The provisional
decision of the Privy Council was aimply to
this effect, that it would suspend the judgment
of the Board of Railway Commissioners until
the appeal by those provinces fromn the Board's
decision had been settled in the Suprerne
Court, which was to meet within Vhirty day.
That is qu4te often done in the courts. Generally speaking, a judgment rendered in court

637

lias no executive effeet if there is an appeal
lodged. The only thing the Privy Councîl
did was to allow the merits of the case to. be
decided by the Supreme Court, on 'the question of the legal interpretatiom of the contract. The Piivy Council, after having taken
cognizane of that decision, pasged judgment
on the 5th of June instant on the appeal
which had been made direct to it. I cited the
conclusions at Vhs morning's sitting.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: But my honourable friend and his Governmenit surely concurred in the Supreme Court dealing with
that subjeet a.nd determining the point of
law; yet, as I understand it, by legisiation
the Goveroment now proposes to step in and
interfere witli the province of Manitoba in
its effort to obtain what it regards as justice
before the Privy Council.
But my honHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ourable f riend must flot forget that it doa
the same thing with regard to the Crowsnest
Pass agreement, which was declared valid by
the Supreme Court. It now 13roceeds, in the
face of that judgment, to declare that the
A.greement shall noV be effective except on
those two items; whereas in the case of Manitoba it simiply con.firms the Supreme Court's
judgment, that the Manitoba agreement shall
noV apply. Even had the Supreme Court
declared it Vo be va.lid and binding, the
Government would have been under the obligation of wiping iV out, as it wipes out the
contract entered into in, 18917, which was
declared valid by the Supreme Court. The
Canýadian Pacifie Railway is in a far better
position Vo complain, on the ground of equity,
than is the province of Manitoba. The Canadian Pacifie is confronted with a judgment
whicli imposes that contract upon it, and it
wants to have that contract declared no longer
bîndJing. The province of Manitoba is trying
tio enforce an agreement that bas been declareci invalîd.
So, from whatever angle you view it, the
question now before Parliament ip: shall the
Board of Railway Commissioners clear up the
cliaotic situation resul'ting from the judgment
of the Supreme Court, which lîmits the Crowsnest Pass Act and agreement to the Canadian
Pacifie Railway as it existed in 1897? 1 think
my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Robertson)
has stated in clear ternis that the Railway
Commission is the tribunal epeeially qualified
to fix rates. Surely he would flot hamper
that work hy having that Manitoba contract
declared valid, as my honoura-ble friend from,
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. McMeans) desires to, do
by his amendment. I am quite sure that if

638

SENATE

that amendment were passed the Government
woul'd have to withdraw this Bill, because its
purpose would then be defeated. The object
is to free the Railway Board from all the
entanglements of special acts such as the
Crowsnest Pass agreement and the Manitoba
contract. My honourable friend from Winnipeg
would have these left in abeyance until the
Privy Council has rendered a decision. But,
even when the Privy Couneil has decided,
Parliament is supreme. The railways are
under the control of the Parliament of Canada.
Canada is free to deal with this matter and
clothe the Railway Commission with all the
necessary powers. I frankly say that if this
amendment passes the Bill will be in jeopardy.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I would like to
point out, in order to clear the atmosphere,
that the province of Manitoba, under its
agreement, is in a position entirely different
from that of British Columbia. The Crowsnest Pass agreement was a matter over which
the Parliament of Canada had jurisdiction,
because they were a party to it. The British
Columbia agreement was a provincial arrangement and was not recognized by the Dominion,
But the Manitoba agreement, which was made
for a consideration, was ratified by an Act
of the Provincial Legislature, and in order to
make it absolutely sure that Manitoba had
full rights in the matter, an Act was passed
by the Dominion Parliament, ratifying the
agreement and making it binding upon the
Dominion of Canada. Surely that is in a
different position from any other. I do not
think there is anything in the argument to
foreshadow what may be the judgment of
the Privy Council. We know of many cases
in this country in which the Supreme Court's
unanimous decision lias been reversed. There
are several cases of that kind. I regret that
I cannot accede ta the honourable gentleman's request and withdraw the amendmentin the first place, because I feel very strongly
about it and, in the second place, because it
was introduced, as I said in the beginning, at
the request of the Attorney General of the
Province of Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. TODD: I would like to urge
the honourable Senator to withdraw his
amendment. I understand from the Leader
of the Government that if the amendment is
not withdrawn he will withdraw the Bill. I
am not very much in love with this Bill; I
think the entire Crowsnest agreement should
have been cut out, and full power given to
the Railway Commission; but what is going
to be the effect if the Bill is withdrawn? The
present condition will be bettered by the Bill,
and I think it would be a great mistake to
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

do anything that would prevent the bringing
about of that change.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
We have got
into a situation from which a serious result
will ensue if the statement of my honourable
friend is made in sincerity. I have no desire
to see the beneficial results that I think will
flow from this legislation defeated, but I do
not think my honourable friend stated the
case quite clearly when he compared the
Manitoba situation with the Crowsnest agreement. In one case you are presuming to take
away everything that Manitoba has an opportunity of gaining, and, on the other hand, in
cancelling the Crowsnest agreement and
putting the new conditions into. effect, you
are vastly improving the situation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But the conditions are the same, practically, as would
be enjoyed by the Province of Manitoba.
The Province of Manitoba is enjoying advantages under this Act.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I would make
this suggestion again to my honourable friend.
We do not wish, and ought not, to act
hastily on any matter in this House. It is
now nearly six o'clock, and as a number of
the members of this House, who did not
anticipate that this controversy would arise
this afternoon. are not present, I would urge
ny honourable friend to agree that the Committee rise, report progress, and ask leave
to sit again on Monday.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I dislike suggesting that time should not be given to the
Senate to ponder over the situation, and if
there is any decided opinion that this matter
should be thrown over to Monday next, I
wiil agree to that, although there is'a pretty
heavy Order Paper for Monday and Tuesday,
which may be the last days of the Session.
If my honourable friend, after consultation
with his friends, thinks that an adjournment
wouid be desirableSome Hon. SENATORS: Settle it now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There seems to
be *a desire, even on the other side of the
House, that we should settle this matter
now.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
I am not insisting, although it would be with some hasitation that I would agree to proceeding in
the absence of important members on this
side of the House.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The amendment
could be made on the third reading.

RAILWAY FREIGHT RATES BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading of Bill 181, an Act to amend the
Railway Act.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Honourable gentlemen, wlhen this Bill was in Committee I
moved an a.mendment, which was afterwards
withdrawn on the understanding that 1 might
move it on the third reading. There was not
a large attendance in Committee, and it was
therefore thought advisable to leave over the
proposed amendinent until a larger number
of honourable Senators were present.
The amendment that I propose means
simply this. The Manitoba Government have
an appeal pending before the Privy Couneil
with regard to a contract made between that
Governinent and the Canadian Northern
Railway in 1901. That eontract waa ratified
by an Act of the Provincial Legisiature, and
afterwards by an Act of the Dominion Parliament. So I dlaim tihat it stands in a position
somewhat different froin that of any other
agreement. As to the Crowsnest Pasa agreement between the Dominion Government and
the C. P. R., there is clearly a right to abrogate it. The Manitoba case waz taken by
the Provincial Government before the courts.

SENATE
but so far the courts have decided against
Manitoba. An appeal has been made to the
Privy Council and will be heard in October.
All I ask in this amendment is that any right
that the Manitoba Government have may be
reserved until after the decision is given.
The ameadment reads as follows:
That this Bill be net now read a third time, but be
referred back te Committee of the Whole House, with
instructions te amend the said Act by adding section
4 thereof the following:
"Provided that nothing herein or in this Act contained shall in any way affect the pending litigation
between the Government of Manitoba and the Canadian
Northern Railway Company arising out of an agreement
between the said province and the company dated
the 1lth of February, 1901, confirmed by Chapter 39
of the Statutes of Manitoba, 1901, and by Chapter 53
of the Statutes of Canada, 1901, or any right or obligation of the parties thereto, or either of them, expressed in the said agreement and the said Statutes."

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, I had occasion on Saturday to
state that I could not accept that amendment;
that it would tend to load the Bill in such a
way as to prevent free action by the Board of
Railway Conmissioners. I stated that the
wholle p-olicy contained in this measure was
the freeinir of the Railxway Board from all
klnds of entanglienents, special or otherwise.
I stated .that British Columbia had granted
subsidies to the Canadian Nonthern Pacifie
Railw.ay Company on condition that the Province should control rates, but that despite this
express condition, the Parliament of Canada
had passed an Act providing that .that raïiway
should be incorporated in our systerm, by being
deci.ared to be a work for the general aidvantage of Canada, 'and it thus ca.me under the
jurisdic;tion of the Board of Raidway Commissioners. The Manitoba. Legislature had a
similar enactment, which it diaimed was not
supenseded by the Aot of 1903, granting
powers to the Raiiway Board. The matter
went before tie Railway Crmmission, and
Manitoba pleaded its 'case. I have already
pointed out that at that time Sir Henry Drayton was Chairman of the Commission. The
Board dismissedi the claim. It
remained
dormant for years after this decision, 'but latterly the Manitoba government went before
the Suipreme Court to test that judgment. The
Supreme Court unanimously deolared against
the Manitoba Government's daim.
This Bill does not refer specially to the Act
of Mani-toba. It is a generai statute intended
to cover ald matters that are under Federal
juriusdiction. -Subseation 5 of seation 325, whidh
is repealed, reads as foldows:
"(5) Notwithstanding the provisions of section three
the powers given te the Board under this Act te fix,
determine and enforce just and reasonable rates, and
te change and alter rates as changing conditions or

Hon. Mr. McMEANS.

provisions of any Act of the Parliament of Canada,
whether general in application or special and relating

localities, or Of undue or unreasonable preference, on
the ground that such discrimination or preference is
justified or required by any agreement made or entered
inte by the company: Provided that this subsection
shall remaain in force only during the period of ýhree
years from and after the date of the passing of this
Act."

In piace of tha.t subsection, the Bill enacts:
(5) Notwithstanding the provisions of section three
the powers given te the Board under this Act te fix,
determine and enforce just and reasonable rates, and
te change and alter rates as changing conditions or
cost of transportation may from time te time require,

the Board shall not excuse any charge of unjust

preference is justified or required by any agreement
made or entered into by the company: Provided that,
notwitlistanding anything in this subsection contained,
rates on grain and flour shall, on and from the date
of the passing of this Act, be governed by the provisions of the agreement made pursuant te chapter five
of the statutes of Canada, 1897, but such rates shall
apply to all suic traffic moving fromî all points on all
Ines of railway west of Fort William te Foit William
or Port Arthur over all lines now or hereafter constructed
by any coipany subject te the jurisdiction of Parliament.
(6) The Board shall net excuse any charge of unjust
discrimination, whether practised against shippers, consignees, or localities or of undue or unreasonable preftrence, respecting rates on grain and flour, governed
by the provisions of chapter five of the statutes of
Canada, 1897, and by the agreement made or entered
into pursuant thereto, within the territory in the immediately preceding subsection referred te, on the
is
ground that such discrimination or preference
justified or required by the said Act or by the agreemnt made or entered into pursuant thereto.
4. To retmtove doubts the tolls specified in tariffs filed
at any timîe prior te the passing of this Act, with the
Board in accordance with the provisions of The Railway Act, 1919, are and shall be deemed lawful tolls
until varied by tariffs filed with the Board pursuant
te this Act, notwithstanding the provisions of any Act
or any agreenent, and notwithstanding any judgmîents
or orders made, at any time prier te the passing of
this Act, with regard thereto.

This is on the same lines as the Act of 1919.
It does not exclude, by any speciail and direct
declaration, the rights of any province. It
states what shal be the law of Canada, within
the Federal jurisdiction. I cannot agree that
there should be added to this Bill, on behaif
of any province, a clause which would make
the statute subject to any condition prevailing
under any provincial Act. If Manitoba thinks
it still has rights, it may continue to press
thern before the courts. I ask that the Senate
accept this Bill without loading it with ail
sorts of entanglements, which would be det-

SUNNYBRAE-GUYSBOROUGH
LINE BILL

BRANCH

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 210, an Act respecting the
Construction of a Canadian National Railway Line between Sunnybrae and Guysborough, in the Province of Nova Scotia.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this is one
of the Bil'ls we studied last year in the Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and
Harbours. With three or four other Bills, it
was rejected by the Senate. Since then we
have had from the House of Commons already this Session, two Bills which were again
submitted to our deliberations and adopted.
This Bill has for its object the building of
67 miles of railway running from Sunnybrae
to Guysborough. There was last session quite
a difference of opinion in regard to the advisability of building this road. The Committee hesitated considerably before it rejected the Bill, though at one time I thought
it would give its assent to it. As far back
as 1911 it had been decided to build this railway, and, if I mistake not, a sum of money
for that purpose was included in the Supply
Bill and voted by Parliament. There was a
change of Government in 1911, and for some
reason or other the construction was not proceeded with. The question now is as to the
wisdom of doing what was not done in 1911,
and which was postponed last year. I do
not know what the members of the Senate
felt, as to the length of time that should
elapse before the Bill should be again submitted for the consideration of this Chamber;
but it is now with us, and will be sent to the
Committee to be examined seriously, like al
the other Branch Line measures.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May I ask
my honourable friend if it is his intention to
have this Bill referred to the Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours,
if it be read a second time?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Of course, it is
a public Bill, and Mhould rightly belong to
the Committee of the Whole; but if there is
any suggestion that it should be examined
before the Standing Committee on Railways,
Telegraphs and Harbours, as was done last
year, I have no special objection.
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. C. E. TANNER: I have a few observations to make in regard to this proposai
I am quite well aware that there is to some
exitent an atmosphere of what might be called
scepticism in regard to this project, a scepticism which I think is not justifiable when the
merits of the measure itself are considered,
but which is the product of the sponsors in
Nova Scotia of this measure. In my judgment they are wholly responsible for any adverse sentiment which prevails in regard to
the usefulness or public advantage of this
proposed railway. I shall give some evidence
on this aspect of the matter, and the manner
in which the measure is being treated by
those sponsom in-another House.
On the 8th of this month the Minister of
National Defence found it advisable to
proceed to Nova Scotia. While there lie
attended a meeting called for the purpose of
nominating candidates for !the provincial
election which is now being held. With
that I have no fault to find: lie had a
perfect right to go to the meeting and
make an address there; but when that
honourable gentleman, for his own purposes, chose to issue a challenge to the members of this fHouse, I think lie did so more for
the purpose of causing the defeat of the
measure in this House than to promote it. At
that meeting in Pictou the Minister of
National Defence said that last year this
proposition had been defeated by the Tory
Senators. That statement was absolutely
untrue. The Bill was defeated by the unanThe
imous vote of the whole Senate.
evidence can be found in the Senate Debates
of July 3, 1924. The Bill was reported against
by the standing committee on Railways, and
its report was unanimously adopted by this
House without one word of debate. Therefore I say that that honourable gentleman
made a statement which he must have known
to be wholly untrue, because lie had access
to these records, and must have known what
actualhy took place in this House.
In addition to that, the honourab(le gentleman proceeded to challenge this House by
saying that lie was coming back to Ottawa,
and that this Bill would, be introduced then,
and' he would see what the gentlemen to whom
he referred would do with it. I want to say
that that is not the kind of atmosphere to
create in this House or in any representative
House where there is a sincere desire to have
a Bill or a proposition go through; but it
is the kind of action which I would expect
from any person who had in his mind a desire
to bring about the defeat of the measure.

JUNE 22, 19254
Further, I wieh to say that there is in .addition this evidence that the ma.tter lias
been unduly delayed. It was not introduced
in the House of Comnion until June 15, one
whole week after the date I mentioned. There
waa no reason for thet delay. Lest yeer the
Bihi wentL to a Committee, and thia year it
shoued have been brouglit down earliee ini
order that, if desired, it might have been sent
to a Committee of the Senate for further
consideration. Therefore I gay that the
evidence is dearly conclusive that the
sponsors of this Bil- are so directing their
footateps in the other Chember s to hring
about the defeat, and not the aucoess, of this
projeet.
In view of what the Min.istei, of National
Defence has said, I want to remind thia
House that the proposaïl ta build a railway
through the counties of Pictou and Guy»borough ta connect the districts in that section with the Inte-rcollonial, now the Canedian
National, la a very old story. Back in 1897
the then Premier of the province, Hon. G. H.
Murray, who took over the reins of office
fromn Han. W. S. FdekLing, issued hie manifest
to the electors, and one of the pledges hie
gave to the people of the easteru part of Nova
Seotia was that hie Governmrent would build
the Guysiborough Ra.iiwsy. I am apealcing
of matters of which I have personal knowledge. His Governiment was returned ta office,
and the Guysborough Railway was allowed toý
shimber wiÎthout any action being taken to
implement the pledge hie gave ta the people
of t-het Province.
In '1901 there were provincialb eleations
agaÀn, and under the leadership of Mr. Murray
this Guyaborough Railway project was put in
the forefront, in the man-ifestos, in campaign
speeches, and ini the press supporting the
Muray Governmnent. I remember that one
of the eppetas in the county of Pictou, which
is mueh interested in the project, wae: "Vote
for Dewar, Macdonald and Patterson axid the
railway." That was 24 years «ga. Patterson
and MacdonalId were elected, and the Gove.rnment was returned. I happened to be
elected in the place of Mr. Dewar, but I did
not have w'ith me sufficient force in the
Legisature ta prevenit the construcion of the
Guysborough railway, or the fulfilment of the
pledge in thait regard by the Murray Government if I deoired ta do go.
But I would like Vo asic why this gentleman,
who la now the Minister of National Defence,
lias himself lagged so long ini the coi-struction
of this raillway'-why he has &Uiowed so many'
years t4a elapse since 1901 without ever utriking
a tap an the Guysborough ralilway, and now
8-41J

cornes back, et this very late period, and
accuses Tory Senatars, forsooth, of being the
guilty parties in that regard.
That dace flot complete the hiétory. There
were Dominion elections in Nova Scotia ini
1904, and nothing having been donc in the
meantime, this reilway of course appes.red. on
the horizon of the political campaign. In that
year -there was a step taken. There was a
lergely advertised meeting dawn in one of the
districts through which the reilway would
run; there was a turing of sodË and the
wheeldng of wheei-barrowa, a sound very mucli
like the construction of e reilway, juat on the
eve of polling day; but after poling was over
the wheelbarrows were put safely away, and
the sod was ellowed Va remein as it was.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: What year was
that?
Han. Mr. TANNER: 1904. Two years laVer
Mr. Murrey again went to the country, and
of course, hie could flot do s0 without a
Guysborough. railway. Accordingly, in that
ca.mpaig'n, hie wen't acrasa fromn Halifax te
Dartmouth, I think with several brasa bends,
and et a well-advertiaed meeting, announced
that the contracta were ail ready to be signed;
that nothing was delaying the matter except
the transfer of the subsidies hy the Laurier
Government, which was then in power, from
one company ta the other; and the world
was assure-d that there should no longer be
any doubt in regard to the construction of this
railway. &o Mr. Murray rode into pawer again
on the van of the Guyaborough Railway.
But the history does nat finish there. The
Provincial Government laid down the pickaxe
and put aside the wheelbarrow, and eppealed
ta Ottawa, and in 1911 a vote waa put in the
Estimatea of this Parliament for the construction qf e raîlway in Guysborough. I
want ta give honourable gentlemen the facta
in regard ta that phase of the matter. Parliament was diasolved in 1911, on July 29.
Tenders for construction of this railway were
advertised for on August 12, the tenders ta
be received until September 15. The election
day was September 21. Tenders came in, and
af Ver the defeat of the Gavernimnent, on October 2, the tenders were accepted. But what
was the contract? The contract was for the
construction of a railway, noV fromn Sunnybrae ta Guyaborough, or fromn Sunnybrae ta
Country Hlarbour.
They had split it into
two divisions, and the section which was advertised was the section fram Guysborough ta
Country Harbour, which would be in a sense
like -building e railway fram Port Churchill
ta Nelson, and leaving the people who wished

SENATE
to reach that railway to drive down or to sail
up or to go by airship. It was simply to be
round about within the county, without any
connection with the main railway.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
first section.

That was the

Hon. Mr. TANNER: That was the first
section, and that was the section that was
advertised for the purposes of the election,
and was talked about as if it were the complete project which was going forward. When
the Government changed, that contract was
revoked by the Borden Government.
I have mentioned these details, honourable
gentlemen, not because I desire to discredit
this project, but simply to show to honourable gentlemen that if there is, as I say, an
atmosphere of scepticism or doubt in regard
to this project, it is only attributable to the
people who have been pretending to be the
friends of the project, but who have used it
for no other purpose than a political football
for electioneering purposes. In Nova Scotia
the matter was never heard of until the writs
were either issued or about to be issued. And
of course there is an election on now, and the
same hubbub is going on now and the same

accusations are being made about the Conservative Party in regard to this project.
I want to say that so far as I am concerned I am going to vote for the proposition.
I always supportcd it while I was in the
Legislature, and I did the best I could to
urge the Government of that Province to
display some measure at least of sincerity in
I support this proposition
regard to it.
becaue I think that the districts on their own
merits are deserving of railway communication. Agriculturally they are amongist the
most fertile districts of Nova Scotia; there
are large lumbering interests in those districts,
and there are important fishing interests in
that part of the Province. I am told now
on what I believe to be dependable authority
that there is quite an important industry
developing down there in a certain species of
spruce which is required in the United States
for manufacturing purposes, and that considerable quantities are beginning to go out
of the lower part of Pictou county and Guysborough county for that purpose. It is a
well-known fact that the fishing industry in
that part of Nova Scotia is an important
factor in the prosperity of the whole Province. The fishermen from Gloucester come
over to the same districts of the sea in which
the fis'hermen of Guysboroueh carry on their
work. Those Gloucester fishermen require at
least two days to make their port after filling
their schooners with the catch. Nova Scotia
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

fishermen could come into Country Harbour
in the course of a few hours, and if they had
railway facil.ities for despatching fresh fish to
the upper Province markets, they could easily
land it in Montreal and farther west points
more quickly than could the Gloucester fishermen. On its merits, therefore, I am supporting
the Bil from the local point of view.
I have also always supported this measure
because I have looked forward to it-and I
know the Borden Government looked forward
to it-as the beginning of a through line with
low grades that would eventuaily be the
means of more satisfactory transit between
the Island of Cape Breton and the western
parts of Canada. That also is one of the
reasons, I understand, why the management
of the raiiways are at present recommending
it. They propose, of course, to contruct a
cheap line of road at the beginning; but, from
my reading of their representations, they are
intending to build so that later on the project
which was in the mind of the Hon. Mr.
Cochrane and of the Borden Government in
1914 and 1915 can be put into effect, and to
make that a low-grade line from the farthest
end of Cape Breton through Nova Scotia to
the Western Provinces.
Now, I want to call the attention of the
House to the fact that after the change of
Government in 1911. when all this flamboyant
political action on the part of the people who
pretended to be the friends of the Guysborough railway had passed away, the then
Minister of Railways, Mr. Cochrane, took this
matter into his serious consideration. I have a
distinct personal recollection of interviews
taking place in that Province between the
ceople of those districts of Nova Sceotia and
Mr. Cochrane. I am quite well aware that
at the beginning he was not favourably disposed te the project, but he undertook to
look into it, and he did look into it in 1913
and 1914. and caused very careful and
asurveys and investigations to be
exhaustiv\e
made on the line of the proposed railway.
Honourable gentlemen who desire to study
the iatter will find references to what I am
saying in the House of Commons Debates of
They will find there the statement
1914.
by Mr. Cochrane of the results of his investigations. of the fact that he had been able
to liscover a very low-grade line equivalent
to anything on the Grand Trunk Pacific.
Honourable gentlemen will also find there Sir
Robert Borden, the then Leader of the Government. practically undertaking that the
claims of castern Nova Scotia in regard to
the construction of this railway would receive
careful and sympathetic consideration.

JUNE 22, 1925
The resui1t of alit that was thaît in 1915 the
Borden Goveremenit undertook to begin the
construction of the raillway. $1,000,000 wue
placed in the Appropriatien Act for 1915, aund
I have no dou.bt that if the war had not intervenad, wi'th oAi its terrible conditions, the

,Now, 1 arn aware t.hat laat year, wlien -the
Ranlivay Committee of this House considered
this Bill, rqpresentativoe of the rai.lway mainagement appeuared before the Comnmitutee, and
that one of them eventually killed the project.
My friend the MieDater of National Defence
very careifudlv avoided th&t f set. It is a fact,
however, end the minutes -of the Committee
show that on Wednesday, Jýuly 2, Mr. H. H.
Macleod, who, I judge from the annual report
of the National Railways, holds a very higli
an.d responsible position on the Executive of
those railways, auppeared before -the Commîttee, and~ prsuctically, andl in fact in worde.
damned the proposidIon. 1 do not desire Vo
detain the House by reading ahi of the staVeMents which were, made before -the Committee,
and 'will content myesIf with readfing one or
two. Mr. Macleod was asked: "le that the

so fer as the Senaite was concerned. 1 expected -My honourable frienud (the Leader ouf the

tc, the Committuee last yeur.
Now, honourable gentlemen, 1 have nlot
much -more te say. In view of the facto I have
stated, andl whiech I believe can lie veeiified,
there are good commercial. reasons why the
people of FEtern Nova Scotia shou-ld be provided with raiiway commun joations. They
have becun inuduuced for 30 or 40 yeare Vo hotieve, that they were entitIed tVothlat communicatuion; they have heen promised ài over
andl over again; andltlhe promises of the Governments before 1911, whieh unfortunately
proved to have th-eir fou-ndation upon eaund,
were imnplemented by the assurance of thst
level-deadeal mani, now departed, andl whom
we ail ragret, the Hon. Frank Cochrane, and
by the then eminuent Leader of the country,
Sir Robert Borden. I arn very îoi to believe
thet those gentlemen end their coifleegues
weuld have presented a project of tJhis kind
to Parlia-ment unlese Vhey believeal there were
econombo andl comumercial reasons for its construction.
Another reason that I have in my mimd
why Vhis projeot ehoulal receive favourable
consideration je Vhis. Paxriament je in a very
compassionate frame of mind at the present
tlire, not only in the other House, but in
this. There je in the Estimates whicb have
passeal the other Hou8e a gift of 11,300,000 for
t.he construction of a grain elevator at Prince
Rupert, where no grain elevator je needed at
ail, andl where there je abeolutely no justification for the expenditure of one dollar. Yet
1 fancy that money witl be voted not only
by the otlier House, 'but probably hy this.
Hon. Mr. DAN13URAND: Doee my honourabte friend gpprove of the vote for the
grain elevator at Halifax?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: There you have a
thriving, busy community; there the railway
management says a grain etevator je needed,
and it lias been considering the matter now
for two or Vhree yeare, and finalffy, after looking into it from every angle, lias decided tliat
it would be good business to build that grain
elevator. But, as my lionourable frienal knowe,
the only way the grain etevater at Prince
Rupert can be feal with grain is by Vaking it
away from Vancouver and carrying it 200
miles further than it would have to be car-

646

SENATE

ried to Vancouver. I amrn ot opposed at ail
to the developrnent of the ports of the West;
but I look upon Vancouver as the great port
of the W"est,-as the port that should be built
up; and I see no justification for the Government attempting to build u p opposition tu
Vancouver until Vancouver Las been put on

a footing Which will make it the admiration
of the whole of Canada. We have been very
generous to the city of Montreal in regard
to a bridge. Sorne verv large sums of money
are being voted out of the Federal treasury
for works in referen-ce to whicha if they were
proposed in Nova Scotia, I arn sure we would
be told to pay for themn out of the Provincial
treasury. However, we are in a generous, if
flot compassionate frame of mind in supplying
the city of Montreal with tbe money for the
proposed bridge.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The Government does flot give any rnoney.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: We bave $21,000,000
invested at Quebec, whicb is such a good
investment that it does flot pay one copper
of interest. I like Quebec; I arn always glad
to visit Quebec, and I like to see it receive
its dues. We have given it $21,000,000, and
now we are giving it $5,000,000 more. Sorne
bonourable gentlemen tell me this Guysborough railway wîll flot pay for the cost of
ruoning it-that it will neyer make any return. What about Quebec? Quebec gets
$21,000,000 plus $5,000,000, but it is flot able
to pay a cent of interest on the *rnoney, and
therefore that is a dead investmnent.
When
we put $26,000,000 into a dead investmnent in
the ýcity of Quebec, why should we tomn a deaf
ear to Nova Scotia when it asks for an investrnent of $3,500,000 for the Guysborough
railway? We have been eompassionate enough.
to vote $3,000,000 to the depositors of the
Home Bank. We have been careful enougii
to say that we eliminate ail semblance of
right-even that nebulous thing, which nobodv has been able to describe, "moral right
in equity."
It will go down in history, I
think, as an expression which no living man
understands except the man who made it,
and I doubt if he uanderstands it. At any
rate, compassion is the clear ground upon
wvhich we are voting the $3,000,000 and making
a gif t to the unfortunate depositors of the

Home Bank of Canada.
Now, I desire to arouse the compassion of
the honourable members of this House for
the people who live away down in the far
eastern part of Nova Scotia, where they have
been waiting and waiting and waiting for
thirty and more years for the sound of the
raýlwav whis'-tle.
[[on. Mr. TANNER.

Hon. L. C. WFM-STER:

How many are

there?

Hon. Mr. TANNER:

If there is no other

reason that I bave stated which will appeal
to honourasle gentlemen, then I a-sk them,
out of compassion for this Iong-suffering
people in that part of Nova Scotia, to vote
the tbree and a half millions in order that
they rnay obtain some m-easure of justice.
Honourable gentlemen, I do flot wish to
delay the leuse any longer. I would like
honourable members to elirninate from their
minds the id-ea which. I arn sorry to say,
bas been created, and to which I referred
at the begiinning of my remarks, that this
railway project 'bas no menit. I think it bas
reall and substantial merit, when it is considered aside from the partisan views with
which it bas 'been clouded for a great many
years. I trust that honourable gentlemen will
remember that there is a great deal of discontent in Nova Seotia, and in the Maritime
Provinces gene'rally. I arn sure they would
be astounded if they were to read the staternents which are being put out now from day
to day by the Liberal leader of the Government of Nova Scotiu, Hon. E. H. Armstrong,
who is voicing sentiments whiceh seern to me
to inýdicate that nothing short of a srnashing
of Confedei'ation and a separation from
Canada will satàqfy him. The grievances he
alleges against the Dominion are many and
great, and, so far as he is concernied, it would
appear that we are coming to the parting of
the ways. I do flot think-myself-the situation is quite so bad. I think perhaps hie is
exaggerating for the purposes of the election,
but I arn satisfied that there is really, throughout the province, a great deal of diiscontent,
and it is feit t.hat when matters coneerning
the Maritime Provinces corne up for consideration here, t.hey receive very short and
very unsym-pathetie sbrift. I would like honoura1ble members to have fair mýnds when
thev are voting upon this matter, to re-mernber what I have already stated as reasons
why this Bill should be supported, and to
feel that they should show by their vote some
deieto cultivate the good-will of that
Province.
Honourable
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
gentlemen, the honourable member who bas
just spoken made a rernark with regard to
the Minister of National Defence which
sheuld not he allowed to pass. He said that
the statement of the Minister of National
Defence was untrue. I do rot think any
honourable gentleman shoiîld make such a
remark with regard to a Minister of the
Cro-wn.

JUNE 22, 1925
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I amrn ot referring
to anything the honourable gentileman stated
in the House of Commons: I amn referring to
what he said on the stump.
The Hou. the SPEAKER: I will reed Vo -the
honouiable gentleman what 'Miay says:
It is obviously unbecaming ta permit offensive expressions against the character and conduct of Parliament to be used without rebuke; for they are not only
a comtempt of that high court, but are calculated ta
degrade the Legislature in the estimate of the people.
If directed against the other House, and passed over
without censure, they would appear ta implicate one
FHouse in discourtesy ta the other; if against the House
in whicb the words are spoken, it would be impossible
ta. overlook the disrespect of one of its own mcmbers....

And so on. It is perfectily itrue itha't -the
honourabile gendeman wae re<erring to something outaide the Eouee, but I dio not -tihink

Hon. ýSir JAMES LOtYGHEED: Honourable genitlemen, it je with some trpIation
that 1 apeiak upon thils Bik. I have a vivid
reeolleotioni of our brestmenit of it l1eet Sesion, a treabinenit iwhich I think wae àn accordanice with the evidence submitted to us. A
new feature of this Bill has been, presented teday. Thise proposai seeui to have dune servic~e ini this country for the dest thdiTty years,
on the -ove of eveÉry general electicm, whether
Provincial or Dominion, and if -we removed
it now from out the political arena by bu"di

take its place. When you consider the hidatorioa4d

This is a road 67 miles ini length, anid iît
ie proposed that the Dominion should spend
upon it $3,500,000, or $52,238 ýper mile. I could
quite appreciaite the cumipaeionate appeil of
my honourable friend fTrn, Piotou if the railways were duca prosperous condition, but when
we recali1 the unfortunate fact thaut we are
payinig over -a ýmillion dolars ta week on secount of the raiulway deficit, and thaît we are
contri'bu.ting about a million doillars a week
in additiona1 icapitalization on behaif of thie

Mr. Maoleod,.aippeared before us laet Session.
He was famuiliae with -the road, havuing in%)pected
every miïe of it at the special -request cd Mtr.
Hanna, then tihe General Manager. Mir. MacLeod reipoirted -against our enMtring upon- a
construotion of 'this nature. In 'view ef thie

on t.he eve of tW genexal election whieh is
-te take place in Nova Scotia, in specd.ing
three and ia hall mnillions of doliera te, influen1oc, the resubt one way or the ethe-r? If

I asked my honourable friend the leader of
the Goverament if, in the event ouf our
giving second reading to this Bill, he would
have it submitted to the Standing Committee
on. Railways, Telegraphe and Harboure, where
we might further investigate the wisdom of
building the road, and I understand' from
him thutt he je flot unwilling to do that. If
this Bill goes before that Committee, I feel
that additional evidence ought to be produced. If it je possible to cOnvince the
honourable gentlemen of that Commîttee. or
the honourable members of this House, that
we ehould epend this money, in view of all
the facts mentioned by'my honourable friend
from Pïctou and, by the honourable leader of

them nay; but in my judgment it le somewhat difficult; Vo eecure that evidence. However, I would say Vo rny honourable f riend
that wc on this side of the House do not

agree to thé second reading of the
Bill if we are not committed to its principle
and it je ta go before the Standing Comumitte

Hon. W ILLIAM ROCHE: Honourable
gentlemen, on thie subject, very interesting
Vo Nova Scotians, I would not like te be

SENATE

absolufely sulent. I notice that several honourable Senaters fromn Nova Scotia who are
familiar with the locality of the enterprise
projected are absent. The allurements of tha.t
political contest in Nova Scotia which bas
been mentioned may have attracted them.
At any rate. they are flot here to advocaf e the
construction of this railway from Sunnybrae
to Guysborough. and I take the liberty of
presenfing mytself in their place flot that I
can be ýo useful or so influential in advocating
the measure, but simply that 1 desire f0
express my pýersonal int.eresf in flic enferprise
whieh lias been delayed so long.
I was very glad to hear the explanafion of
my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Tanner) who
wais forn'erly of Pictou, but, having turned
bis eye farther west, is 00W resident in Halifax.
H1e has spoken upon two points: first, the advantage of the projected railway to flic railway svstem; and, secondly, the advantage f0
the inhabitanf.s of the district more f0 the
soufli, which is a very prolifie lumber region.
and enjoys no railway communication whaitever. The inhabitants of that district, in
view of the development of the lumber indusfry and the great possibilities of that
portion of the country, heretofore untouched,
thjnk that now is the opportune time for a
railway Io bie construcfed f0 assist themn in
their enterprise and in flic development of
that section.
The te.imony of a railway officiai before
the Comimittee lasf year, to whicha reference
bas been made, was directed, I think, against
the advisabulity of flic une as a railway projeet, rather than the possibulities of developing a large portion of the cou.ntry .for lumbering and other purposes. Consideration was
given. I f.hink, mainly to the connýection
between the Intercolonial Railway at New
Glasgow and the Intercolonial terminus af
fthe Strait of Canso, or the short ening of flie
route between those two points.
My lionourable friend, lafely of Pictou a.nd
now of Halifax, went back a littie into history.
I would suggeat to bim that it is not so
desirable and flot so, becoening, af this very
laf e stage of tbe Session, to go liaek into
history in order to prove who waà the lukewarma friend of fbis enterprise, as fa demontirate now wbo are ifs warm friends advocating
that if lie actuatlly commenced and completed. If is quife true that various Goverumente and authorities bave been convinced, firet
of aWl, that this project is a proper one, and,
secondly, thaf if ie so, deaired hy the: inhabitante that if might influence elections in thaf
pan~ of Nova Sco>tia-primarily and deinonstrably, the election in Pictou County, when
Hon. Mr.

ROCHE.

my honou-rable f riend was a candidate, as
w'ell as bead of the Opposition Party. Between flie honourable Minister of National
Defenoe and my bonourable friend from
Pictou, there bas been very keen rivalry in
flic past. I do nof know fliaf my honourable
friend could say that tbc Minister of Defence
hais been at any time less fri-endly than him»elf
f0 this projeef.
It was not purely an election
dodge, or something put forward as a bait
for tbe electors, in order tbat fbey mighit
vote for thlis parfy or for that. Those elections
are nof so numerous, in Nova Scotia as they
bave been depicf cd, and if was nlot a1ways
on the eve of an election fhat flue Su.nnybraeGuyaborough Une ivas proposed. If was always a popular measure. I intend to, support
it and vote for if on flic ground that if will
be a greaf advan'tage fa flie people of that
section, and also a great advanftage to the
trade of the counfry. My bonouraible friend
(H-on. Sir James Lougbeed) attacbed fo, this
project fhe unfavourable refurns froua tbe
wliole Canadian National rwilway eystem.
Tliere is a railway running fromn Haîlifax
f0 Musquodoboit. wbhicli was thouglit f0 be
an un'wise, a chimerical projeef, and whicb
is 110W ascerfained f0 be flie very best
payin-g portion of flic Infercolonial andi is
carrying flie precise classes of commodities
which are producesi in the section of country
which would lie traversed by the proposed
line.
The Infercolonial is diseussed as a lower
Province raîl'way at every Session of Parl-iament by represenfa-tives from tbe central porfions of Canada. I do nof know thaf fthe
represenfafives of flie West are very inimieni
fa this projeet, beca use fbey bave feit fhat they
wanted some littie donation in tbe way of
railrway expendîture fbemselves. But let if be
aýdmritted liaf flic Intercolonial Railway is
nof for the sole benefit of tbe Eastern Provinces. The Infercolonial produces more profit
for Ontario and Quebec flian if doce for tbe
Eastern Provinces,
because goods fromi
Onfario and Quebec are carried down and
distribufesi in the East. So, if tbere lie any
deficiency on flic Intercolonial Railway do
nof affrillute if fa thbe notion thaf fhact railway lias been esfablished for flic sole benefit
of flie Eastern Provinces. It binds Canada
togethler and is -a very great producer of
profif fa Quc.bec and Ontai.io.
Tbe charge Whicb my lionourable friend
from Picfou and Halifax indignanfly repels
may have a liff le affacliment or adliesion ta
flic Conservative Part y.
This SunnybraeGuysborougb projeet was debafed be.fore flie
Railway Commiffee, and 1 am fold thaf fliose

JIJNE 22, 1925
who are now its warm friends voted against
it. It was reported by the Committee, to
tbis House, and the report was adopted unanixnously. But I say now that we have passed
compassionately, and with prudence and
sagacity, votes for various portions of the
country, regarding them with eomplacency and
generosity, and with the feeling that we were
benefitting the country. I wouid urge honourable gentlemen flot ta reserve ail their
economie negations to a proposai to vote two
or three millions for the benefit of the poor
Province of Nova Scotia. Let us make it
part of that generoù's system which has been
accepted during this Session, and contribute
to our friends who have long been iooking
and ion-ging for this rail'way. Ail parties, Liberals and Conservatives, legal men and working men, and ail the inhabitants, have been
waiting for the construction of this road. Let
it be said that this Parliament now sitting,
passed this vote and gave to the people of
Nova Scotia this help, in the general interests
of the counitry.
Hon. JOHN S. McLENNAN: 1 would like
to take a moment to, expiain my position in
regard to, this Bill. I think muich shouid havp
been clone for Nova Scotia that has not been
done, and my objection to this Bill is that it
proposes to buiid miles of a railway that is
not part of any system, and not buiit on
grades which woiild make the high-class line
that bas been spoken of, that wouid be s0
advantageous, and that I shouId be giad to
support with ail my heart. But this Bill
wouid hinder work that .ought Vo be done,
that would give a proper return, namely,
bringing the eastern portion of the National
Raiiways to Sydney up to conditions and
grade under which the trafflo which orginates
pot only tbere but in Newfoundiand couid
be carried profitably instead of being carried
ovgr a trgck that has such curves and grades
that the more trafiýc they get the more unprofitable is the operation o>fthat section of
the Canadian National Raiiway.
Then I feel that this projeet is not sound,
because this vote will prevent a vote of money
for the bettei, acharme.
Then, again, in justice to, the district which
I particulariy represent, it seems to me that
from the raiiway standpoint it should have
priority. It is the second city in Nova Scotia,
the Iargest revenue-producing district and yet
$ydney and its environment, the terminus of
Iiitercoloniai Raiiway, the gateway to New<oundland, bas no adequate wharf facilities.
=0O,000 wouid give au enormous increase in
the power to distribute the goods of whfflesale
houses and inanufactories in Sydney and North

649

Sydney along the coast and into Newfoundland, and capture that trade, part of which is
a growing trade through the new industriesl
that are being established there, and through
the better conditions of the fish trade which
exist. Although this need has been brought
year af.ter year to the attention of the Governments and the Railway Commission, tho.
National railways and at one of the finest
seaports in the country without a wrharf, and
at thle other side of the harbour, at North
Sydney, with the most inadequate wharf
facilities. For this reason I think that that
devélopment of the Intercolonial shouid have
priority over a vote of money for a piece of
railway which ends in the woods, which does
not go to Country Harbour, which is or might
possibly be macle a fishing fflace of some
importance-a road. which has flot been
pianned with the proper grades to make an
economicai route to the East.
Under these circumstances I feel that I cannot support this Bill.
Hon. E. L. GIRROIR: Honourabie gentiemen, I think we ail have a desire to treat
this question apart from its poiitical bearings, and its influence on the Nova Scotia
elections. When I came into this Senate I
had a desire to treat every question on, its
merits, and to forget the politicai conditions
of my youth as far as possible.
One of the arguments used against this
undertaking by the honourabie gentleman
from Sydney (Hon. Mr. McLennan) is that
it would not iower the grade of the Inter.
colonial Railway. That was a very wellthought-out principle of the Hon. Mr.
Cochrane, who was formeriy Minister of Railways.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: But did we not
understand in the Railway Committee that
the grading preparecl by Mr. Cochrane had
been abandoned for a iower standard of constructionl in this case?
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: Be that as it may,
iny honourable friend goes further, and proposes to lower the grades of the Intercolonial
Railway by building a wharf at Sydney and
repairing the one at North Sydney. That is
the only argument he bas used, and the only
remedy he bas suggested for the present
situation in eastern Nova Scotia.
As I understand the feeling of this Pariament, it is wiiling to spend money to provide
raiiway accommodation for settiers who have

fas as 1 can, tihe rights of that vailuable

meant the central provinces, but the killing of
this measure would mean that the people of
Guysborough and Pictou counties could nlot

of placing their goods on the market, in

Hon. Mr. DANBURAND: Honourable gentlemen, 1 tdld my honourable friend, in answer
to his question, that I led. no'objections to
sending this Bill to the Standing Comffnittee
on Raiways, Telegrapha and Harbours. He
said a moment agoHon. Mr. GIRROIR: May I ask the Leader
of the Government one question? There bas
been some argument between myseif and the
member from Sydney (Hon. Mr. McLennan)
as te the change of grades on this road. The
meinber for Sydney states that the grades
as proposed by Mr. Cochrane do not obtain
in the priesent project. 1 would like to know
something about that, if the Leader of the
Government has the information at hand.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: You will get that in
Committee.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
1 know there
was some question of grade in Committee,
but my memory is not clear enough on that
point to give a definite answer.
Reverting to the suggestion that t.he Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs, and
Harbours would be entitled to further information on the menits of this project, I

am willing to do the bestb I eu te obtain any
,further evidence that my honourable fniend
indicates; but I would remind him that when
this Bill was previously under review ini the
Committee it was examined fromn ahl angles.
We had more than one sitting, and I remember sitting past midnight one evening
and hearing evidence fromn Mr. Cantley, from
Mr. McIsaac and froin other residents of the
district, as well as fromn the engineera.
I
quite distinctly remember the impression
made on the Committee by Mr. Macleod,
who lied inspected the whole district. I was
impreued with bis statement that there was
a valley-ýthe St. Mary Valley, if my memory serves me-for perhaps 25 or 27 miles,
which the hionourable gentleman fromn Pictou
(Hon. Mn. Tanner) bas mentioned as a very
fertile valley and geneTally well settled. Mr.
Macleod recommended the building of the
lins to that extent. With all the evidence
we had, it seemed that the Committee might
have agreed to the pushing of that branch
at least down to the end of the valley. Sunnybrae is but the end of a bnanch itself.
When we were consid-ering the extension of
branches for settiens and prospective settiers
in the West, I Vhought that the inhabitanta
of our oid Provinces who had been waiting
for the co-ning of a railway for haîf a century
or more should be given somne consideration.
V7 miles is quite a long haul Vo a railway.
Mn. Macleod explained that there was a
splendid Iumbering district crossed by the
survey, which represented what might be a
very considerable freight for the railway.
There were the three considenations: first
the valley extending for many miles with ite
inhabitants on each aide; second, the splendid
forest of good lumber Vo be cut, and, third,
the service of Vhs fishermen. We had quite
a lengthy discussion on the importance of
serving those fishermen and giving themn a
chance to send their product expeditiously to
market. On the whole, a fairly good case
had been made out, and there was a moment
when I thought the project would carry, or
at all events the 27 miles would be agreed
to; but the Committee decided othenwise.
The projeet was examined from ail angles,
and I confess that I do not know what further information I shall be abie to submit Vo
my honourable friend. We wili again have
before the Comniittee one of the nepresentatives of the railway company, who is regularly at hand,, and some representatives of
the district. Membens of the Senate who
know the lay of the land may be able to enlighten us somewhat; but, to tell the truth,
I do noV know exactly how we can throw
more light on the whole problem.

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DÂNDURAND

second reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable gentlemen will remember that the Senate approved of the
Treaty -which is referred tu in the preamble.
The object of the present Bill is simply to
empower the Governor in Gouncil to make
such orders and regulations as are deemed
necessary to carry out the provisions and
intent of the Treaty.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Has my
honourable friend any detailed recollection of
the Treaty? I remnember our dealing with it,
but 1 cannot recali just what were its ternis.
It eeems to me it was a Treaty with regard to

Hon. Mr. DANbURAND: We may find in
the preamble an answer to my honourable
friend:
Wberoes at Washington on the sixth day of June, one
thousand nine hundred and twenty-four, a' Treaty
between Mis Majesty in respect of the Dominion of
Canada and the United States of America, for the suppression of srnuggling operations along the international
boundary between the Dominion cf Canada and the
United States, and assisting in the arrest and pro8ecution of persons violating the narcotic laws of either
government, and providing as to the omission of penalties
and forfeitures in respect to the carrnage of alcoholie
liquors through Alaska into the Yukon Territory, and
for kindred purposes, a copyi of which lias been laid
before each Ilouse of Parliament....

Honourable gentlemen will remember that
we were granted certain privileges, in connection with the transportation of alcool
to the Yukon, over the prohibition terri.r
of the United States. There was -some recip rocal arrangement.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 'Wili1 the
Orders ini Council passed by Canada and the
regulations passed by the United States for
the enforcement of the Treaty be uniform?
What provision is there for ascertaining that
they arc? It is very desirable that there
should be no marked difference between the
regulatios of the two countries.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 take it for
granted thàt, as the two eountries have joined
in the Treaty, both will see to its application.
We are proceedihg to do sn. If we f ound that
the United States were remiss in their
duty, we would naturally take notice, but I
have no doubt that -the two countries, having
entered into an arrangement of this kind in
good faith. will carry it out.

EXCISE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 234, an Act to amend the Excise Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this Act
was formerly known as the Inland Revenue
Act, but by chapter 37 of the statutes of
1924, the titie was changed to the Excise
Act.
There was in the Act formerly a section
M2A relating to licenses Vo pack or cure
tobacco; this, however, was repealed in 1922.
Under the provisions of section 8, subsections (d) and (e) of the Excise Act, a
stemmer of tobacco would be classed as a
tobacco manufacturer and would require a
manufacturer's license, costing -S0 annually.
(See section 275.)

654

SENATE

The Canadian raw leaf tobacco industry is
therefore handicapped by the obligation of
compliance with the provisions of the law,
which were established for the governance of
the manufacture of tobacco and cigars, and
did not contemplate any such industry as the
stemming of Canadian raw leaf only.
There is every indication that a considerable
amount of business may be developed in the
exportation of stemmed Canadian raw leaf to
Great Britain, and the .British tariff gives
preferential treatment to such raw leaf when
grown in the British Dominions Overseas.
There would be no danger to the revenue
in granting such stemmers' licenses.
The quantity of Canadian raw leaf used
in tobacco and cigar factories in the Dominion has increased approximately 300 per
cent since 1900, and has nearly doubled since
1908.
Under this Bill the license fee to be charged
for such business is limited to the sum of
$2.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

showing the line taken by the President of
the United States in cutting down the cost
of civil government on that side of the line,
and, if so, whether the Government intend
to profit by the example given?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend knows that no reduction can take place
except in the controllable expenditure.
We
cannot reduce the uncontrollable; therefore
all our efforts must be brought to bear upon
that which is within our power to regulate.
For the past 48 hours I have been expecting
to receive considerable data from General

Hon. Mr. REID: I understand that at the

House of Commons, an Order in Council was
passed advising the Railway Board of the
position of the Government.
May I ask
if any further Order in Council relating to
that matter has been passed since them?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As far as I am
aware, there has not. There was a statement
in that Order in Council that consequential
legislation would have to be passed, and that
legislation was passed by this House yesterday. I will try to obtain further information
along the line of the inquiry of my honourable

GRAIN BILL
STATEIMT

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourabie
gentlemen, I undemstand that the G~rain Bill
is on its ws.y ta 1,his Chamber; but, in view
of a number of arnendments to the Bill, which
is a voluminous one, it must paBs through
the hands of the Law Clerk of the HouS of
Cammons. He muest put it into shape, send
the ane'nded. copy ta the Printing Bureau,
where the type is standing, I suppose, and
have the corrections made, before copies of
the Bill as passed by the Gommons can be
distributed ta honourable members of fihis
Chamiber. We carsiat expect the Bill this
evening, but a great effort will be made
ta 'have copies o~f it distributed by eleven
o'clock to-morrow morning, when we will proceed ta dispose of it as rapidly as possible.
If there is no better suggestion made, I suggest that our <Jommittee on Agriculture,
with some members, especially from the West,
added ta the Committee, to-morrow afternoon and evening look into the Bill. I
understand that tiiere are but f ew contentious
clauses upon which there je any serious
difference af opinion.
Right Hon. Sir GEOPqGE E. F0STER:
May I make a suggestion ta rny honourable
friend? This Bill, as my honourable friend
knows, is really a most important one, Many
of the members of ths House have had a
good deal ta do with grain leisIation in the
lower House before coming here. I myself
administcred. the Grain Act for tan or eleven
years, and, although I was neyer an expert
in the grain business, I did make myseif
master of the general features of it. Il understand that the present Bill je reelly a consolidation-practically a new Bill, and I have
not the least idea what changes have been
made or whether they involve any great
principle. If my honaurable friend would tell
us exactly what are the lundamental changes
i the Bill and how they affect the grain
business, I tliink it would help aur understanding of it, and miight reconoile us, if anything in the wide world can, to the humiliation
of having legisla.tion of this kind-thrown upon
us within the hast f ew hours of tlie Seonion.
I know my honourable friend lias a vast deal
of wosk now on band, and ma4ybe it would
be impassible for him ta 'du as I suggest,
but if lie or some good man in the service of
the* Government cauld put the imipartant
changes lief are us, we could conxcentrate upon
thhem. and ý think fairly get over the trouble.

65

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:. It was My intention that a representative of tlie Department which has ta do with this Act as well
as the Board wlio are here to, advise the
Minister, shouhd; be on hiand ta meet the Committee. They followed this Bill froln' beginning ta end for daya and weeks wlien it
was in the Committee of the oliher House. I
will ask them this even4ng ta, prepare themselves 50 that they may indicate ta the
Committee the important clauses upon whicli
there has been a divergence af opinion. Tlie
so-called standard clauses, which cantain no
principle, and most of which 'have been unamended, may be disposed of very readily.
I really believe that considerable wark can
be done in a relatively short space of time
around the Cammittee room table. We ail
know that if we start dïscussing an important
clause here, and everyone riscs ta put a
question as ta the effect af the clause, we
cauld remain here quite a f ew weeks. I arn
certain that aur Cominittee, by addressing
itseîf ta the solution of the prohlem, can in
a few haurs go thraugh the main clauses of
the Bill.
My hanourable friand speaks of the humiliating. situation Uiniwhich4 we iire placed.
When he lias been liera a few years langer,
ha wilh realize that we can proteot aur own
dignity very essily. I have had occasion ta
say that if honoura-ble mamibers who have a
knawladige of the warking af this Act go into
the Cornmittee and find that it wauld take
toa long to give the Bill seriaus attention,
and that it could well afford ta stand ovar
until next Session, I would not liesitate ta
withdraw the Bihl.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I presume it
will be withiýn the powers of the Gainmittee
ta hear athers than representatives ai the
Gavernnient or af the Grain Board?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes. It le not
within my pravince ta do sa, but I would

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT moved:
That the~ fees paid upon Bill K5, intituled an Act ta
incorporate Motual Plan Company of Canada be refunded to the solicitors, for the promoters, lems printing
charges.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

He said: Honourabie gentlemen wiii remember that the Committee advised the promoters of th-is Biii to drop it for the present
and bring it back next Session.
The motion was agreed to.

-Hon. Mr. Haydon.
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. HAYDON moved the second reading of theý Bill.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: XVouid the honourabie gentleman expiain?
Hon. Mr. HAYDON: Honourabie gentlemen, I arn sorry that I have noV by me a.ny
memorandum of explanation except what can
be gotten from the Biii itself. Lt is a Bill Vo
incorporate a number of gentlemen of the
cities of Montreai, Toronto, Winnipeg and
Vancouver as Customs bouse brokers. The
objects of the Biii are to fix standards of
skiil and competency for the members and
prom oVe efficiency in Customs House Brokers.
and for these purposes to hold examinations
and grant certificates Vo persons who have
passed such examinations. Other clauses provide for the holding of properties, the establishment of a head office and the appointment of a board of directors, and for the approvai of such by-laws. ruies, etc., as such
associations generally have. I sce nothing
in the form of the legisiation other than has
been frequentiy passed by the Parliament of
Canada with respect to such institutions.
The motion was agreed Vo, and the Bill
was read the second time.
Hon. Mr. HAYDON: I move that the Diil
be referred to the proper Committee.
lion. Mr. WATSON: Danking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. HAYDO-N: I do not think it
deals -with hanking. I think it is one for the
Misceilaneous Private Bis Committee.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I wouid like Vo ask
if there is anvthin1e in this Biii that wouid
prohibit anvone from acting as customs
bouse broker unless he were a member of
Hon. Mr. IIAYDON: I do not think so.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Does it
make Customs Brokers' organization a close
corporation?

JUNE 24, 1925
Hon. Mr. HAYDON: No, thé persas named
here, together with such other persans as may
become members of the Association, are incorporated under the name of Dominion
Chartered Customs House Brokers Association, hereinafter called "the Association."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Look at the
powers.
Hon. Mr. HAYDON: The powers and
membership of the Association are defined in
sections 2 and 3:
2. The purposes of the Association shail 'ho ta fix
standards of akili and competency for its members and
thereby promote efficiency in customs house brokers,
and for the said purposes the Assocation may throughout Canada,(a) hold such exammnations as are found expedient;
and
(b) grant certificates of efflciency ta persoa
who
havr passed such examinations.
8. The membership of the Association shail consist of
persons who have passed the prescribed examinations,
and of suth persona as the directors may admit as
non-certificated memnbers until such time as they have
passed the prescrulbed examinations, and of whose
qualifications and fitness 'the directors may approve.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would think,
honourable gentlemen, that -this Bill affects
s0 vitally the trade of this country that it
should go to the Banking and Commerce
Committee, rather than ta the Committee on
Private Bis.
Hon. Mr. HAYDON: I move that it be
referred to the Committee on Banking and
Commerce.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: I presume copies
of the Bill will be distributed; apparently
there are none at this end of the House.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 0f course, it
will have to be printed and dist.ributed ta the
members of the Committee on Banking and
Commerce.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Before this
Bill goes into Committee I would point put
an objectionable feature in the powers outlined in the Bill. It proposes ta vest in the
incorporators the riglit ta form an organization that will issue certificates as ta the fitnees
of those who may make application ta belong
ta the organization. The implication, therefore, is that those who do not belong ta the
organization, who do flot take out certificates,
are unfit ta act as Customs Brokers. There
is a very large group of men acting as
Customs Brokers t'hroughout the Dominion,
and they should not ho subj oct ta an implication of that kind, nor should they be forced
ta enter any organization that arrogatos ta
itself the right ta certify as ta the fitnoss of
mon ta act as Customs Brokers.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not, want
ta touch at ail the merits of the Bill; it may
have some virtue, and it may have somo
defects. I would suggest that the Banking
and Commerce Committee examine the Bill,
and if the Committoe desires ta caîl in its
promotors or others for more light, and. there
is not sufficient time ta make that inquiry,
the Committee may in its wisdom decide ta
postpone the mattor until next Session.

Mr. Dandurand.
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
roading of the Bill.
He said: This Bill is a consolidation of the
Act, and contains the wholo organization for .
the grading and inspection of grain. Most of
the clauses are ta be found in the Act, but
they are reproducod here because oif the
consolidation.
The clauses that may occasion some discussion and that may bo ta some extent, contraversial are few in number. They include
section 88, which refers ta the taking over of
scroenings; section 93, which croates a Grain
Appeal Board, replacing theolad Survey
Board; section 96, which dofinos new varieties
of whoat-Ambor Durum, Red Durum and
Kota. and also buckwheat. In the second
part, section 79 provides for a Grain Research
Laboratory. It does not initiato the work,
which is aiready in existence, and is due ta
the initiation and the wisdom of the right
honourable the junior ýmember for Ottawa
(Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster) when lie
was Minister of Trado and Commerce. Section
112 concerna the management of olovators.
Section 111, subsection 2, makos the provisions of the Act apply ta ail terminal
elovators. Section 116, subsection 5, covers
Godorich and Midland elevators. Section 140
doals with private elevators and inspection out
of private olevators. Section 143 concerna
sood grain olovators and pool country elevators.
Section 150 directs how country olovators shahl

RtEVISED EiiiTION

SENATE

658

on Agriculture of the other Chamber, which
sat for many days on this Bill, and. will
very likely be dealt with by a Special Committee of this House which I will move for
if this Bill gets its second reading.
Hon. A. B. GILLIS: Honourable gentlemen, I must claim the indulgence of the
House for a short time, even in the dying
hours of the Session. This measure is very
important, and many reasons could be assigned
for holding it over for another year, were it
not for the fact that the Bill is practically a
reprint of the Act of 1912, that the changes
it makes are not very important. It is true, we
have had the first draft of the Bill before us
for some time; but, knowing that it had to
run the gauntlet of the 'Committee of Agriculture of the House of Commons and also
of the House itself, and that many changes
might be made there, we were scarcely in a
position to deal with the matter intelligently,
and there was no great advantage in having
the Bill as printed at that time. In the second draft there were not many changes of
importance.
The Bill as we now have it makes certain
changes in the old Act which will probably
have some effect on the grain trade; but,
speaking generally, these amendments are not
of great importance.
The question of grain handling in Canada
has been a live issue for many years. During
the period from 1897 to 1914 we had no less
than 13 Commissions appointed to deal with
this question, some of them having been appointed by the Federal Government and some
by Provincial Governments. In addition to
those we had, a year or two ago, the Lake
Freight Rates Commission, and, finally, the
Grain Commission on whose recommendations
the Bill before us was drafted.
I happen to be very well acquainted with
the Chairman of this Commission, and I think
a better selection couild net have been made
than that of Mr. Justice Turgeon to deal
with this matter. He is a man of splendid
ability, a very capable man. He went into
all phases of the question as it applies to the
grain trade, both directly and indirectly; but
we find that, notwithstanding the very comprehensive inquiries they made, the Commission were unable to suggest any very
radical changes in the Act. I do not think
the grain-grower will receive a fraction of a
cent more for his grain as a result of their
deliberations, even if this Bill be passed. I
think the Government might have saved about
$200,000, the cost of this Commission. I have
not the exact figures, for my question on this
point which has been on the Order Paper
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

for some days is still without reply; but I am
safe in saying that it cost more than $200,000.
Honourable gentlemen, in looking over the
original draft of the Bill, will observe that
practically all the amendments proposed were
suggestions made by the Board of Grain Commissioners. liad the Government, instead of
appointing this costly Grain Commission,
called in the members of that Board, and
grain men who understand the situation, to
consult with the Minister of the particular
Department to which the subject appertained.
I think the same end would have been accomplished, and the amendments we have before us to-day could have been brought in
quite as well without that large expense. The
report of the Commission is a very important
one, and contains much valuable information;
and from that standpoint there may be some
little compensation for the amount of money
spent on that Commission, though Commissions as a rule have not been able to accomplish very much to improve conditions in the
grain trade.
The greatest help we have received in connection with the handling of grain in the West
has been from the installation of the loading
platform. The late Senator Douglas, who
was a member of this House, and had been
a member of the other Chamber, equally with
the honourable member for Assiniboia (Hon.
Mr. Turriff), worked in this connection, and
succeeded in establishing for the people of
the West the privilege of loading grain from
the loading platform. Of course, it is not a
very convenient way of handing grain, as it
involves a great deal of hard labour; but at
the same time it is very important to have
this alternative method of handing grain, as
the farmer having the advantage of a loading
platform can reach the elevator man and
probably make a better deal with him in
the way of rates, etc., than he could do if
corLpelled to deal through an elevator company.
There is one part of this report with which
I do not agree. It is with regard to what is
known as the Saskatchewan Co-operative
Elevator Company. The report goes on to
say, in reference to this company and the
United Grain Growers Company:
The companies fix their own prices, and they form
real competition to the line companies at points where
thev meet. The United Grain Growers have 311 country elevators in the three western provinces, the Saskatchewan Co-operative Elevator Company have 387
These two co-operative
elevators, all in Saskatchewan.
farner's companies have, therefore, 640 country elevators out of a tota-l of 3.926, approxianately 16 per
cent; and they operate at 640 elevator points out of
1.532: which means that they compete with the private
elEvator companies at 41 per cent of the country points.

JUNE 24, 1M2
This ia the point to which I want to draw
the attention of the House:
Ir. so far as the Saskatchewan Co-operative hs concerned, we are assured by its officiais that they have
always shaped their policy go as to seure better treatment for the wagon load seller by forcing up the price
of street grain.

Now, I have watched the operation of the
Saskatchewan Co-operative Elevator Company
for a great many years, and I must, say here
quite frankly that that statement is not correct. Let me give you a short history of that
concern. Away back in the years 1911 and
1912 there was considerable agitation in the
West for a better method of handling our
grain. I was connected with that movement,
and some of us thought that the establishment of Government-owned and operated cIevators would be advantageous. However, the
Government in power at that time decided
otherwise, and the Saskatchewan Grain
Growers Association, at its annual meeting
heid at that particular time, launched a
scheme for doing away with practically ail
the grievances complainýed of in that province
in connection with the marketing of grain.
That scheme was to form what were known
as locals. A certain flxed number of suhscribers were required to take stock in the
company, and a certain area of cultivated.
land was assigned to each local. The shareholders were called upon to pay for 15 per
cent of the shares, and the Government advanced the remainder of the amount required
to huild and equip an elevator. The Saskatchewan Government backed that company
to the extent of several million dollars. The
object, of course. was to obtaîn some relief,
particularly for the man who had to selI his
grain by the wagon-load.
As I have said, the Saskatchewan Cooperative Elevator Company is nothing more
or Iess than an ordinary elevator company,
doing business in the same way, paying the
same prices. and flot a fraction of a cent more.
A few years after this company started
business I happened to be the secretary of an
elevator company' in the town in which I
lived, and with it we had there two or three
elevators. Seven miles distant was the local
elevator of the Saskatchewan Co-operative
Elevator Company. At the ed of the season I had an opportunity of ascertaining the
prices paid by the Saskatchewan Co-operative
Elevator Company and also by the line elevators for every day from October until about
the end of March. After we had carefully
computed those prices we foued that the Cooperative Elevator Compaey had paid about
haîf a cent less during the whole seascn than
S--42J

659

had heen paid by the line elevators and the
clevator that we wcre operating.
This, I
thiek, is true of every elevator operated by
that Comnpany. It has provided accommodation, if it can be called accommodation,
to, a comparatively smati section of the
couutry. That being so, this statement contained in the report is, to, my mind, cntirely
unfounded and incorrect.
TPhe great diffi.ulty in tihe grain tirade ie tihe
grading. TJndier the ohanges made in tihe Act
we have No. 1 Hard, No. 1 Northern, No. 2
Northern, and No. 3 Northern. These -are the
statutory grades. But the people of the West
are suffering principa4ly in regard to the lower
grades, for which they are n-ot receiving proper
value. I have secured from tihe Exiperimental
Farm here in Ottawabthe reeufts of a test mnade
in January of this year as.to the value of
the productis of one buahd of wheat. Aooding to that test, the value of tihe three produots--flour, bran a.nd shorts-is as fo4lows:
No. 1 Noritheirn, $2.69; No. 2 Northern, $2.64;
No. 3 Nort.hem, 32.63; No. 4 Northern, 32.48;
No. 5 Northern, $2.42; No. 6 Northern, 32.41
You wîll sec from these figures tihat the difference ie value between No. 1 andl No. 6 is
28 cents.
ýNow let us look at the prices of whes,
during- October, Novem.ber and December of
last year. For No. 1 tihe averaige price was
$1.66. The difference beween No. 1 and No.
2. and betweeqi No. 2 andl No. 3, is comparatively small. So -lot us take No. 4, tihe average price of which was 31.44. From this y-ou
will see that there is not very cnueh difference
in the value of tihe producte of No. 1 and the
produnta of No. 4. The average price of No.
6 was $1.21. The figures show a difference of
45 cenît between No. 1 and No. 6 in. those
months of Ootober, November andl Deoember.
and a différence of 17 cents a bushedin No. 6,
l
as hetween tihe test made in Ja.nuary andl the
average price in the three mont-ha I have
mention-ed.
Taking the cash prices on the Winnipeg
Grain Exchange for the moni of -May, we
final that the prieS of No. 1 was $1.83j; No.
3, $1.75; No. 5, $3%9; and No. 6, 31.20; -or
a difference of 44 cents between No. 5 andl
No. 1. The difference between No. 6 and No.
1 was 63 cents, whereas, the dlfferenoe woubd
have been 28 cents id the grain-grower had
reoeived bis due aecording to the -tests.
,In addition to that, I have had occasion to
look up some tests that were -made at the
State Testing Mdl in Mi-nnee.po4ie, which show
the fodlowing results: The value of produote
from one bushel of No. 1 Northcrn was 31.60;
No. 2, 31.60. No. 3, 31.58; yet, tiie epread

SENATE

660

here varies as much as 3 iper cent, 4 per cent,
and sometimes 5 per cent.
Taking the oaf volume made fýrom the
same grades of wheat, we find that the loaf
from No. 1 was 1.970 cubic centimeters; that

from No. 2, 2.052 cubic centimeters; and that
from No. 3, 1.935 centimeters. which goes
to show that the bread-making qualities of
apmetical-ly equal in the 'three
the wheat were
grades.
A colour test shows the followsing percentages. No. 1, 97.5; No. 2, 97.5; No. 3, 97.7.
Now, I want to go back a little and refer
to an analysis made by the Territorial Government in 1904-5, <made when Dr. Elliott
was Minister of Agriculfure. This shows that
we are to-day liabouring under the same difficulties that we were struggling iagainet then.
At that time wheat was sent to the Guelph
Agriculitural College to undergo the test, and
the results showed the mililing value of the
different grades of wheat flour to be as follows: No. 1 Northern, 69.9 per cent; No. 4
Nortihern, 68 per cent; feed wheat-we had
no No. 6 at that itime-showed 66.2 per cent,
or only three points lower than the No. 1.
In the Columbus Laboratories in Chicago
a test made in 1904 showed the average values,
100 per cent standard flour, to be as
follows: No. i Hard, 96.4 per cent; No. 1
Northern, 95.5 per cent; No. 2 Northern,
95.9 per cent; and No. 3 Northern, 96.7
per cent. An analysis of stook-frozen wheat
was made at the same institution, which
showed that 70.7 per cent of flour was
obtained, which was equal to the percentage
recovered from No. 1 Hard.
There is in wheat a constituent known as
protein, which is claimed to be of great value,
and I believe that for milling purposes it is
extremely important. It is found that the
different grades of wheat contain practically
the same peroentage of this valuable content.
We find that No. 1 Northern contains 14.6
per cent of protein; No. 2, 13.31; No. 3,
13.39; No. 4, 13.79; No. 5, 13.99-almost
as much as No. 1; and No. 6, 13.37. This
shows very clearly that wheat for which the
grain-grower of the West has been paid
anywhere from 15 to 45 per cent less is
practically as valuable for milling purposes
as No. 1 Northern.

I have made these comparisons to show
the difficulties which have confronted the
:grain-growers of the West during all these
years. The great trouble is that they are
net receiving proper value for the milling
qualities of their grain. I must confess that
this is a difficult matter to deal with.
The wheat.growers of the United States,
of course, do not export raw wheat to any
Hon.

Mr. GILLIS.

extent, 85 per cent being ground at home.
Our difficulty in that regard is that we
have not sufficient milling facilities to ascertain the true milling value of our wheat.
I understand that the Minister in charge of
the matter in the other House has given us
some encouragement in regard to having
wheat properly tested from the milling standpoint, with a view of giving to the producer

the proper value of his wheat. To-day wheat
can be tested for moisture content; but,
apart from that, owing to the rush in shipping the wheat and the lack of facilities
offered we are unable to ascertain the real
value of our grain. This is wlhere the whole

trouble exists. There should be some regard
paid to the wei-ght of the wheat. A case
was brought to my personal attention last
fall of a man who had brought in a load of

wheat which weighed 63 pounds to the bushel,
and which was graded No. 5. That is only
one instance showing how we are losing

heavily in the lower grades. What should
be done by the Government of this country,
even if it is necessary to tax the farmers in
order to do it, is to provide some means for
testing the wheat. The farmers of the West
have lost millions of dollars because they
did not get their rights in this respect. It
is the duty not only of the Federal Government, but of the Provincial Governments, to
do everything possible to encourage the milling industry, and thus to enable the farmers
to get the real value of their grain.

Hon.

Mr.

WILLOUGHBY:

You

will

remember that the Commission recommended
an export duty.

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: I am just going to deal
with that.
The Minister also touched upon the question of transportation and the shipment of
grain, and incidentally he made reference to

the Hudson Bay Railway.

Of course, I un-

derstand that the mere mention of that railway to eastern members is the proverbial red
rag to a well-known animal. I may tel! this
House, however, that the people of the West
are going to have that road completed. The
country has already spent some $15,000,000
to $20,000,000 upon it, and surely it would
be the part of wisdom to complete the work.

The completion of that road would be

a

better way of developing the resources of the
West than anything else that could be undertaken. A certain amount of land was set
aside for the purpose of building that road,
but the trouble is that we are not able to
get the Government to complete it.
We
have heard in this House of heavy expendi-

JUNE 24, 1925
tuires pa.ssed for a useless elevator at Prince
Rupert, for another elevator equally useless
at Halifax, of $5,000,000 for the Quebec
Harbour, and of various other undertakings.
But here we have a project, agreed long ago
by both parties, both of whom are bound
to carry it out. The completion of that work
requires only $1,500,000 or $2,000,000, and the
delays are more than 1 can understand, and
I sincerely hope that the work will be hrought
to a speedy conclusion.
Now 1 want to deal just for a moment
with the recommendation made by the Commission with regard to an export duty on
wheat. The Government has failid tc take
action in this matter, though, situaten as we
are to-day, we are in a position to dictate
terrns to the American people. In what is
known as, the hard wheat beît of the United
States-the Dakotas, Minnesota and Montana-the growing of corn is taking the place
of wheat-growing, and consquently the yield
of wheat is diminishing from year to yezar. In
only a cornparatively short time that portion
of the UJnited States as a wheat-prcNducing
country will have disappeared from the rnap,
and the Canadian West wilI practically control the supply of that kind of wheat. Ultimately, owing to the United States farmers
having given up the cultivation of wheat,
and owing to the spread of noxious weeds, the
cultivated portions of the Prairie Provinces
will have to be- depended upon to produce
the wheat. For a number of years past the
United States has been importing our wheat
to a considerable extent. Last year I think
8,000,000 or 10,000,000 bushels were irnported
into that country in bond, and that wheat
went in practically free of duty. An export
duty on wheat I think would be of great
henenit in inducing the Americans to open
their rnarkets to us. During the past ten
years that might nlot have been of very great
value to us, the price of wheat being higher
heme than in the United States. Last year
the average price in Canada was five or ten
cents a bushel higher than it was on the
Chicago market. Much of this cry of getting
the Arnerican market for our wheat has been
The

price of July wheat in Winnipeg to-day is
11.3 cents a bushel higher than it is on the
Chicago market. I think the expert duty
recommended by the Commission would ha of
great advantage to the people of this country.
Why should we allow our wheat to be sent
to the United States practically free of such
a duty?

661

I waa gliad to see the (reference made by
the Commission 4û the Winnipeg Grain Exchange. 'Mis institution hua bren Jooked
upon as one of the, rnost iniquitous organ-izations thwt ever existed. For everything relating to the prices of grain, and everything connected with the grain trade thMr was advere
to the interests of the farmers, thre Grain Exchange was socused of being responsible. Noiw,
as a matter of 'faot, the Winnipeg Grain Exchange is a good institution. It is absolutely
nece9sary for us to 'have tihut Exdhange in
order to carry on the grain business of the
West, and I arn glad that the atmosphere has
been cleared so that, tihe people wibl uindSistand bhat the many things of which. tihe Exchangwe fias'been accmsed 'have not 'been taking
place.
It has bren proposed te send this Bill to a

are 'not df great coneequence, I ehould 'think
that in order to save tirne, whidh is somewhat
linited, we- might deal1 with it in Cotmmittre
of the Whole House. If it is reiferred to the

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Before this Bài

my opinion as to the m-anner ini whioh we
should dea1 with the Bill afterwarde. Only
two or three olauses w'ill really be matters for

those -clauses, I muet confess that I arn veiy

HOME BANK DEPOSITORS RELIEF
BILL
SENATE AMENDMENTS

INSISTED UPON

The Senate proceeded to consider a Message
from the House of Commons disagreeing to
the amendments made in the Senate to Bill
182, an Act for the relief of the Depositors
of the Home Bank of Canada, for the following reasons:
1. Because the said Amendments, which consist in
chang'ng the title and adding a preamble as well as
new clauses, are fore:gn to the Bill passed by the
Hiuse of Commons on the 10th of June, 1925, the said
preamble setting out that certain representations have
been made to the Governor in Council and that the
Government's moral responsibility to the Home Bank
depositors is not admitted, and also defining the principle on which pecuniary aid may be afforded to a
limited number of creditors-Ihereby giving expression
to recitals on behalf of the Cabinet and the House
of Commons which have not been authorized either
by the Government or by the House of Commons.
2. Because Clause 2 of the Bill, which had been passed
by the House of Commons on the recommendation of
the Crown, and which provided that the amount
mentioned therein be voted for the purpose of paying
the Home Bank depositors such proportionate parts
of their deposits as they would respectively be found
erttitled to in the liquidation proceedings, bas been
struck out and new clauses have been substituted determining another mode of payment based upon a different
principle and fixing the amount to be paid at a sum
not to excçed $3,000,000, besides changing the proportion for the distribution of these public moneys and
es!ablishing classes of persons who may be paid or
denied payment, according to the provisions of the said
now clauses.
3. Because clause "A" added to the Bill provides for
the appointment of a Commissioner and the organization of a lengthy and costly procedure, thereby entailing a large expenditure which the Senate bas no right
to make a charge upon the public revenues, and which
oould only be authorized if it had first been recomHon. Mr. DANDURAN'D.

mended by the Governor General and voted by the
House of Commons under Sections 53 and 54 of the
British North America Act.
4. Because it is provided by Clause 7 of the said Bill
as ,passed by the House of Commons that "The
Governor in 'Council may raise by way of loan, temporary or otherwise, upon such forn of security and
upon such termas and conditions as the Governor in
Council may approve, such sum or soins of money as
are required for the purpose of making the payment
authorized by this Act, and any saum so raised shall
form part of the Consolidated Revenue Fend" and the
rai'sing of any loan as a charge upon the Consolidated
REvenue Fund is the undoubted and sole privilege of
the Comnions,-the Senate having no right to alter the
saine, whether by increase or reduction.
5. Because the title, principle. policy and economy
of the said Bill as passed by the House of Commons
have been completely altered and a new Bill has been
substituted by Their Honours, and the action of the
Senate in the premises is contrary to the Constitution
and against the accepted principles of British Parlianîcltary practice.
6. Because the House of Commons, adhering to the
British North America Act and the fundamental principlc enbodied in Rule 78, cannot renounce its inalienable right to intiate and regulate the voting of all aids
and supplies granted by Parliament and it bas never
acknowledged the right of the Senate to make amendments to Money Bills.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Honourable gentlemen. I need not recall to this Chamber the
procedure which has been followed in connection with the examination of this Bill on
the second reading and in Committee. I
desire only to state that the Senate undoubted1y laid down a different principle from
that contained in the Bill as introduced in
this Chamber. when it adopted the amendments to which the House of Commons
dissent. I do not desire to weigh the reasons,
pro and con, but would draw the attention
of honourable members of the Senate to a
feature of the decision of this Chamber which
should perhaps be reconsidered.
The Bill came to us with the declaration
that the depositors and others creditors of
the Home Bank were entitled to compensation
through a moral claim in equity arising out
of the situation which prevailed at the time
the matter was brought to the attention of
the Government, that is, during the war. The
House of Commons were unanimous on that
point, and the reason actuating them was
probably the intention to limit to war conditions the compensation that could ever be
claimed in future by the establishment of
this precedent. It has been argued that the
Senate, taking a different view, substituted
for the principle I have just described one
which is of far greater extent and import than
that which was contained in the Bill It is
true that this Bill creates a precedent, but
one which is so exceptional that we hope it
may not arise within the next hundred years
-a war condition.

.JUNE 24, 1925
While the amendments of the Senate,
which involved an alteration of the preamble,
B3ase the vote upon an act of compassion,
I draw the attention of this Chaxnber to the
fact that, if we reject the moral claim in
equity and put our contribution on the beaui
of compassion due to sufferers, we open widely
the door in future to ail kinds of claims that
may arise through a calamity that may befail
a large but restricted group of the community.
This is a strong argument that is made
against substituting the compassionate feature
for the moral dlaim in equity, and I bring it
to the attention of this Chamber. Mainly for
this reason 1 intend to move, and do move,
seconded by Hon. Mr. Watson:
That the Senate, while reaffirming its right to amnend
money Bills, as defined ini and by the unanimous resolLition of the Senate of May, 1918, dedlares that it doth
flot insist upon its amendments.

Now, by the right (if the Senate I intend
to stand. It has been challenged, and it is
challenged by the resolution which comes to
us from the House of Gommons. When 1 had
the honour three years ago of rising for the
first time from this seat in this Chamber,
I declared that I accepted the principle contained in this resolution, and that during my
occupancy of the office which I hold I would
not abridge that resolution by any aet of
mine.
We are now facing the challenge of the
House of Gommons as to the right of the
Senate to amend a money Bill, and I believe
that the message which is before us refers
to a resolution of the House of Gommons
defining what it believes to be its juriediction.
In answer to that definition by the Commons
of their right f ully to control money Bills, I
cite the unanimous resolution of the Senate
defining what it believes to be its rights.
With this reservation as to, the message which
we received, I move as I have read.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, as this Chamber well knows,
when this Bill was first introduced by my
honourable friend on behiaîf of the Goverument, I supported the Bill s presented, and it
received a fair measure of support upon this
aide of the House. It became evident during
the discussion that it was very doubtful if the
Bill as presented by the Government would
pass the House. 0f course, this presented to
our minds a very serious problem. There was
a degree of sympathy felt on behaîf of the
unfortunate depositors who suffered so largely
through the failure of the Home Bank, and
finally my honourable friend, as a solution of
the difficuity, and I presume with the view of
something being done on behaîf of the deposi-

Ubj6

tors, suggested that the entire subjeet should
be referred to, the Committee of the Whole,
without our cominitting ourselves to the
principle of the Bill, and that we should hear
the liquidator upon the subject, on account
of his wider knowledge upon the matter than
any of us in this Chamber possessed. The
resuit was the Bill which was sent by this
Chamber to the House of Comnmons..
Now, the main difficulty which seems to have
been elaborated upon in the reasons submitted
by the House of Commons to the Senate is
the fact. that we have superceded the principie of moral responsibility, which the Government wants to assume, by making provision
for a compassionate allowance. Let us for a
moment analyze the question whether the
government aasumed for one moment a moral
responsibility in this Bill. I say .positively
that they have flot. Under what principle did
they fix 35 per lIent, if there was a moral
responsibility? If there be a moral responsibility for the payment of a debt or obligation, is it at ail logical that the person
assuming that obligation should scale it down
to a certain percentage? It is quite manifest
that the Government did not; recognize it as
a moral responsibility, but regarded it as a
compassionate matter, and therefore scaled it
down to 35 per cent. Is that not as obvious
as the sun that shines at noonday?
If there was a legal liability, that legal
liability was for 100 per cent. If there was
a moral responsibility, that moral responisibility was for 100 per cent. Where is the
distinction between the one and the other?
What is the process of reasoning by which
we can discriminate between the two, and
scale the grant; down to 35 per cent from 100
per cent? Why, honourable gentlemen, it is
simply an evasion, simply an equivocation,
simply a play with words, merely finding a
pretext for the purpose of supporting the position which they have taken.
The reasons submitted to the Senatc deal,
with apparent sincerity, with the question as
to our having departed from the principle of
the Bill. But what is the principle of the Bill?
The fundamental principle of the Bill is that
relief be given to the depositors of the Home
Bank. Is not that the main object of the
Bill? la there any principle that stands out
more prominently or more dominantly than
that the Government of Canada shoulcL afford
relief to the depositors of the Home Bank?
Why, honourable gentlemen, this was the
fundamental principle, the basis of the Bill,
and none other; so that it is only resorting
to what I might cali constitutional refinement
to advance reasons such as those embodied

664

:SENATE

in these reasons in which the Commons charge
the Senate with departing from the principle
of the Bill.
As ta the war, it had flot much ta do with
tematter. It certainly had nathing ta do
with the Bill. True, this failura took place
during the war, but it would have taken
place whether thare was a war or not. The
war was flot the cause of the failure of the
Home Bank. The war is flot the cause of the
Gavera ment coming ta the relief of the depositars of the Home Bank. This is simply a
subterfuge ta find some ground of difference
against the position taken by the Senqte.
I need not dliscuss the, question of this being a maney Bill. My honourable friand and
mvself. and in fact bath sides of the House,
agrea upon the right of the Senate to deal
with a money Bill, and to reduce the amount.
It seems ta me that this was a compromise
measure. It was said, and fraely said in many
'circles. that the abject of the Government in
bringing in this Bill was that it should ha
lefeated in the Senate. I do not chare the
Government with any such intention, oî with
hav ing any such motive.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAýND:

Heaxr, hcar.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But if the
Government is not preparad ta accept a Bill
of this kind, knowing the very strong position we have taken in raAiieing the amount
ta that provided for in aur Bill, thon the relection of aur amendments may lend color
in certain circles ta the suggestion that there
\vas a desire that the Bill should fail ta the
ground-that it should not pass Parliament.
It seams ta me, honourable gentlemen, that
under the circumstances, with the division of
opinion that prevailed in the Senate, there
was nu other solution ta the problem which
confrontad us--a difficult problem it wasthan that embodied in the Bill. The lines
seemed to be very strictly drawn between
those east of Ontario and those in and west
of Ontario, and 1 must say it gave me considerable thoupht as ta whether it was passible ta pass the Bill as it came from the
Commons. I for ana concludad-and 1 think
mnany of my colleagues who viawed the inatter
in the same light as myseif concluded-that
the only hope of bringing relief ta the depasitors of the Home Bank was through a
compromise measure such as we have passad.
I hope, therefore. that the Senate wihi insist

Tell us what an
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
equitable claim is.
Hon.

Mr. BELCOURT.

I am trying to
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
tell you. I have been trying for ten minutes,
but you will not let me do so. The equitable
claim in this case is that the Minister of
Finance, thinking, and possibly rightly, that,
the interest of the country being paramount,
it was better to let this Bank get into deeper
water rather than have it go into liquidation.
That entailed the implicit obligation to compensate these people. In other words, the
Home Bank depositors were told: "It is true
t
that you are going o suffer additional loss
by not having liquidation of the Bank now,
because the loss will be greater in a year or
two than it is to-day; but the national
interest demands that you should not insist
upon the liquidation now, and for my part
I am not prepared to give it to you." That
is unquestionably the evidence. I do not say
that Sir Thomas White was wrong; I do not
say that he was right. I do not quarrel with
him. I do not question his motive. He may
have been absolutely right in putting above
the interest of the depositors of the Home
Bank the interest of the State. I do not
dispute that, but I do say that that is the
situation created by what ocourred, and to
my conscience and my legal mind there is a
clear implication that these people, being put
to a greater loss by reason of what happened
at that time, would be entitled to come to
the Government and on equitable grounds
ask for compensation. That is why I say
there is an equitable claim. I may be wrong,
but I hope I have conveyed clearly what is
in my mind, anyway.
Now, if we had followed the principle which
guided the House of Commons, we would
not have estaliblished any precedent at all.
The precedent is in this instance, I take it.
the most serious consideration with regard to
this Bill. A case like this wili hardly arise
again. It is almost impossible for another
such case to occur, but if it did arise under
similar circumstances, there would be another
equitable claim whicli ought to be seriously
considered by the Government.
What has the Senate donc? We have said:
"There is no moral claim, there is no equitable claim, and there can ertainly be no legal
claim, but we are going to allow compensation
to these people on com:passionate grounds."
I say the Parliament of Canada cannot be
moved by compassionate considerations. The
Parliament of Canada has no power nor
authority to deal with this or any other
matter on purely compassionate grounds. We
are trustees of the people's money and we
have no riglit to appropriate it except for
purposes in respect to which power has been
delegated to us.

JUNE 24, 1925
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: What about the Halifax
grant, at the time of the explosion? That
case was dealit with on compassionete grounds.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Did we not vote
$100,000 to San Francisco?
Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP: What about

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Parliament can do anything.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I am not one of
those who subscribe to the doctrine that
Parliament or the Legislatures can do anything.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They do.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: There are laws
other than those which we make. There is
the Divine law, which we ail adopt, and there
is the natural law, which has and ought to have
a good deal of effect on legislation-a great
deal more than most people admit. The
Government or Parliament with unlimited
power does not exist on this earth. There is
a limit to legislative authority.
Now, let me proceed. I say that by putting this Bill on compassionate grounds you
are opening the door wide to anybody who
may ever suffer in the future. Banks, railway
companies, all quasi-publie institutions, will
have a right to come to this Parliament and
on compassionate grounds ask for compensation.
Mr. honourable friend who leads the Opposition (Hon. Sir James Lougheed) said: "This
is inconsistent: if there is an equitable claim,
it should be for 100 per cent of the loss."
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No; I said
moral claim.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Or moral claim.
I do not care which you call it, whether
equitable or moral. My honourable friend
claims that because only 35 per cent of the
actual loss is being paid, this makes the
whole thing illogical. I say no. It must be
admitted that the Home Bank in 1916 was in
a hopeless condition. It being in that condition, there was unquestionably a loss for
which the Government at that time was in no
But, because of the fact
way responsible.
that liquidation did not take place at that
time, the loss became greater. The only
equitable ground upon which the depositors
may base their application to the Government
is that subsequently to 1916, by reason of
there being no liquidation at that time, they
were put to greater loss. The amount of the
increase in the loss is the only part for which

667

there may be and is an equitable claim. The
difference between the loss in 1916 and the
greater loss in I think 1921, at the time the
Ban'k closed, it is impossible to ascertain.
The parties and the Government got together.
Those who represented the depositors agreed
that 35 per cent would probably represent
the actual loss which can be traced to the
non-intervention of the Government in 1916,
and 35 per cent was agreed upon. In what
way is that illogical or inconsequential? I
submit that the compensation must necessarily be limited to the extent of loss caused
by the refusal of the Government to allow
liquidation.
My honourable friend said also that the
war was not the cause of the failure of the
Bank. I do not think anybody said that it
was. I certainly did not say so, and I do not
now. It is quite evident that it was not the
war that caused the failure of the Bank.
But it was because of the war that this Bank
was not liquidated when it ought to have been.
Again, I have no fault to find with the
decision. The resultant additional loss was
considered necessary in the national interest
by those who had the responsibility at the
time. I do not quarrel with that, but I do
say that it was because in the opinion of
the Government of that day it was the paramount interest of Canada that no bank
should fail. It is because of the war, in that
sense, and in that sense only, that a claim
can now be put forward on equitable ground.
It seems to me that the position taken by
the House of Commons in the Message which
they have sent to us is absolutely correct in
logic and as a matter of legal construction or
I think this House by
interpretation.
approving of the voting of money on principles
other than those which moved the House of
Commons, committed an error. I think we
should have supported the Bill only on the
ground that there was an equitable claim.
The fact that we put the vote on conpassionate ground justifies the action taken
subsequently by the House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. REID: Does the honourable

to interfere with Money Bills? I understood

Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: . Honourable
gentlemen, I would like briefly to state why
I cannot agree with the honourable the senior
member for Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt). I
think I may say without exaggeration that no
piece of legislation coming from any legislature
has been received with more widespread favour
throughout the land than the Bill as redrafted here for the purpose of giving compassionate relief to the depositors of the Home
Bank.
I think it is net going beyond the
truth to say that two-thirds of the press of
the country, if net more, approve heartily of
the stand taken by this House and the manner
in which the relief measure has been worked
out as a result of our deliberations.
That is
so far as the public in general are concerned.
As to the interested parties, the depositors
themselves, 47,000 of them out of the 53,000,
if I an net mistaken, were to get, by the
modified measure, exactly what they would
have obtained under the original Bill. They
were in exactly the same position as before.
That is the first point.
As to the second point-and remember,
honourable gentlemen, it is only with regard
to this second point that there is a divergence
of opinion between the two Houses--on the
6,000 remaining depositors this House imposed
a new condition, namely, that they should
prove their need in applying to Canada for
relief.
The principle adopted in another
place was that, need or no need, the money
should be paid, not in full, but to the extent
of 35 per cent. In other words, this House
stands for the protection of those who are
in need, whereas the other House stands in
the extraordinary position of defending those
who are net in need. The position in this
respect is, it seems to me, as clear as it could
possibly be.
Now, honourable gentlemen, we have to
choose between two principles in dealing with
trust funds. We are dealing with the funds
of the people. For my part, I much prefer
the principle adopted by the Senate, that of
giving only to people who are in need.
One thing has struck me very forcibly: it
is the role played by the Government in all
this. Before this Bill was drafted in the
other House the Government could have
chosen two ways of dealing with the matter.
It chose one: it wanted this House to be
unfettered.
The Prime Minister said that
this measure must rin the gauntlet of this
higher tribunal.
If I may be allowed, so

the thoughts

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The honourable gentleman cannot go further than make
his affirmation, because it bas been laid down
that a member of one House cannot make
a citation from a speech of a member of the
other House during the same Session.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I think the honourable the leader of this House is right. I
recognize net only his efficiency in regard to
the rules of the House, but his prudence in
now closing my mouth and preventing the
words before me from being uttered. Suffice
it to say that the Prime Minister thought
that he was making his position very much
stronger before the country by sending the
measure here in such form that the Senate
could deal with it as it saw fit.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
I can quote the
page in Hansard as being 4139, and any member who wants to be edified as to the conduct
of the Government can refer to that page.
Now it has come to pass that this measure,
sent to us in such a way that we could
freely deal with it, after having been improved by us to the extent that it now receives the unanimous approval of the people
of the land, meets with a rebuff from the
Government in no uncertain tone.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
of Commons.

And the House

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
Yes, the House
of Commons. I believe I am prevented from
criticizing anything that happened in another
place, but I reserve my own judgment as
to that conduct. What was done, honourable
gentlemen? The Bill has been returned, and
attached to it is a message asking us to forget completely the Home Bank Bill, and to
enter the arena and fight the -old battle
waged for ahl time, between the prerogatives
of the popular House on the one side and
those of this House on the other. From the
first paragraph to the last, the message repeats, in different ways: "The Senate has
gone beyond its jurisdiction."
Of course. the honourable gentleman who
leads this House so cleverly saw the danger
of having one House pitted against the other
on the principle unanimously affirmed by
this House in May, 1918; and, with a skill
that I admire, he comes to us and says:
"Gentlemen, let us accept this message, but
sta,te that we do net agree with the principle
therein contained." Therefore we are invited

-

JUNE 24, 1925
hy the honourable leader of the House ta
repel the attack on the principle involving
our jurisdiction. Every one af us is satisfied
that the Senate has been acting within the
ambit of its attributions.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: Not ail.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Well, let us say
the enormous mrajority of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: That is right.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Well, if that is the
case, what remains in the resolution? Nothing
at ail. Let honouraible gentlemen take it
paragrapli by pamagraph, and if at tlhe end
af eacli paragraphl they eay, "The Senate
acted within its juriscliction," that paragrapli
must go by the 'board. Finally nothing is
lef t at ail of Vhis documenit; and yet ft is
that "nothingness" that we are now asked
ta accept. I say that we -cannat accept this
message witihout actually a.bandoning the
position we took as ta, the prerogatives of the
Senate. Every word of it is a condemnation
of our conduct, and therefore every word of
it must be repeiled.
But there is something more. If we accept
the message besides limiting aur jurisdiction,
we are in addition going to create a very
dangerous precedenit, notwithstanding the
reservation that the honourable leader af the
House skilfully proposes ta, interject therein.
Now, following the remarks of the honouirable senior memlber for OttVawa (Hon. Mr.
Belcourt) on that point, the W'hole theory
built up by the (Government as a base for
the original Bill is that Sir Thomas White
voluntarily did sometihing, or amitted, something resulting in the sacrifice of the depositors of the Bank, but which was intended ta
and did preserve the aredit af the country.
If that bie true, there is ground for the moral
obligation alleged; but if that is flot true,
t'here is no suoli ground at ail. In the presentý
instance the deduction from the evidëm~e is
somewliat, as follows: if Sir Thomas had made
an outside investigation of the affairs of the
Bank it would have caused a run on the
Bank, and endangered the credit of the
country. That was the only avenue open to
him ta preserve the riglits of the depositors.
But that door lie refused ta open, fiar fear
that panic would corne in through it and
endanger the credit of the country. I say
there is nothing in the record Vo establish
such a contention.
Honourable gentlemen know how niany
banks have been absox'bed, by other banks, ta
the ut-ter amazement even af the people who
were interested in those banks as shareholders.
You take up your paper some day and find

that a large bank has absaxibed a smaller one;
but do you imagine such abisorptian hais been
aarried out in a night? Not at alI. The
officers, af the larger bank 'have had their
employees in the smaller bank for monthq;
the Bankers' Association has very aiten had
its representative for weeks and weeks eQialnining the books of the smaller bank.
Was that process clased ta Sir Thomas
White? Not at ail. Therefore, if my honoura-ie iriends opposite are riglit, Sir Thonmas
voluntarily repudiated suali easy mea.neso8
ready at his hand, by which an investigation cou-Id have been made by himseif or
his officers or by the Bankers' Association
and their officers, and which wauýld have
resulted lin pratecting ail tihe deposi'tars.
Must we came ta that conclusion? Io there
anything in the record ta demonstrate that?
Nat one tittile af truth. W-hat there is in the
record is plain: that gentleman, had -a discretion and he honestly and blamelessly
exercised that discretian as far as he could
s-t the time, with foresiglit, experience, and
undotxbtedly with integrîty.
Are we going ta affirm now that, if similar
circumstance arise in future. the people af
Canada are to be hel-d hiable, and, that they
will have 'ta pay? If you lay clown that
principle, yau leave it ta be applied ta every
case where discretion is lawful-ly and blameiessly exercised. Sir Thomas had some discretion, and tlhe only thing lie could do was
ta use it honestly and with the light that God
had given him. If by sa daing he lias bound
the people of Canada, then in like manner
thev can 'be bound by the decision, honest but
faulty, ai any tribunal in the land. When
that judgment will finally ibe @et right by aur
Courts of last resort, then the litigants under
that principle may say: "lHis discretion was
used honestly, but not wisely, and I have
suffered damnages, as the depositors ai the
Home Bank did-because Sir Thomas White
exercised honestly but unwisely the discretian
that the law gave him."l There, is no distinction between the twa. If ail the judges in
the land can bind us bY the exes'cise oi their
discretion, sad if ail tihe officers and representatives ai Canada, acting within -the
bounds ai the discretion which the iaw gives
theni, can bind the people af Canada, then,
inotead ai facîng a calamity which now and
then may visit. the land, we will have Vo, face
thausando af cases of responsiibility w-hich
would he' in constant creation against thie
people ai Canada day and niglit.
I say we cannat accept, this resulution, for
Vwo reasons: first, bs-cause if we accept it we
admit that we have gone beyond aur juris
diction; seconýdly, if we consent that the Bill

î

670

SENATE

be passed as it first came before us, we cannot but subscribe to the dangerous principle
that the people of Canada, can be held responsible for damages flowing from the
bla'meless exercise by any one in authority
of discretionary powers creaited by law.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
My distinguished friend the senior member for
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) reinforced today the argument he had made before, which
astonihed me because of hie distinction at
the Bar. In speaking before, at page 585 of
the Debates. he used this language:
But I repeat that if it were a matter between subject and subject, there is absolutely no doubt that
there would be a good, substantial claim in the courts
on the part of the losers.

He argued that, whereby in a claim against
the Government, no action can be brought
except with its permission, a claimant in
other cases can take action in the civil courts.
As a lawyer, I do not think so.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes, on the ground
of estoppel. I stick to my proposition.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I assume my
honourable friend does, because lie has used
the same language in another argument today. A claim between private litigants that
could be broulght on the ground of estoppel,
which is simply one of the phases of equity
jurisdiction, would be a claim that could be
brought of right, not of grace. A claim of
estoppel, if put on the grounds of equity, an
equity estoppel, is an absolute right that you
can raise in a court on the adjudication, and
sustain your right.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is a very close
point. Subjects are able to exercise, as against
subjects, claims based on estoppel on equitable grounds, where a subject could not urge
the same ground as against the Crown. For
instance, take a case of tort, a case of damages
caused by a state railway through negligence,
etc.: it has only been quite lately that a
subject could claim against the Crown for
that. I remember cases against the Intercolonial Railway, under which the Crown was
not liable, though a subject would have
been liable under exactly the same conditions.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
the law at the present time.

But that is not

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is the law in
regard to many things for which a remedy
has not been created.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: There is only
one logical application of the honourable
gentleman's argument. First, he says that
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

the claim could not be maintained against
the Government. I suppose he means without
a fiat.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No, I mean that
there would be no legal ground. A remedy
against the Crown would have to be created
under conditions of that sort before a claim
could be brought against the Crown.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I submit, again,
that under recent decisions, if a depositor
could have gone into a civil court and recovered against the Home Bank in consequence of misconduct or anything else in
the administration of its affairs, on a legal
or an equitable claim, he could have gone
into the courts against the Government by
fiat and if so, there is no object 'in putting
it on any other ground than that of grace.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: There is to-day
no legal remedy afforded the subject on
which he could apply for a fiat in this case.
If he did apply for a fiat by petition of
right, he would be told that there was no
remedy, and that he could not recover against
the Crown. That does not apply only to this
case; I could cite to my honourable friend
dozens of cases where no remedy exists against
the Crown, though there is a remedy as between subject and subject. The principle
or doctrine which underlies the rule is that
the king could do no wrong, and this applies
not to Great Britain only. but to the republic
to the south of us, for instance. The state
can do no wrong; hence no action would lie
against the state for a wrong unless the state
chose to create the remedy.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:

That is, tort?

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes. I say there
is no legal way by which these depositors
could press a claim against the state on legal
grounds.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Before the right
honourable gentleman (Right Hon. Sir George
E. Foster) takes the floor, I would like to
draw his attention to a special feature of our
amendments whieh may cause considerable distress on the part of some of the depositors.
It is in clause a of the first section:
The persons entitled to payment of aid under this
A<t shall be such of the creditors referred to in sectons 2 and 3 of this Act as are found by the Commissioner hereinafter appointed to be in special need by
rcason of the suspension of the Bank.

That seems not to cover many cases of
people who have accumulated some savings
in the Bank-people who are not in absolute
need at present, but who know that they will
need that money in future. If this feature of

JtJNE 24, 1925

a letter
which. is

becomes law, perbaps a considerable
of deserving cases wil1 ha barred. I
this because I arn just in receipt of
from Coal Creek, British Columbia,
as £ollows:

I arn enclosing the report of the Senate on the Home
Bankc Bill which appeared in the Calgary Herald. But
surely there muet be some mistake. 1 amna ýdepositor,

everv economy in order to save to educate my family
and have something to live on in case of siekuess;
ani the way the Bill reads, we would get nothing after
ail our sacrifice and hardahips. Now, would that be
fair? If the Government hast closed. the bank in 1916
or 1918 I wouldn't have hast a cent in it, as I had
some small amnounts that I had transferred to the
Hume Bank.
Hoping that you will use this as an open letter to
the Senate, as au appeal to thema for justice,
Mre. Mary Forsythe.

I mention this case to indicate that if a
rule is made that absolute or actual need must
be shown. a, great number of deserving people,
such as this woman, wil1 be debarred.
Hon. Mr. TIJRRllFF: Honourable gentleman, when this Bill was brought into -the
Senate I stated that I was in favour of paying
something to the depositors. As the debate
went on and I heard some of the arguments
advanced by my honourable friends opposite,
the proposition adopted. by this Hanuse, by
which the aniali depositors would ha helpedand those were the ones I was thinking ofappealed to me more than the original Bill.
I arn very anxious that the small depositors
who have been led to believe that they are
going to get something now, when thcy need
it, should flot be disappointed. I fear, however, from 'the way things are going, that wc
may get intu some sort of a political, or
more Ekeiy a constitutional, fight, and that it
may not be possible this session to grant ta
those srnall depositurs what it was proposed to
give them.
I think the Goverument could accomplish
its obj eut and at the same time help aut
the small depositors. Let the Goverument
ac'cept the Bill as it is now, and pay the
35 per cent to all depositors of less than
$50, and then proceed to deal1 with the others
belore a Commissioner. If the Government
is not thexu satisfied tihat Canada lias dsmne
enough for the lasers, let it bring in another
Bill next year. Nobody would suifer vcry
m'uch by such action. It seexus to me that
t
it wou:ld be better to do that than o enter
fight between the House
into a constitutional.
of Comxnons and the Sénate.
If tihat suggestion cannot be f ull-owed, I
would ask my fellow memnbers of Parliament,

671

in the Senate and in the Huse of G;om-mons.
to be as moderate as possible, and to try to
meet on some common ground in order to
help the smail depositors and net shut thani
out. To zny mind it would be littie short
of a crime to f ail at this time to give aid
to the depositors, when we ail want to assist.
I hope that nothing will happen te, prevent
us doing something for thoee who nu doubt
are greatly in need of the xnoney. If the
Government does flot see its way clear to
do that, let it put an item in the Estiniates,
and then this House cannet stop it. If something of that kind is not doue, it will look
very much to me as though the Government
were trying to make use of this question to
get votes at the next election. We do not
want ùhat. This is teo sacred a matter to
be treated in that way. I have myself faced
a good many eleetions, and, knowing that we
are alI very human, I can uuderstand tlie
ternptation. But I would not like to sec this
question of helpiug out hundreds of pour
peuple made use of to gain a few votes,
because it would be done at the expeuse of
peuple who have lost pradtically their all in
the failure ef the Home Bank.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: Honourable gentlemen, I think I should state the reasons
which justify the vote that I arn about to
give. I agre-e in princtipýle with the amnendments that the Seniate bas passed. Those
amendments are very judicious, and I believe
that the country at large appruves of them;
but I believe also that we had nu right to
make them,. I believe that what we have
dune is tu amend a Money Bill, and to amend
it as much as it enu be amended. The Bill
bas been abtered in many ways, and in my
bebief we have nu rigbt to amend it in anY
way.
I do nut intend ta discuss the reasuns why
I hold the opinion that we have gone bevond
our jnrisdictiun in this matter. The question
of our puwers in that regard was sifted most
thoroughby -in this bouse some 15 years ago.
I will not repeat any of the arguments that
were presented then; but wibl resuane my seat
after saying that I am sorry I cannot fobbow
honourable gentlemen on this side of the
bouse in this matter, and that, although we
have dune a meritorious action, I do nut
think we hâd. the right or the power to do it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable gentlemen, inasmuch as th>is question bas become
somewhat involved, due to the motion, now
before thse House, as an ardent supporter of
the original Bill I feel disposed to say a
word in erder that I rniy not be inisunderstood.

672

SENATE

My honourable friend the Leader of the
Government brought into this House a Bill
the purport of which and the title of which
woul'd indicate that it was intended, as it was
announced to be, for the relief of the Home
Bank depositors. This House to some extent
modified that Bill; but surely the Bill that
went back to the House of Commons was
designed to bring relief to Home Bank
depositors, and in that sense the principle was
in no way changed.
As my honourable friend the Leader on
this side of the House said this morning, if
it were a matter of right and not a matter of
relief, there would be no question of 35 per
cent or 100 per cent. If it were a matter of
right, it would certainly fall in the latter
class.
My honourable friend the Leader of the
Government now comes back to us with a
Message from the other House, and proposes
the adoption of the suggestion contained in
that Message, and moves that this House do
not insist upon the decision it arrived at the
other day. I was one of those who at first
was opposed to the decision reached the other
day, but finally I accepted that decision,
honestly believing it to be the best that could
be obtained in the way of bringing relief to
Home Bank depositors; and because I still
believe it to be the best that can be obtained,
I intend to oppose the motion of my honourable friend.
I bel:ieve the adoption of
that motion would only further complicate
the situation.
It has been stated that this House has no right
to amend a Money Bill, and that right is
questioned under several heads in the Message
received from the Commons. May I call the
attention of the House to the fact that only
yesterday my honourable friend the Leader
of the Government in this House made a proposal before a Committee of this House to
reduce the amount named in the SunnybraeGuysborough Railway Bill from $3,350,000 to
$2,225,000; and when that proposal did not carry,
te made a further suggestion. I mention that
simply to draw his attention to the fact that
not so very long ago he was of the opinion that
it was proper for this House to amend a
Money Bill.
I understand him to say today that he still holds the same view. In
that view I agree with him; but I cannot
agree that it would be in keeping with the
proper dignity of this House to accept the
motion at present before the House, which,
in effect, would be an acknowledgment of the
principle that this House had exceeded
constitutional rights.
Hon.

Mr.

ROBERTSON.

its

Hon. Mr. DANDUR\AND:
Although I
disclaim it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That element
has been injected into the situation by the
Government very possibly with a view of so
involving the whole matter that the Bill
itself may fail, and that the Senate may be
held responsible for its failure.
Therefore,
I propose, so far as I am able, to make the

issue clear and well-defined, so that there may

be no misunderstanding.
The Government
might in the first place have included the
amount that it proposed to grant for relief in
the Estimates, and it would have been passed
without a word. However, it did not pursue
that course, but brought down a Bill. This

House in its wisdom ,decided that a certain
amount of assistance should be granted to
those who seemed to be most in need, and,
as we differed in opinion, and as it seemed
clear that the Bill as brought down could not
prevail, a compromise was made, which I
believe to be the best that could be obtained

under the circumstances.
I now propose to
stand by that compromise, st'l believing
Lt to be the best that can ultimately be
obtained for the Home Bank depositors, much
as I would like to sec them get ail that was
provided for in the original Bill.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER:
Honourable gentlemen, I do not propose to

traverse the ground that was so well explored in the preceding debate. There are
just one or two things that I wish to say. I
met a man who was very strongly in favour of
having the Home Bank claims fulfilled to the
letter. His argument was this: "Did not the
Finance Minister, Sir Thomas White, at that
time say again and again, and did lie not
repeat in his evidence, that under ail the
circumstances he felt it was his duty as Finance
Minister to stand behind the banks and not
allow a financial crash while the war was on?"
I said, "Yes, you are perfectly right in that."
"Very well, then," this man said, "where is
your argument against coming to the relief
of people who suffered losses through the
Bank?"
That, I think, illustrates a confusion of ideas that we might easily lapse
into.
When Sir Thomas White or any other
Finance Minister says under circumstances of
special stress, "I am not going to let the
financial fabric go to pieces, I am going to
stand behind the banks," lie makes no pledge
that he will make good ail the losses that
accrue to the people in the country because
of their transactions with the banks.
I think there is a very palpable distinction
which has been lost sight of in a great many
cases. There is a silver, or golden, or steel

JUNE 24, 1925
thread that runs through all the operations
of Goverilmen-ts. They do the best they can to
establish foundations of security; tliey do it
by means of legisiation, judges and law courts;
they do it by means of police and standing
armies and militia. The Government of a
country passes ail these measures and puts in
motion ail this rnachinery in order that peace
and order may be maintained, so ýthat when
I arn walking ialong the streets of my city 1
shail fot be set upon and maltreated, and Sa
that I shall fot have my home entered and my
gonds taken from me. But that is ail that a.
Government can properly do, unless you adopt
ultra socialisrn and nationalignm. If a man
burglarizes my home, in spite of the fact thýat
the Government lias practically given me a
pledge that law and order shail be maintained
in this country, and life and property secured,
I cannot corne on the Governrnent; and no
Government that ever was would corne ta my
relief aad pay me for the gonds stolen out of
my house. Or, if I were maltreated and murdered un the street, the Government would
flot iegally or morally or equitably be bound
to recompense rny family for the loss it sustained by reason of my being blotted out of
existence. That thread runs through the wliole
of modemn government, and that is as f ar as
governrnents can go unless we becorne coinpletely communistie and socialistic.
The samne principle runs through our banking
operations, the granting of letters patent, and
nurnerous other institutions, which the ýGovernment tries to, iake as saf e as possible. But
if, in spite of ail these precautions, someone breaks loose and some harmi is done, it
neyer goesý to the extent of saying: "You can
corne to us; we hava an open purse and will
give you relief, and will caîl upon everynne
in the cornmunity to -contribute hisare.
That is the ground upon 'which I stand.
Hon. Mr. BFJjOURT: If for the purpose
of the war the ýGovernment needed my bouse
or rny chattels, and came and took themn or
used them and caused considerable damage to
them, woild. there pot ha at least an equitable
dlaim against the Government for compensation?
Riglit lion. Sir 'GEORGE E. FOSTER:
There would lie no dlaim or dispute about
it at aIl. If the Government wants to bud
a railway it can go through your property and
take it and pay you what it considers right.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But that is regulated by statute.
There is provision by
statute for that sort of thing.
Riglit Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
But it is quite different frorn the general
S-48

673

argument 'that I have been working out.
Surely my honourable friend does flot mean
that as an argument. As a question it bas,
its an.swer, and I give it the answer.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I think the propositionRight Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I cannot now discuas the question, pro and
con, witb my hýonourable friend. He is as
full of questions as an egg is full of meat,
and they corne out equally at the rnost
opportune and most inopportune timýes.
Where was I when I was plied witli this
,question? I think I was on, the general
principle that what a Government does do,
and what it is bound ta do, is to take every
proper care. Wben it fails in the objeet of
Government in any of these respects, then
the person wbo has been protected ta the
utmost has ta pay lis own shot in the lasses
whicb occur.
My bonourable friand ta my right (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) says that lie supported the
amended Bill fram a certain standpoin.t. I
supported it frorn an entirely different standpoint. To-day lie takes the stand that we
ought ta iosist upan the measure that we
passed. Whilst I arn out of sympatby with
ail the reasons upon which this relief is asked
and lias been measurably granted, and whilst
unable to carry my views in this House ta
the extent ta whicb I would have liked to
carry them, I stand by the common conclusion at whicli we arrived, and I wili support the measure which we adopted.
I have a little grudge against my hanourable friend wlio leads the Government bere.
He lias lad me and the rest of us into a certain position. Now lie cornes back and whips
us because we tank the position that he
urged and persuadad us ta take. Wlien we

a member of the Government and asks us to
retreat while they pepper us with shot. I
think my honourable friend was ungracious to
lead us into a trap of that kind. I just remind him of this. We will forgive him this
time, but if he ever does it again we shall
have some hard words to say about him.
My honourable friend from Assiniboia
(Hon. Mr. Turriff) comes out on sensible
lines once in a while, Progressive though he
is. He came out this afternoon on what I
think is a very sensible line. In order to
gain his heart's desire, his correct course is
plainly to insist on what we have donc. That
will be so much gained, anyway. If he does
not do that, he stands te lose what he wishes
for in this respect.
These were a few things I desired to say.
I wish to make it plain that in my opinion,
with due regard to the history of government and to what may follow from the precedents we set we can stand on no firm ground
but that which I indicated in the remarks I
made last Wednesday in this Chiamber.
My honourable friend has cited one instance
and invited my attention to it. What is that
instance? It is the case, not of a person in
actual need, but a person who through years
of saving put by, over and above present
requirements, something for a rainy day. She
placed it where it was supposed to be safe, and
it is in jeopardy. She has other means, which
make it problematical that she can base her
claim on actual need. That instance appeals
to our sympathy, but, after all, there are
other cases which would appeal just as
strongly. You may lay by a few thousand
dollars for a rainy day. On the other hand,
you may bring up a family with care and
tenderness, and when they have reached the
age at which they are capable of earning
money they may be drafted into military
service and their assistance be taken from
you for years, perhaps forever. They have
been a much more valuable asset to you than
would be a few thousand dollars saved up and
deposited in a bank, but you cannot come
to this Government and ask it through sympathy to pay you for your loss. That kind
of loss is distributed ail over our country, and
that is the reason why I say that if you put
the claim for compensation on the ground
that the loss was due to the war, it is a
pretty wide ground. I do not know at what
goal you would ultimately arrive if you
travelled along that road. Whatever we do,
we shall find cases which appear extreme,
but this case is net that of the greatest hardship that I could imagine.
Hon.

Mr. BELCOURT.

Hon. *Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, I would like to clear myself of the
implied accusation of insincerity.
I want
to remind my honourable friends that when I
suggested that we should pass the second
reading without binding ourselves to the
principle of the Bill. it was in order that on
the next day we might hear the Liquidator
and ascertain how much truth there was in
the claim that possibly we were paying money
to a large number of well-to-do people. We
met in Committee informally-for the Bill
was net referred to that Committee-for the
purpose of hearing the Liquidator, and after
an hour or two of explanation from him we
found that as a matter of fact 47,000 claimants
out of 53,000 had claims below $500, and that
the Home Bank was hardly a commercial
institution, as it did not lend money, but
simply received deposits and threw them into
sinkholes. In order to clear myself of any
responsibility for the preparation of these
amendments, may I remind my right honourable friend that the Banking and Commerce
Committee decided to appoint from among
its members, or from among the members of
the Senate, a small sub-committee to confer
informally-for it had no mandate-and to
study the proposed amendments. Although
my name was in the list of members of that
sub-committee, I stated that, inasmuch as I
had in hand a Bill whicl I had been commissioned to submit, explain and defend in
the Senate, it would not be proper for me to
act on that sub-committee. My right honourable friend will therefore realize, if I may
now refresh bis memory, that I simply led
him and many other colleagues into a conference with the Liquidator so that we might
obtain all possible light on the matter.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Which, being interpreted. means that my honourable friend led his valiant troops up to
the front and into the firing line, and then
deserted to the enemy leaving them to take
the consequences.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I met the troops
again here, and I pointed out, just as the Bill
was about to come from Committee, that it
was at variance with the principle of the
measure that I had been defending. I stated
that I did net know how the Government or
the House of Commons would receive it.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I think you are in for that.

sorry to sec the same developm.ents in this

year appealing for restrictions, and these have
been thrown around this evil. so as to dete
the youth of our country from cultivating the
habit.
In many cases, legisiatures have passed
restrictions to the extent of their powers, and
in the House of Commons ýthis BillHl received
almost unanýimous assent after having been
very thoroughly diseussed. To me it seems
somewhat drastic for us to step in now and
oblitoerate what might be cailled preparatory
sentiment, which I believe is strong in the
country, and which has demonstrated its
strength by the legislation which has already
passed the ether House.
I think there should be some very strong
:easons why we should throw out the considered conclusion of the other House, which
gave much more serious and lengthened examination to this matter than we have done.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gentlemen, it is not for me to give the reasons which actuated the Committee in rejecting this amendment. I confess that I did net
have the help of the eloquence of my right
honourable friend to support me in the Committee, but I regard this matter of sufficient
importance to test the general feeling of the
Senate, and I therefore move:
That this amendment of the Committee be not concurred in.

The Clause in the Bill as it came to us
prohibits the publication of:
information intended to assist in, or intended
-any
for use in connection with, book-making, pool-selling,
betting or wagering upon any horse race or other race,
fight, garne or sport, whether at the time of advertismg, printing, publishing, exhibiting, posting up or
supplying such news or information, such horse race
or other race, fight, game or sport has or has not
taken place; or,

The present Act prohibits importation, but
this prohibition has not proven effective, and
the Commons sent to us an amendment which
pirohibits publication altogether, and thus
covers net only the publication in our Canadian press, but naturally in all foreign newspapers, either with intent or not. This is a
very clear advance, as I believe, upon the
legislation we have on the Statute Book.
The present statute prohibits publication with
intent, and prohibits importation of news,
but this amendment prohibits publication altogether, either with intent or not.
My right honourable friend (Right Hon.
Sir George E. Foster) said that the habit of
betting had perhaps not permeated our popuHon. Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

barber shops, everywhere, and offering his
bets te all the people he can meet in place:
where men congregate. These bets are made
on entries and selections which appear in the
press, and it is upon those entries and selections that he asks people to bet, and of
course the bets are settled on the results as
published.
The Committee was opposed to this legislation because it was claimed that it could
not be applied; that the people could get
such information phrough the radio, the telepbone and the t .legraph wires. The Committee also felt that we could net prevent
the press of the United States, Great Britain,
and other countries from reaching our shores

that I was alone in the Committee in stand-

ing by that clause.
I still believe that there is some advantage
in trying to prevent the extension of that
human frailty, the habit of betting, or winning
by chance. In order to induce my coileagues
in the Committee to accept this legislation, I
declared that I was ready to vote for this
amendment which was suggested by a member:
Nothing in this section shall prevent a newspaper
from ful¯y reporting a horse race or other sporting event
on the day such event takes place or on the next following legal day.

That is, we retained the prohibition of

made no headway. Here I am in the Senate.
and with the help of my honourable friend I
hope I may reverse the decision of the Committee.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My honourable friend would leave the impression
that there was a strong betting comrnmunity
among the members constituting the Committee on the Criminal Code, and that in
order to support their favourite pastime they
struck out this clause; but my honourable
friend knows that the evidence before the
Committee showed that it was practically
impossible to enforce this law. It meant
that we would have to suppress the information in the Canadian press. Well, the
Canadian press might possibly bow obediently to the mandate of the law, and suppress the information; but what about the

JUNE 24, 1925
foreign press coming into Canada-the English papers, the American papers, the French
papers; all the foreign papers that come into
the Dominion and are disseminated as widely
almost as our own press? Is it not manifest
that it would be impossible for the Government to suppress the information appearing
in the foreign press touching this subject? It
was said before the Committee that these
papers wouid have to prepare a special expurgated edition for dissemination in Canada,
so that our morally superior minds might
not be contaminated by the information which
they generally publish and disseminate among
other people. That, of course, is a very high
ground to take; it is an i.deal condition of
mind which, by and by, after a lot of legislation, our people may reach. But up to the
present time we have not been able to satisfy
ourselves that we are very much better than
other people, and that special editions of the
foreign press should be published for consumption by the Canadian people.
Why place upon the Statute Book legislation that cannot be enforced? There seems
to be an opinion amongst certain portions of
our public to-day-and it is disseminated by
a certain school of morality-that if there is
anything wrong in the moral tone of the
people, all that has to be donc to rectify it
is to place legislation upon the Statute Book.
This is an attempt in that particular direction.
But you cannot make people moral by legislation. It was admitted before the Committee
that the present law is not enforced. There
is no attempt practically to enforce the present
tatute: and if the present statute is not
enforced. how in the world can we hope to
enforce legislation touching the foreign press?
Such a thing would mean all kinds of interrational complications. It seems to me that
we should exercise common sense in regard
to legislation of this kind. There is just as
strong a moral sentiment on the part of
those who are opposed to this legislation as
there is on the part of those who are promoting it, and it is just as well, honourable
gentlemen, not to be hypocritical, but to
express ourselves plainly on this subject.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I have every sympathy with the idea of
slating the hypocrites. Slate them; slate them
every time; slate yourself if you are a hypocrite; but I do not like the insinuation conveyed in the statement that this kind of
legislation was supposed to seize only moral
and superior minds. This legislation is not
asked for by people who make any assumption of being the superior and only correct

moralists in the country, and I do not think
my honourable friend meant it in that way.
No, I
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:

LOUGHEED:

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I am quite agreed with my honourable friend
on that; but I am absolutely of the opinion
that you must follow the trend of public
sentiment, and that legislators willy nilly are
in duty bound to follow it as far as there
is a chance of comparative success in carrying
it out.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Will my
honourable friend allow me to put him a
question? How will it be possible for the
Government of Canada to exclude the foreign
press which, as my honourable friend knows,
has a very large circulation in Canada? And
why should the foreign press, if it cannot be
suppressed as to this information, be placed
on a better plane than the press of Canada?
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Argument along that line is fallible, I think'

Bill, I suppose, originated with and has the

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No. It

Attorney General of Ontario.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Well, suppose it did. It could never get here
unless the Department of Justice took it up.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: All those amendments come through the channel of the
Department of Justice.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Surely we have not a Minister of Justice
who simply lets a thing go through because
somebody outside who has a particular fad
wants to have it done. Surely, in a responsible, modern Government we have the
Justice Department behind every bit of legislation referring to our Code which it is
attempted to put on our Statute Book. Then,
I read what Mr. Edwards said, who, I think
answered very well the questions that were
put to him; and what be said led me to believe that it would be possible to make use of
this law to advantage. There is a difficulty
with regard to foreign papers; but I wonder
if it is impossible for the United States papers,
which, I suppose, are the main ones that
come inHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, the
English papers. The Times publishes this
information.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I wonder whether it is not possible for those
papers to put out an expurgated edition? It
certainly is possible. Is it practicabre? The
dissemination of this information is against
the law of the country, and the law of the
country must be operative. We have post
office regulations and laws which actually
prohibit a certain class of papers. These papers,
we know, do come in surreptitiosly; but I
do not think we could take the ground that
because we cannot suppress them entirely,
and because they come in, wa ought not to
have laws against them. The question is
whether we cannot go a little further than
we do now. I do not want to appear extreme,
and I do net think I am; but as a legislator
I want to keep fairly even with the public
sentiment that is abroad.
Honourable
lon. Mir. DANDURAND:
gentlemen, there is a certain sentiment in
various places in the country in favour of this
legislation, and I think we ow-e it to ourselves to express an opinion on the matter
and to show where we stand. If the Senate
disapproves of this legislation by a very large
majority, such as that which appeaired in the
Committee, the public should know it. and
we should not everv year be receivinc from
the Commons legislation which the Senate
will not entertain.
Hon.

Sir JAMES

LOUGHEED.

Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen,
I just wish to make a few very brief remarks
about this matter. I' think it is about time that
we ceased paying -any attention at all to the
opinion of the Department of Justice. I have
the greiatest respect for the personnel of that
Department. It is composed of able and
trained men, but ýit is a political institution,
and you cannot make it otherwise. It is exactly the same with our Department of Justice
as it was with the law officers of the Crown
when Lord Palmerston once complained to
one of .them saying, "That opinion of yours
caused me a great deal of trouble." "Well,"
was the re<ply, "you did not tel! me what kind
of opinion you wanted." Now I drop that out
altogether.
The proposition is submitted that we should
follow public sentiment. I challenge that proposition in toto. Public sentiment may be
one way to-day and another way to-morrow
This House, which is asserting the rights that
bellong to it as the supreme court of this country, the final court of appeal in, practically
everything, has to find out the principle on
which to act, and to keep steadily to that and
to guide public sentiment.
Now, when you corme doxn to particulars.

which I think is utterly nonsensical. For that
re ason I am satisfied that the action of the
Committee on this Bill was right. You are
not enforcing the law ihat you now have, and
you are adding stili another. There is no
good cluttering up the Statute Book with
things you don't enforce.

act of cruelty: a man beats an animal
wantonly. I do rot know whether that provision ought to be in the statute or net.
But how far are you going with your amendment? Yen compel a man te keep in mind
Hon. Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

the duty of providing during his absence
for any living thing he may have in his
house, even the flees. Where are you going
te stop? An animal is an animal.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL:
If you go
aiway and leave a horse in a stable for two
days without food or water, does that net
constitute gross cruelty?
My honourable
friend from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. McMeans)
speaks of the Royal Humane Society and the
excellent work they do. Well, if there is
no law stating specifically where the cruelty
is, they cannot carry out their duty properly,
as they are trying all the time to do.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: If my honourable
friend will allow me, I will try to draw a
distinction. A man who leaves his horse
without food or water and allows it te die
is punishing himself, in the first place, because he loses his own animal; and if he
could be guilty of that sort of thing te might
commit cruelty. But is net that a remote
case?
How aan you conceive of a man
doing that? You can conceive of a man in
anger beating bis horse wantonly or cruelly,
but it is hard to think of a man with rage
in his heart locking the stable and going
away, declaring he wili be avenged on his
torse by leaving it for four or five days
without food or drink until it dies. That is
the sort of idea that people have in mind
when they rack their brains for a new law
that is to bind us all through life If yo
forget about your canary and it dies, you
must go te prison.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Or pay a fine.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Or pay a fine. Ycu
are a criminal. If you have performing
mice and forget about thern, you must go to
prison. There ought to be a limit to that
sort of legislation, and it seems te me that
t is time to draw the line.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would point
out to my honourable friend that the words
"wantonly, cruel]y or unnecessarily" govern
the whole cction.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Is not that the law
already? I know that down where I live,
if a man drives a horse that is galled in the
shoulder, the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals immacdiately looks after
that case and the man is punished.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, the law is
already on the Statute Book. It is te that
very clause lie propoced amendment is
added.

JUNE 24, 1925
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Is not the present
law sufficient for a case of that kind?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No. It does
not cover abandonment in distress.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Of course it would.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Will my honourable friend look at the word "ill-treats"?
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: If it is cruel to drive
a horse with a sore shoulder, surely it is
cruelty to leave a horse in a barn or stable
without food or water.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The first part
of the amendment covers an action; the
second part covers inaction. I move the
adoption of this amendment.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: My honourable
friend from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien)
cannot conceive of any man leaving a horse
for several days without food or water. During
the past winter, a farmer living several miles
out of Ottawa went away from his farm and
left several head of cattle. He was away
five or six days, and it was only by the
bawling of these cattle, from starvation, that
the neighbours knew he was away. Some of
the cattle were almost at the point of death
from starvation. If an amendment is necessary
to cover cases of that kind, it ought to pass.
The amendment was agreed to.

The preamble and the title were agreed to.
The Bill was reported as amended.

PRIVATE BILL
CONCURRENCE IN REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. G. G. FOSTER moved concurrence
in the report of the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce on Bill 11, an Act
to incorporate Dominion Chartered Customs
House Brokers Association.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, the Conmittee recommend that consideriation of this
Bill be postponed, in order that information
may be given which was not before the
Committee when we dealt with the matter
this morning. The Committee think that the
promoters should let this Bill stand till
another Session.
The motion was agreed to.
GRAIN BILL
CONCURRENCE IN REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. ROBERT WATSON moved concurrence in the report of the Special Committee to whom was referred Bill 113, an Act
respecting Grain.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the Committee sat until midnight yesterday considering this Bill, and we had the advantage of
having with us the Board, the experts, and
interested parties. The proposed changes are
very slight. As a matter of fact, there is
only one that is of any particular importance.
It is in paragraph b of subsection 1 of section
140, and is to this effect. The Bill as it came
before us read:
All grain inspected out of of a private elevator shall
be required, in order to receive a grade, to be equal to
the generail average quality of the grade of a similar
grade passing inspection at the initial official inspection point, and shall be properly cleaned.

The Committee recommend that that be
changed b reinstating the following clause
that passed the Agricultural Committee of
the House of Commons:
All grain inspected out of a private elevator shall be
required in order to receive a grade to be equal in
quality to a similar grade passing inspection from the
general bins of a public terminal elevator.

So the grades would require to be equal to
the public terminal elevator grades in order
to get a certificate. The paragraph as il come
to us from the House of Commons provided
for equality with the grade passing inspection
at the initial official inspection point. Now,
all grain is inspected at Winnipeg. The terminals referred to particularly are at Fort
William and Port Arthur. Between Winnipeg
and Port Arthur millers and others have an
opportunity of buying carloads of wheat, and
they naturally skin the grades more or less,
because they take the best quality. It is
not fair to ask an elevator that has to take
in the residue to give the same grades as at
Winnipeg. The terminal elev'ator at present
has to give the same grade that is given in
the public elevators. The other changes are
simply the correction of a clerical error and
the notification regarding the distribution of
cars.
The motion was agreed to.

THIRD READING

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.
HOME BANK DEPOSITORS RELIEF
BILL
PROPOSED CONFERENCE WITH HOUSE OF
COMMONS

The Hon. the SPEAKER presented the following message from the House of Commons:
Resolved, that a Message be sent to the Senate
respectfuly requesting a Free Conference with Their
Honours to consider certain amendments made by the
Senate to the Bill No. 182, an Act for the Relief of
the Depositors of the Home Bank of Canada, to
which amendments this House has not agreed and
upon which the Senate insist, and any amendment
which at such Conference it may be considered desirable to make to said Bill or amendments thereto.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen. according to practice and logic,
the members of the Chamber whose policy
has been maintained, in contradistirction to
that of the other House, must move to appoint
the Managers to the Conference from among
those who have insisted upon the amendments. That being so, I leave it to my honourable friend to move.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
As my
honourable friend is the Leader of the Government in this House, and is in charge of
the Bill, it seems to me that he should move
for tho Conference. I shall then move to
nominate certain gentlemen on this side to
represent the views entertained on this side
of the House.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have not the
complete formula, but I move that we agree
to a Conference, and I would suggest that we
appoint from three to five managers.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
suggest to my honourable friend that the
Right Honourable Sir George Foster, the
Honourable George G. Foster, of Alma, and
the Honourable Mr. Black, of Westmoreland,
should represent this side of the House. It
seems to me that my honourable friend should
nominate the Honourable Mr. Béique, who
took a very active part in drafting the Bill
as it went from this House.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Honourable Mr. Béique is not here.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: He will
be here.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And I believe
that the Senate has sufficient confidence in the
honourable gentlemen whom my honourable
friend hns named to leave the interests of the
Hon.

Mr. WATSON.

Senate in their hands, with himself as the
fourth representative.
I believe that those
four would fairly repretsent the opinion of
the Senate.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The only
answer I have to that is that this Bill was
very largely the unanimous production of the
Senate. Both siýdes agreed upon it. It is
very undesirable that any impression should
be created either in the mind of the Commons or in the mind of the public that this
side alone is responsible for the Bill. I think
my honourable friend should appoint one or
more representatives from hais own side of
the House; otherwise I would not feel that
we were justified in going into a Conference
on a Bill of this nature.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have no ob.jection to the addition of a fifth representative; but there is a certain misconception as
to the attitude of a certain number of the
members of this Chamber. We went into this
matter yesterday although not very deeply,
and my right honourable friend (Right Hon.
Sir George E. Foster) referred to my suggestion that we were not binding the Senate
to the principle contained in the Bill-that
we passed the second reading and looked for
more information from the Liquidator. Of
course, my honourable friends will realize that
I resigned myself to the action of thse Committee, because I felt that the measure as
presented did not meet with the approval of
the majority in this Chamber. My honourable friend himself referred to that situation
yesterday. There vas undoubtedly an adverse opinion on the measure as presented to
this Chamber, as was manifested by the discussion, and I agreed that the substitute
measure should be sent to the Commons in
order to try to obtain a compromise which
would to a large extent satisfy the vast majority of the depositors. I made the necessary
reservation when the Bill came from the
Committee so that I could indicate clearly
to the Senate that I had no mandate from
the Government to accept the substitute
measure which then came before this Chamber. Now my honourable friend should
nominate the representatives.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Not entirely. If I assume the responsibility of
nominating the majority of the Managers, I
certainly must insist on my honourable friend
nominating at least two from his side of the
House, because the conclusion arrived at on
the Bill was peculiarly unanimous. My honourable friend moved the third read:ng of
the Bill.

JUNE 25, 1925
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I stated under
what circumstances I moved the third reading; and if my honourable friend will look
into the precedents he will fini that the
appointment of the conferees is in the hands
of those who represent the majority. My
honourable friend has already nominated three
representatives, who with himself would make
four, and I would have no objection to his
selecting a fifth member from among those
who are supposed to hold Liberal tenets.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There ought
to be two.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Well, my honourable friend can add the names of the Honourable- Mr. Béique and Honourable Sir Allen
Aylesworth.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: As I understand
the motion, it is:
That a Message be sent to the House of Commons
to inform that House that the Senate agrees to a
Free Conference, and that it has appointed the Right
Hon. Sir George E. Foster, Hon. G. G. Foster, Hon.
Senator Black, Hon. Sir James Lougheed, Hon. Sir
Allen Aylesworth, and Hon. Mr. Béique as Managers to
act on behalf of the Senate.

The motion was agreed to.
ROYAL GRAIN COMMISSION
INQUIRY

On the notice:
By the Honourable Mr. Gillis:
That he will inquire from the Government:
1. What was the total cost of the Royal Grain Commission authorized by Order in Council, May 1, 1923,
including cost of printing Report?
2. What amount (if any) was paid for drafting the
1925 Grain Act and to whom paid?

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: May I ask if that information will be returned before the end of
the Session?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have been
pressing the Department for an answer to
that question, and I am informed indirectly
that the Department of Trade and Commerce
had sent its answer to the Secretary of State,
but that apparently some further information
frorm another Department is necessary to complete the answer. I will try to find out where
the difficulty lies.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: If I could get an answer
to the first question, I would not be so particular about the other one.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That may be
where the difficulty is. If I can get an
answer to the first question I will bring it
down.

SOLDIER SETTLEMENT BILL
FIRST READING

Bil 208, an Act to amend the Soldier Settlement Act, 1919.-Hon. Mr. Dandurand.
SECOND READING POSTPONED

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think we have
on our files this Bil as introduoed in the
House of Commons, but we have not the Bill
as passed by that House. It contains but one
clause, and, if there is no objection, I will
read ýthe clause, and we may possibly agree to
the Bill, without postponing its consideration
to another sitting.
The section is as follows:
1. The Soldier Settlement Act, 1919, chapter seventyone of the statutes of 1919 (first session) as amended
by chapter nineteen of the statutes of 1920, and by
chapter forty-six of the statutes of 1922, is further
amended by adding the following section:
67. Notwithstanding anything in this Act, in the
case of any settler who has nat repaid his indebtedness
to the Board, or who has not abandoned his land, or
whose agreement with the Board has not been terminated
or rescinded, the Board shall credit his account with
an amount, in reduction of his indebtedness to the
Board. determined as follows:
Forty per cent of the purchase price of ail live stock
advanced to the settler and purchased prior to the first
day of October, 1920;
Twenty per cent of the purchase price of all live
stock advanced to the settler and purchased on or
after the first day of October, 1920, and prior to the
first day of October, 1921.
The settler's account shall be credited with the total
amount, determined as aforesaid, as on the standard
datc in 1925.

I have no brief giving me any explanation
of this policy, but we know that there have
been many suggestions, both throughout the
country and in this Chamber, that the Government should move in the direction of this
Bill. It has been stated ýthat many soldiers
bought land at the peak of the market, and
that there should be a re-valuation made in
order that they should not have to carry an
unbearable loatd. I know that my honourable
friend opposite, who was at the head of this
Department, knows more about the matter
that any other member of this Chamber, and
if he feels like agreeing to the proposition contained in the Bill, I would submit it for
second reading.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I presume
that the principile of the Bill is that the Government has scaled down the valuation of the
land and equipment furnished to soldier settiers-At a given

NEW CANADIAN

FLAG

INQUIRY

Hon..Mr. REID: I was not here at the first
part of the Session, owing to illness, but I
have lately read in ithe press an item with
reference to a new Canadian flag, and I would
like to ask the honourable leader of the Government three questions: First, is it the intention of the Government to have a new and
separate flag for Canada? Second, if so, are
we to understand that the use of the Union
Jack as our national flag is to be abandoned
and a new Canadian flag substituted? Third,
has any Order in Council been passed in connection with this matter, and, if so, will it be
laid on the Table to-day?
I ask these questions because in the Province of Ontario there is a law which makes it
compulsory to fly the Union Jack on every
school house. I understand that the Province of Quebec and other provinces have a
similar law. If this item be correct in stating
thaît an Order in Council has been passed
authorizing a new flag for Canada, we would
have two flags. I would like te know just
what has ccurred.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: l my honourable friend giving notice of the question, or
is he putting it to me directly now?
Hon. 'Mr. RFED: I am putting the question
directly to the honourable leader, because I
naturaily suppose that lie would know exaotly
whether such an Order in Council had been
ftf the honourable gentleman cannot
passe.
answer the question now, wili he answer it at
3 o'iclook, when we meet again?
Hon. Mr. DANDUR.AND: I may inform
my honourabile friend that ýfor many yeas a
flag 'has been used in our navy, and also on
land, which contained in the field of the flag,

685

besides the Union Jack, the escutcheon of
Canada. My honourable friend is as familiar
with the situation as I am, and I am very
much surprised that hie speaks of the substitution of a flag for the Union Jack. Of
course, such a. statement might 'move certain
sections of ignorant people in the country,
but it should not move my honourable friend,
who knows that there has been such a thing
as a distinct Canadian flag having the Union
Jack plus the Canadian escutcheon in the
field. There are many peuple in the country
who think that escutcheon is somewhat
difficult to distinguish at a distance. The
Montreal Witness has lately advocated substituting the maple leaf for that escutcheon.
A very loyal British Association in British
Columbia has offered a prize of $500 Io anyone submitting the best device in place of
that escutcheon in the field of the Union Jack,
which is the Canadian flag at present in use
throughout the land. The matter has been
brought before Council by a Jetter from the
hat
Right Hon. 'Mr. Fielding suggesting
something be done to make it possible to distinguish more clearly by the flag on a Canadian ship thait it is Canadian.
My honourable friend knows thet Australia,
whose people are loyal, has a distinctive flag,
though I cannot describe it. I think New
Zealand alse has its flag. In Canada, where
we are trying to blend and unite the people,
we find the individual who wraps hirmself in
the Union Jack and says, "See how nuch
more loyal I am than my neighbour." We
have heard this cry since 1867. But I think
that the people of Canada generally are
broad-minded. I am speaking not of the
ignorant, but of those who make public
opinion. They understand that there is in
Canada no line of cleavage in loyalty to the
Union Jack.
The honourable the Prime Minister bas
stated that in any study of the flag he would
resent any suggestion that the Union Jack
should not be the principal feature in whatever design is submitted to the Parliament
of Canada. That should be satisfactory to
my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. REID: I did not intend to enter
into any heated argument over this matter,
or in any way refer to the loyalty of anyone
in this country; but I do say that if an
Order in Council has been passed Parliament
is entitled to see it. I simply make the inquiry and request that a copy of the Order
in Coundil be laid on the Table.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have all the
documents for my honourable friend; but, as
he was qualifying his question, whieh will

M6

SENATE

reach the public, I did not wish to have the
public think that the country could be divided
on such petty lines.
Hon. G. G. FOSTER:
My honourable
friend who leads the Government has omitted
to tell the House that the appointment of
a Committee to study this question has been
withdrawn by Order in Council. I am not
certain of that, but believe it is truc. I saw
it reported in the press. If the statement
is correct, the people of this country should
be told that the matter is not under consideration at the moment, but will ccme up
at the next Session of Parliament, or that a
committee from both Houses would be appointed to study this very important question.
For my part, I agree entirely with the honourable' Leader of the Government on this
question. I am in favour of everything that
will bind this country to the Union Jack and
the motherland. But when the Prime Minister says, as be did in the House, "We propose to have a distinctive Canadian emblem
on the Union Jack, so that our Canadian
Flag may be recognized by every man, woman
and child in this country," I think the sugg-estion is a wise one, and should be encouraged; and no false patriotism should be
invoked by anybody to prevent Canada from
hav ing, like other British possessions, a flag
of its own.
lIon. Mr. DANDUR AND: I will bring down
the Orders in Council.
THE PENSION BOARD
CRITICISM AT CONVENTION
VETERANS

OF GREAT

WAR

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. N. A. BELCOURT: Honourable gentlemen, I desire to bring to the attention of
the House a statement which appears, in the
same words, in the two morning papers of
Ottawa. The statement I shall read is containerl in the Citizen, but it appears also in
the Journal:
Sass Square Deal Impossible Under Present Chairman
The belief that the ex-service men and their dependents in Canada would not get a "square deal" until
the present chairman of the Board of Pension Commissionuers was removed from office, or "mends his
views," was expressed at the annual convention of the
Greaut War Veterans' Association bere yesterday by
C. Grant MacNeil, Dominion secretary.
NIr. \acNeil's views were endorsed by L. W. Humphrey, Progressive member of parliament for Kootenay,
B.C., who is a delegate from Trail and Nelson
branches.
The Dominion secretary said that during
the
recent
consideration
of the
Pensions
Act
amendinents by the Senate committee, the pensions
board chairman sat
beside
the chairman
of the committee "mutilating" vital sections of the
act and paving no attention to serious cases of distress
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

on which concrete evidence had been adduced. These
clauses had been inserted after years of careful investigation by the Ralston Royal Commission and other
reputable bodies.
Mr. MacNeil said he thought the
members of the pensions board were obstructed in
their duties, and held nothing personal against the
members.
Soldiers' settlement and unemployed questions will
be considered this morning.

I think that the most elementary demands
of fair play and justice call upon this House
to deal with that statement, which was
apparently endorsed unanimously by the
Convention now sitting in Ottawa, and has
been widely published. In my opinion, we
ouglt to dissent entirely from and protest
against it.

In what I have to say of the Chairman of
the Pension Board I shall refer only to the
investigation entrusted to the Special Committee of the Senate regarding Canteen
Funds and other matters and the two Bills
on these subjects. and to the reports submitted
by that Committee. The Chairman of the
Board; his assistant,
Mr. Paton;
Mr.
Gallaugher, the auditor of the Departnent of
Soldiers'
Civil Re-establishment;
Colonel
Parkinson, the Deputy Minister of the same
Department, and several other gentlemen in
the Service, either with the Pension Board
or in the Department of Soldiers' Civil Reestablishment, were summoned to appear
before the Committee to give information
and express their views with regard to the
matters under investigation. Colonel Thompson, the Chairman of the Board of Pensions,
like his assistant, Mr. Paton, and the others,
had to obey the command of the Committee,
and lie came. They were not present at their
own suggestion or by their own will or
inclination: they were there as witnesses. The
Chairman of the Board sat for a while next
to the Chairman of the Committee, as did
Mr. Paton, Mr. Gallaugher and the others I
have named. Mr. MacNeil himself sat next
to the Chairman of the Committee whilst
giving evidence
or information. Colonel
Thompson gave information and his views
when he was questioned by the Committee.
I think every member of the Committee will
agree with my recollection that on no occasion
did he display any animus or antagonism
towards the soldiers with respect to any one
of these matters. but on the contrary, in one
instance at least, on a clause dealing with
tuberculous cases, he made a suggestion quite
favorable to the soldiers, regarding the popriety of inserting in the Bill some provision
which would be more liberal than that contained in it, in the case of tuberculous cases.
Many representatives of the different soldiers'
organizations were present, and they were all

JUNE 25, 1925
given an opportunity to place their views
fully and repeatedly before the Committee.
The statement contained in the two newspapers and the comments which Mr. MacNeil
apparently made at the Convention with
regard to tlhc Chairman of the Board are unjustifled, unfair and unwarranted, and should
be resented.
What is meant by the last part of the
paragraph I do flot know:
Mr. MacNeil said he thought the members cf the
pensions 'board were obstructed in their duties, and
held nothing personal against the members.

I have tried to understand that, 'but have
failed, and arn conüsequently flot in a position
te deal with it.
1 arn sure every memaber of the Committee
wilI endorse ail 1 have said on this matter,
and will join with me in pretesting against
the statements referred to being made and
published in the papers mentioned.
AUSTIIALIAN TRADE TREATY BIL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDUTRAND
moved the
second reading of Bull 238, an Act respecting
trade relations with Australia.
Hie said: This Bill provides:
The Minister of Finance is authorized to enter into
an agreement with the Government cf the Commonwealth of Australia under which Auatralia shall grant
to goods the produce or manufacture cf Canada when
imported into Australia the benefits cf the reduced rates
of duty set out in Schedule I to this Act, and Canada
may in return therefor grant te, goods the produce cr
manufacture of Australia when imported direct into
Canada the benefits of the rates cf customs duty set
out in Schedule Il te thia Act.

The first attempt to arrange an agreement
with Australia was made in 1893, when the
Hon. Mackenzie Bowell, Minister of Trade
and 'Commerce, went to Australia. His instructions were te confer regarding possible
trade alliance and also te arrange -for better
telegraph communications.
These negotiations were entered into
because the Canadian Government had, in
1889, autherized a subsidy of £25,0O0 for
steamship service and in 1893 Swan & Hunter,
of Newcastle-on-Tyne, offered te enter into
a contract.
The Minîster visited Australia, New Zealand, Tasmanîa and the Rawaiian Islands.
No form-aI agreement resulted from the visit.
In 1906, Mr. Deacon, as Premier of
Australia, brought bef are the House of
Representatives a proposed trade agreement
with Great Britain. There was no mnention
of Canada in it, and on being asked why
Canada was not included, he said that he had
received ne reply from Sir Wilfrid Laurier

687

te a letter which he had written. Sir Wilfrid
cabled apelogizing, stating that his letter had
been filed hy mistake, but expressed a willingness te, proceed with th* arrangements.
Before any arrangements could be entered
inte the Bill was defeated in the Huse and
the Deacon administration went eut of office.
On the 3rd May, 1913, the Right Hon. Sir
George Foster, as Minister of Trade and
Commerce, rcpqrted te Sir Robert Borden
that, following the invitation of the Minister
of Trade for New Zealand, he had several
conferences with Hon. Frank G. Tudor, Minister of State for Trade and Customs, Commonwealth of Australia, and Hlon. Francis M.
B. Fisher, representing the Dominion cf New
Zealand. Out of that conference nothing
definîte emerged, save that a conference was
arranged between the Dominions, including
South Africa, whereby it was heped that
more unifermity in custems matters could
be achieved.
In February, 1922, Senator Pearce, cf
Australia, visited Canada and made certain
representations te the Dominion Government
respecting a reciprocal tariff between Australia
and Canada. The Senator macle two proposaIs, neither cf which went far eneugh, and
the Canadian Prime Minister cabled te the
Prime Minister cf Australia suggesting that
the simplest and most convenient arrangement wculd be te exchange the Canadian
British preference for that cf Australia.
Negotiations were ýcarried on during the
summer of 1922 and the Canadian Prime
Minister then suggested te Mr. Hughes,
Prime Minîster ef Australia, that negotiations
be carried on through the High Commissioners in London. Mr. Hughes declined this,
and on the 2nd cf September ext.ended an
invitation to a Minister cf the CanadÏan
Government te visit Australia, and negotiate
dircctly with the Australian Minister of
Trade and Commerce. On September 25th
Mr. fMackenzie King eaibled to the Prime
Minister of Australia that the Ministýer of
Trade and Commerce would sail frem Vancouver on October 2Oth, 1922. Arriving in
Australia, Hon. Mr. Robb found that the
Australian Goverument was on the eve cf a
generai election, and apart from twe interviews with the Prime Minister, Mr. Hughes,
ail bis negotiatiens were carried on with the
Australian Tariff Board. In view cf the
unsettled political situation, ne definite agreement was then aehieved.
In 1923 Senator Wilson and Major Oakley,
Director General cf Custems, visited Canada,
when negotiations were further advanced. As
a result cf these negotiations an agreement
bas been arranged on the following lines:

To Canada, one of the chief advantages arising out of the treaty is that various classes of
manufactured goods will be able to be imported into Australia at a far better rate than
is now the case.
On the basis of the Canadian goods sold
to Australia during 1922-23,'the exporter to
Australia will receive a benefit of $869,058.
The mere fact of an improved rate from
Australia in the case of many commodities,
however, will have the effect of greatly increasing the demand with consequent stimulation of Canad-a's export business in that
direction.

industry of large proportions. I do not know
that the free entry of canned vegetables will
do any great harm; but we have had a protest from the canning industry, stating that
this will be a serious blow to their efforts
to establish that industry on a large scale.
The duty on dried fruit is reduced from
25 per cent to 10 per cent. This, I am told,
will very seriously affect activities in the
drying of fruits. The Government has been
spending considerable sums of money during
the last two years in trying to prove that
the fruits of British Columbia and Ontariothat is, the tender fruits such as peaches
and plums--can be dried to advantage, and
while they have established dehydrating
plants they are giving these concessions to
Australia. The population of Australia is
smail, and those engaged in the fruit-drying
business there are forced to take whatever
they can get for their very large surplus.
The results will be that their products will
be forced upon our market. For years plums
have been a drug on the market in this
country, and thousands of baskets have never
been gathered. The Government is now trying to prove that sfme varieties of those
plums can be dried, and to establish a market
in our own country, and at the same time it
reduces the duty on this item to 10 per
cent.
The next item is fresh fruits, pearsand apricots. I do not think that the reduction here
can do much harm, as their fruits come in
during a different season of the year.
Then we come to fruits in air-tight cans.
This is where the greatest harm will be done.
The reduction here is from 24 cents per
pound under general tariff te j cent per
pound. Fruit in air-tight cans is put up with
sugar. Australia bas a provision under which
the duty levied on sugar used in canned
fruits is refunded when the canned fruit is

exported. In fact, it is provided that the
sugar refiners of Australia shall not charge any
more than the world parity for sugar used
in canned goods for exports. That amounts
to k cent per pound, and the duty is reduced
', cent a pound, so that any advantage that
might be left under this Treaty is counterbalanced by the cost of sugar to the Canadian
canner.
But that is not all. The Australian Government provides not only a large bounty on
the production of canned fruit, but a still
further bounty on any that is exported,
amounting to about 3 cents a pound, and we
are put at a disadvantage if that bounty
applies to these goods under this Treaty, for
we cannot possibly can fruits in competition
with that.
Australia really bonuses te the
extent of 3 cents a pound their canned goods
sent in here, while we have no protection whatever, our small protection as a half-cent a
pound being counterbalancedý by the cheapness of sugar in Australia.
This practically
canned fruit, one of the large items, comes
in free, with a bonus of 3 cents a pound
additional to help bring it in here.
I think that the Government, in negotiating
this Treaty, should have provided that no
goods on which a bounty is paid would be
included in this Treaty and corne under these
favoured terns.
Therefore I propose to
move this amendment:
That the reduction in duty on gooda coming into
Canada under this Treaty shall not apply to gonds on
which any bounty has been paid by the Australian
Government.

I have in my hand the agreement between
the Government of Australia and the canners
there for the years 1923-24. Whether it is in
existence now I am not sure, but I believe it
is.
Under this agreement the Australian
Government proposes te pay bounties as
follows:

figures work out, in cents: on apricots, 58 cents
per dozen tins; on peaches, 66 cents; on pears,
54 cents. On one tin the bounty would be
somewhat over 5 cents, and, as a 30-ounce tin
is a little less than 2 pounds, it comes to
almost 3 cents a pound advantage which the
Australians would have under that Treaty.
It would kill entirely the fruit canning industry in Canada.

In 1923 we produced $128,000,000 worth of

exported 1,137,000 tons, or $85,000,000 worth.
In other words, we kept for our own use
only 113,000 tons of newsprint out of a total
production of 1,251,000.
Hon. Mr. CASCRAIN: We kept one-tenth.
lon. Mr. McLENNAN: Yes. To show
how these Trade Treaties affect business, in
the year 19-21 wie sent f0 Australia ýpaper to
the value of 86,000,000. A change in the
Treaty reduced that to $150,000, and it is oly
by carryiug through this Treaty and re-establishing the position of Canada on a parity
with other countries that Canada can hope
to regain the Australian trade in paper whicb
she once liad.
Take our metals. We produce metals te the
value of some SS4,000,000. Assuming that we

JUNE 25, 1925
It may not be known to a good many
menkers of this House that the building of
tais railroad is even more in the interest of
the Province of Quebec than in that of the
Province of Ontario, which will benelit to a
small extent, while Québec stands te, gain
very much more than any other 'part of
Canada. I submit that a great mistake has
been -made by some person in preventing this
railway from being completed at once.
As intimated 'by the ýletter of the .solicitors
of the railway, it is now practically built up
to the boundary line between Ontario and
Quebec, and if it should be decided by the
railway company that because of this oibstruetion they will flot go on further with the
road, the Province of Quýebec will lose millions
of dollars. I venture to say that the obstruction has corne from the Province of Quèbec
because other parties have *offered to build
a railway into, Rouyn from the Transcontinental line. It was thought at one time that
this ce'uld be done by a road of only 50
miles, but it has been since learned that
owing to the topography of the country that
is impossible, and a line several miles longer
than the first contemplated will have te be
bujît.
Tiacre is this further point, that when that
road is buiît inte Rouyn at a heavy expenditure, it will only touch a frinige of the
minerai belt. In order to get into the mining
section it will have te be built 30 miles east,
and aise 30 miles west, which would make
fiais road over 110 miles long. Even then
the road wouhl only serve the saine purpose
which the Central Nipissing would serve by
building 50 miles in Quebec, hecause it goes
rizlit through the rnineral belt.
1The advice given' te obstruet this road is
certainly bad, because millions of dollars am,~
available te 'be poured into that locality for
mmning purposes by men w.ho have learned
the game of mining in the northern part of
Ontario. Those men are now turned away
on account of this obstruction, and it will
be years before a road will be got in there
fromn any ether locality.
Why should the Department of Railways
and CanaIs ibe withholding this order at
present? I understand the precedure they
might adopt is te have an Order in Couneil
passed subjeet te the Province of Québec
indicating whatever objetions it has te it;
but tihougli these papers were filed on March
31, ne Order in Council bas issued from, the
Department.
The two Provinces being interested in this
matter-the Province of Ontario owning the
railway, and the Province of Quebec Ibeing &
party te the territory it is entering, it seeme

69î

te me that any dispute ceuld be easily
adjusted. This sheuld be done, because
already the 'bad feeling caused in certain
q&tarters eould be allayed by giving this rai!-way the rights which it evidently possesses
thro-ugh having obtained this charter.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Hýoneurable gentlemen, the territory referred te is in the Province of Quebeo, and is deemed te be very
valitale froua the point of view of mining
industries: it is thought to be another Cobalt,
and may possibly be greater than Cobalt.
There is a difference between the Provinces
of Ontario and Quebc in regard te this
territory. The Province of Ontario would like
te secure whatever business is te, be derived
th-erefrom, while the Prevince of Quebec
thinks it should be allowed te keep its wealth
within its own territory. T-hat is the situation.
I suggest that the honeurable gentleman
reverse the proposition. Suppose that when
Cobalt, in Ontario, was te be epened there
had been an attempt on the part of the Province cf Quebec te draw is wealth te that
Province; I think there would have been on
the part of the Province of Ontarie an eutcry, which would have been very well founded.
I think each Prevince should be allowed te
keep its wealth in its own territery without
interference. That is the whole situation, and
1 cannot appreciate the objections of my
honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: It appears te me
that thaL is a very narrow view te take.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I would remmnd my haourable friend that this matter
eannot be settled by the Senate of Canada.
In view cf the pretest against the building of
this railway into and across provincial Crown
lands in the Province of Quebec, and the
affirmation that the Company had ne legal
right to build it without the consent of the
Government of the Province of Quebec, what
could the Government of Canada de but
refer the matter te the Supreme Court? It
has done se; therefore we must wait till tlaat
Court pronounces on the question.
Hon. Mr. 'GORDON: I asked for a return of ail the papers and correspondence in
this matter, and 1 find ne intimation in
them that this matter hýas been referred te
the Supreme Court.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My henourable friend may think that I should have informat~ion an ail the matters that pase in
OouneiI, but 1 refer te my honourable friend
the leader of the Conservative party in this
Chamber. When lie was in the position which

SENATE
I now occupy I remember fairly well that
in the last weeks of the Session he had hardly
time to have his meals, and none to go to
Couneil.
The information I give to my
honourable friend I have gathered in the
press, or perhaps in reports of what has taken
place in another place. My honourable friend
would perhaps like to see the Order in Council, and if so I will try to get it.
Hon. Mr. GORDON:
Has an Order in
Council been passed?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
As far as I
have been informed through ordinary channels. A statement has heen made in another place, and I would be very much surprised if my memory failed me in stating
that the matter had been referred to the
Supreme Court.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: The last letter the
solicitors had from the Department would
indicate that no Order in Council has been
passed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I will get that
information before 8 o'clock to-night.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: If in order, I would
like to say to the honourable gentleman from
De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique) that the
view he bas taken of the situation is rather
a narrow one for a gentleman who has always
shown himself to be broad-minded.
Railrpads, particularly those with Dominion charters, are supposed to be built for the general
advantage of Canada, and it would be absurd for any province to say that it would
not allow the traok of a road to enter its
territory because it might bring a little trade
to a town in another province.
As an illustration of how the Ontario Governmont looks upon such a situation, I may
say that only two years ago it allowed the
British American Nickel Company, which
was then operating at Sudbury and wished
to erect a very large plant for the purpose of
refining nickel, to erect that plant in the
province of Quebec.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: That is not a similar
case at ail.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: To my mind it is.
On questions of this nature I think it would
be fur better for ail the provinces to consider
that they arc a part of Canada.
NEW

CANADIAN

FLAG

ANSWER TO INQUIRY

Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gentlemen, I was asked this morning to produce the Orders in Council concerning the
design of a Canadian flag. Here is the Order
in Council of April 23, 1925:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Ti Committee of the Privy Council have had before
the- a Report, dated 21st April, 1925, from the Minister of National Defence, stating that a distinctive
Canadian Flag bas been authorized to be used by
Canadian Government owned vessels and by other
versels of Canadian registry, and that there is throughout the country a desire that there should also be
adospted for use ashore a distinctive Flag which shal
be recognized as the Flag of the Dominion of Canada.
The Minister, therefore, recommends that a comnittee be appointed to consider and report on the
iost suitable design that should be adopted for a
Canadien National Flag for use ashore, and that this
committee be composed of the following:
G. J. Desbarats, Esq., C.M.G., Deputy Minister of
Netional Defence-Chairnan.
Thomas Mulvey, Esq., B.A., K.C., Under-Secretary
of State.
A. G. Doughty, Esq., C.M.G., L.L.D., Dominion
Archivist.
Commodore Walter Hose, C.B.E., A.D.C., Dire-ar
of the Naval Service.
Major-General H. A. Panet, C.B., C.M.G., D:S.O.,
AdJutant General.
Croup Captain J. S. Scott, M.C., A.F.C., A.D.C.,
Acting Director of the Royal Canadian Air Force.
The Committee concur in the ,foregoing recommendation antd submit the same for approval.
(Sgd.)
E. J. Lemaire,
Clerk of the Privy Council.

Another Order in Council was passed on
the 20th of June:
The Comiiiittee of the Privy Council have had before
thei a report, dated 20th June 1925, from the Minister
o National Defence, subimîitting that in accordance with
representations
made in Parliament by the Prime
Mii.ter on the 17th June, 1925, with respect to the
should be followed in regard to the
piocedure that
qiie.ioi of the adoption of a Canadian National Fla,
forluse ashoie and that it is desirable that the matter
sldiiI le
dci-ided by Parliament before any acti2n
should be taken thereon by a Cotmittee, and recommending for these resons that the Order in Council
if the 23rc
April. 1925 (P.C. 623) appointing a Commtittee to consider and report on the most suitable
design for a Canadian National Fiag for use asho:e,
be canîcelled.

The Committee concur in the foregoing, and advise
tha: the said Order in Council be cancelled, accordingly.

So very likely a Committee of the House
of Commons or a Committee of the Senate
can examine this matter next Session.
PENSION BILL
CONSIDERATION

OF MESSAGE FROM

HOUSE OF COMMONS

The Senate proceeded to consider the Message from the House of Commons disagreeing to certain amendments made by the Senate
to Bill No. 70, an Act to amend the Pension
Act.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT moved:
Resolved, that the Senate doth insist upon its 17th
amendient to Bill 70, an Act to amend the Pension
Act, but doth iot insist upon its 13th, 14th and 15ti
amendiments. to which the House of Commons bath
disagreen.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, the House
of Commons has refused to accept a number
of the amendments which were made by the

699

JUNE 25, 1925
Senate -Committee and subsequently adopted
by this House. There are three amendments
upon which the Commons are in disagreement with the Senate, and which they insist
shouid be withdrawn.
The Committee has instructed me to report
that on two of these amendments we would
flot insi.st, but there is one on wb.ich we do
insist, namely our amendment of this section:
16. Subsection one of section eleven of chapter sixtytwa of the statutes of 1923 is repealed and the following sUtsection is substituted therefor:
"il1. (1) Upon the evidence and oecord upon which
th'-, Board of Pension Commisioners gave their decision
ali appeal shall lie in respect of Boy refusai of pension
by the Board of Pension Commissioners on the ground
thar the injury or disease or aggravation thereof resulting in disability or death was ont attributable to
or was flot incurred during military service or was the
result of misconduct."

We have amended that clause and the
lieuse of Commons; is flot prepared to accept
our amendment. The Committee recommend insistence on the part of this House,
with respect to our amendment.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Do I understand the
honourable member to state, with regard to
section 16, that the Commons wish us to
withdraw our amendment by which we struc
out the last six w*ords, "or was the resuit of
misconduct"?
Hon. *Mr. BFiLCOURT: If honourable
members w.ish, I will state the reason why,
in the opinion of the .Committee, ;ve ouglit
to insist upon that amendment. The Act
provides that there shall bc no pension where
the disability is the resuit of vicious conduct
on the part of the soldier. Apparently a controversy ha arisen be-tween the Pension
Board and the Appeal Board on that subject. Mention has been made, for instance,
of a case in which the Pension Boa-rd found
that the disability was the resuit of misconduct. The case wus appealed, and the Appeal
Board found -that the disability was nlot the
resuit of misconduet. On a diagnosis furnished to the Pension Board it was claicned
that it was the result of pneumonia or some
other disease. The purpose of the amendiment rnoved and adopted in the Senate Committee was to p rotect the Public Treasury to
a considerable extent, and for that reason we
think we ought to insist upon our amnendment.
Section;. 3 of the Bill reads as follows:
3 Subsection five of section twenty-three of the isid
Act is repealed and the followiog is substituted therefor:<(5)The ch'Idren of a peosioner who was pensioned
in any of Classes i to 5 meotioned in Schedule A and
wh9- has died. shall be entitled te a pension as if he
hal died on service whether his death was attributable
to his serv.ce or not, provided that the death occurs

within tee years after the date of retirement or discharge or the date oi tihe commencement of pension."

If I remember correctly, the provision with
regard te a case of this sort wau five years.
The five years have expired, or stre about
to expire. The purpose of the p~rovision mnakmng the period ton years was to grant a dolay
of five years more, during which the clause
might apply. The Cornmittee has -come to
the conclusion that it is net imperative or
essential to insist upon our amendiment, and
tha.t it should be waived; that is, in other
words, we should agree with the Commons.
Section 9 is a similar provision, but is
applicable to a widow, whereas section 3
appliec, to> the children of a pensioner. The
same princip!e is involved. Under the same
circumstances and for the saine reason Wr'
think we ought flot to insist on our amendment to section, 9.
1 agreed with
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the view held by the honourablo Sonator from
Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Grieshach), that we
should allow the appoal to the Appeal Board
in cases where the Boardl of Pension Commissionens had detclared. that death was due to
misconduct. I thouglit we shôuld not insist
upon the amendinent submittod iby the Com-.mittee.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This is
a fair oxchange. We have to give way on
some points, and I think this is the better one
to yield. In this way, under sections 3 and 9.
we make provision for the wido.ws and the
childiren.
Hon. Mr. BE]LCOURT: The only amendment upon which we are insisting is the one
to wh'ieh the honourable leader of the Govorninent (Hon. Mr. Dandurn<i) lia juist
alluded. We insist upon the provision with
respect to misconduct remaining in the Act.
The Houso of Commono want that clause
strieken out and are insisting upon- their own
provision.
The motion was agreed to.
AUSTIIALIAN TRADE TREATY BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING

The Senate resumed consideration of the
motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand for the second
reading of Bill 238, an Act respecting trade
relations with Australia.
I would ask
lon. Mr. DANDURANID:
chat Mr. Russell, of the Finance DopartmeTlt,
come to the floor.
Hon. EI)WARD 'MICHENER: Honourabi.z gentlemen, before the adjourninont I rose

'00

SENATE

to second the amendment presented by the
honourable member from Wentworth (Hon.
Mr. Smith) that the reduction of duty on
goods admitted into Canada under this Treaty
should not a.pply to goods upon which any
bounty has been paid by the Australian iGovernment. The honourable leader of the Government, however, informed us that these
bounties have all expired. Is that correct?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
These bounties
have la.psed, according to the Australian Year
Book., which I have before me. But I may
give this further information to my honourable friends who are interested in this aspect
of the Treaty-and they are not alone-that
if any bounty applied to any class of goods
having the advantage of the Treaty, they
would be met by the anti-dumping regulation.
I speak of bounties on goods for export.
Hon. Mr. MICHENER: I was going to
speak on that aspect; but I presume that, in
view of the fact mentioned by the honourable
leader, the honourable member for Wentworth
will not insist upon his amendment.
While on my feet, however, I wish to make
a few observations, as briefly as possible. The
honourable member for Wentworth presented
some serious disadvantages with respect to
certain phases of the Treaty, particularly regarding the dried and canned fruit business.
We produce something like $30,000,000 worth
of fruit in Canada.
I do not wish, however,
to traverse ground that has been covered so
ably by the honourable member for Wentworth, but will refer more particularly to
certain phases of mixed farming, especially
dairying and stock raising, in which we in the
Province of Alberta are very much interested.
There were distributed among us just before
ad.journment copies of a circular from the
Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, setting
forth the advantages of this Treaty to the
pulp and paper industry.
We are told that
trade for that industries is available in Australia to the extent of $7,500,000, whereas the
value of pulp and paper manufactured in the
Dominion of Canada is $140,000,000 a year,
and the industry, it is urged, has a capital
nvestment of $400,000,000.
It is of course an
important industry in Canada and is worthy
of every consideration; but I wish to contrast
the advantages that are to accrue to that industry with the disadvantages that may accrue
to some phases of mixed farming throughout
the Dominion.
We have invested in live stock in the
Dominion of Canada-principally dairy cattle,
stockers, hogs an sheep-$1,292,000,000.
We
all
know the disadvantages
of
our climatic
conditions
in the
winter
lHon. Mr. MICHENER.

time,
and the
advantages
enjoyed. in
that respect by Australia.
The Australians
pasture their stock the year around.
Their
meat can be raised much more cheaply than
ours.
With regard to the dairy industry, in the
Province of Alberta in 1900 we produced only
$123,000 worth of butter, but last year, 1924,
we produced nearly $10,000,000 worth.
The
farmers of Western Canada no longer expect
to make their fortunes quickly out of graingrowing, but are coming down to a solid basis
of mixed farming, particularly dairying and
stock raising.
Dairying is an industry which
at present prices is not very profitable, though
it is true it provides a living for the farmer
and his family for 365 days in the year.
In
the Province which I represent the farmers
have gone more and more into dairying. They
have equipped their places with good warm
barns; they have installed silos, and in many
cases milking machines, and all the equipment
of a modern dairy.
To-day Alberta produces
butter which is second to none in any part of
the veorld, and this is largely due to the fact
thit the nights in that part of the country
are cold and there is a moderate climate in
the summer.
As I have stated. there is very little profit
in the dairy business at present prices, and
even a very slight reduction of duty, opening
our home market to products of other
countries which can produce more cheaply,
is a serious matter for the people of Alberta.
I wish to call particular attention, 'honourable
gentlemen, to this faet, that in the winter
time, when we in Alberta produce butter at
a maximum cost, Australia is enjoying its
summer season and can produce at the
minimum ost. So the advantage given to
the Australian farmers, with respect to
butter especially, of 3 cents a pound, makes
it possible for them to flood our markets
with their summer butter, produced at a
minimum cost, and it comes into competition
with our winter butter, produced at a minimum
cost. This must have one of two effects: it
must either reduce the price of our butter in
our home market or discourage the dairying industrv in that Province to a very large
extent. Instead of the Government reducing
the protection which the farmers now have
upon those basic products of agriculture, there
is an immediate need, it seems to me, of
increasing the duties so that ibhey will be
more in line with those imposed by the
United States. The honourable member for
Wentworth (Hon. Mr. Smith) showed this
morning how the farmers of Canada might
have been protected, and how justice could

JUNE 25, 1925
stili have been doue to Australia under the
Treaty. But such a provision Ihas flot been
made.
TPhe farmers of Alberta are having a hard
time getting along at present, and their difficuities are Iargely owing to the tariff. 'In
Alberta there was a profitable business done
in shipping hay, for exemple ta Pacifie coast
points; but, because there was flot sufficient
duty upon the coarser grains, the produet af
the State of Washington was shipped by boat
ta Vancouver and Victoria, and had an
advantage there, over Alberta hay because
the American producers did flot have the long
mountain haul whieh iconfronted the fariners
of Alberta. In that way they were able ta
undermine the business carried] on 'y the
Alberta farmc¶,s. A few ycars ago we soId
aur rough cattie, aur stockers, on the Chicago
market; ta-day the duty shuts us out of that
market.
Now the Government say we will sacrifice
stili further the farmers af Alberta by
encouraging competitian in the few things
that they have Meêt from which ta make a
bare living; we will open the home mnarket
to the fermers of Australie, who can reise
their stock far haif what it. costs us ta. raise
ours, and who can praduce their butter at a
minimum coet when we are prod&ucing et a
maximum cost. To what extent this will affect
the deirying industry and the stock-raising
ind-ustry 1 arn not prepared to say, but I arn
certain that the effect will ha very detrimental.
For ane thing, it will diseourage mixed
farrning-dairying and stoc-k-raising-in that
Province, and 1 presumne it will have a similar
effect throughout the Dominion of Canada.
I notice that in the Province of Ontaria
to-day there is flot the production cf dairy
produets that, there wes a few years ago.
The farmers need encouragement rather than
discouragernent; they n-eed adventafes rather
than disadventages. It does seern ta me,
honourable gentlemen, thet, we are secrificing
the farining interestis of this country for bhe
benelit of a few cepitalists who rnay find a
market for S7A50,000 worth of paper and
pulp. Are we going ta sacrifice the markets
af ail the fermers af this Dominion, amounting ta about 6300,000,000 ini dairy produets
alone, and hundreds of millions in stock,
simply ta give a f ew cepitelists another
market for their paper and pulp?
It does seem to me that we are teking an
unfair advantege of the fermers af tbis country, in expoeing themn to an unfair competition. For these reesons and others that
I oould mention, and which will prc&>ably be
enumerated by ot.her honourable gentlemen,
I do flot, sec how I cen support this Treaty

701

as it stands. It seems to me that the benefits
under it are nat at ail commenaurete with
the disedvantages that wilýl accrue ta, the
country.
Hon. R. H. POPE: Honourable gentlemen, we have said over and aver again in
this louffe, and it has been repeated from yeer
ta year since I came here, and 1 presume the
same is true af the yeers beflore that, that
the Government of the day does not give us
an opportunity of studying the important
mewasures when thcy camne ta us from the other
flouse et the close af the Session. If that is
true of ordînary Bills, and it bas been truc,
it is mor'e than true of this ana, whieh will
affect the mai ority of the producing people of
Canada. This Treaty en have no other affect
than a detrimaental one upon the great farming community of this country. I care not
whether thay ha east or west, there is not a
clause, nat a word, i this Treaty that is in
favour oi aur great egricultural community.
Some of us have found feuit because a Progressive Party or a Fermera' Party wes organi zed; but when I see haw littie consideration is givan by either flouse of Parliement ta
the Most important oi ahl the industries of
Canada. I amn not surprised or diseppointcd
that there has sprung up in tis coun.try a
th-ird party in the palitical field, misguided
th-ougli it mey be.
The niegleet of the waifae of the farming community by the aid
parties, bath Liberaji and Conaervative, i8
responsible for the division that bas taken
place. 1 rasent most emphatiaùUy the idea
thet it is possible for a Goveinsent ta bring
before us in the last two days of the Sessionand nat only bafore us, but before the public
and the business maen of Canada-,a Treaty
which it knew of last Octoher and wbich was
prepared months and months aga. It is almost inconceivable that such a thing should
ha possible in what we caîl a constitutionallygoverned country, and that the people should
be asked ta have confidence in any Administration that would direct such a blow et the
country life af Canada. Honoureble gentlemen have stood up in this House and in another place on this and on previous occasions,
and have stated, and wc have read ini the press
and in the magazines of the country, that
something must ha done ta keep the farmers'
sons upon the ferai, ta bring immigrante ta this
country and place them upon the land. And
ta, th.ink that abnost in the same breath, without publie notice, in a oowerdly mannerHon. Mr, DANDtTRAND: Order.
Hon. Mr. POPE: -the Goverument dare
prasent such e measure as this against the

SENATE
farming community of the Dominion!l It may
flot appear so to others. who do flot live in
the country as I do, and who have flot seen
family after famiiy leaving the country and
parish after parish deserted by the f armers, but
it is astounding to me. There is no use sayig that the people are flot leaving the land.
Any man who lýives in any parish in the Province of Quebec, or in any constituency in
Ontasrio or the West, knows that people are
compelled to leave this country of ours; and,
iu the face of thet, without a word of warning, the Government cornes down with this
new proposi4tion for trade with Australia.
Austral:a, did 1 sey? No, flot Australia alonie,
because clause 5 says:
Suibject to the provisions of the customs tariff, 1907,
t1iý Governor in Council may, by Order in Gouncil,' extend the said advantages to goods the oroduce or
inai'facture of any British country.

Wr are flot opening the door to Australia
alone; we are opening the door to ali British
rountries. Let me read a list of them:
Uited Kingdom, Aden, Australia, Barbados,' Ber.
miîda, British East Africa, British South Africa, British
West Africa, British Guiana, British Honduras, British
Iîîdia, British East Indies, British West Indie, British
Oceania, British Strait Settlements, Ceylon, Fiji Islands,
Gambia, Gibraltar, GoId Coast, Hong Kong, Jatuaica,
Malta, Newfoundland, New Zealand, Nigeria, Palestine,
Sieria Leone, Trinidad, and Tobago.

There are 29 in ail. If you pess this Bill
you are giving the Government power to do
th9t, and if they are so indifferent to the interests of the people of Canada as to bring
down tisis measure without giving us an opportunity of studying it and knowing sorntbing
about it, they are quite capable of opening
the door to any of those people. voit will
find dutiable goods amouinting to $157.000.000
and freo goods amounting to $37.000,000 com.nsc into Canada from thoee counitries. Therefore we are opening the door to ail British
po~sssîons.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is a good
word.
Hon. Mr. POPE: British possessions is a
,ood word, and there are certain people who
stand for the permanency of the British Empire, and there are others who do not. We
nerd flot argue about that. We ail know the
story, and it need not be told over again.
Nýow, so far as this country is concerned,
we are told that wve cannot export certain
products-butter, cheese and cettle. Why de
we export them? It is 'because we produce
more than we cen consume. We do not export them for the fun or the pleesure there is
in it; we export them hr.cause wé' are enmpelled to export.
Hon. Mr. DANDUDAND: For profit.
Hon. Mr. POPE.

Hon. Mr. POPE: Not always for profit. If
we have not a home markct for the goods
here, we are bouind to grow indifferent. We
are bound to have indifferent farms, and they
are not rxl)orted for profit. What do you do?
You make a Treaty witls a country called
Australie, where y~ou cen buy beef for $1.75,
or an animal from $15 to $17, and a firstclass steer for $22 or $25. I know what I ams
talking about. And you are going to ask us
to compete simply bccause we have a surplus of certain thingoQ to export. I am surprisedl et the Finance Minister saying- that
if hce thouglit this Treaty wouîd interfere
îvitb tbe people produring butter and cows in
bis Countv of Chatrauguay-Huntingdon, which
he said was the secondl largest eouinty in that
regard in Canada. he would niot present the
mneasure. Well, if that is the basis upon which
national affairn. are to be ronducted, then 1
:ay ovrry honourable gentlenman in whose
coiiimiinitv there are farnss is bound to teke
loto consitleration local îorosperity and to
keep in nîind cx eîv individual in bis romusunity who ruitivates the soil.
But we
know that if it werù not for the fart that the
milk taken fromi the countx' of Chateauguay11luntingdon was consumed in Montreal. a haif
or a (4uarter of the cows would not be there.
''lie local market of Montresl takes rare of
tilt industry for more than 100 mniles eround.
It is the localsia:rket in whieb we dispose of
90 peùr cent of the azrieultural produrîs of this
country. andi if it w'ere îlot for the wvbeat
which we export. tie figure would be nearer
100 per eent, sud there would be very little
iu proportion to the total production that we
%vouldnet consume ourizelves. It is quite true
that we ship) a certain amount of butter when
wr are obliged to. Wr do not sbip it because wve want to or berause we get more for
it. but becauise. rluring e couple of months of
tIse year, Wr havsxe not a market for it in
Canada.
The saine is true avith regard to
ele~.But m.s
tbat auy reason why ave should
open our doors for twelve months in the year
and submit to the competition of a country
whirh can produre cheaper than, we cen?
There is no use savln, that we cen produce agrirsîltural producîs as chraply as they
cen ho produced in Australia and Nrw Zealand with their milder climate. Look at tIse
arrangement and sec what, it is. Take fresh
oseat, for instance. If you want to send it to
Australia you have to pey à cents a pound

dred; they corne into, Canada free. On canned
fruits in pint tins we pay $1.00 per dozen, or
8ý cents per tin or pound; they pay J cent per

.$2.12 per dozen, or 17 cents per tin of 2
pounds and they pay j cent per pound. On
canned vegetabIes we pay 30 per cent ad

theirs corne in free. On beeswax we pay 2
cents per pound; their cornes in free. On
honey we pay 4 cents a pound; they pay 1

chee.e we pay 6 cents per pound ;their
cheese cornes in free. On eggs we pay 18
cents a dozen; their corne in free. On dried
apples and peaches we pay 8 cents per pound;they pay 10 per cent. On lard we pay 4 cents
a pound; theirs cornes in free. On. tallow
we pay $1 per hundredweight; they pay 10
per cent.
Then, I wiIl take sorne other airticles to show
how Australian production is protectedý. On
wheat we pay 50 cents per hundred pounds;
on flour 62 cents per hundred pounds; on fresh
fruits $1.50 per hundred pounds; on bacon andl
hanis, 8 cents pet pound; on biscuits, 4 cents
per pound; on jams and jellýies, 6 cents per
pound; on condensed, milk, 5 cents per pound.
And to-day we have stored away in the Dominion of Canada 15,000,000 pounds of New Zealand cheese, ready to cornpete with thJe cheese
wve
produce in this country.
If we must rnake a Treaty with Australia,
for Heaven's sake why was there not an effort
maýde to obtain reciprocal treatrnent? Are we
not entitled to fair play? Is t>he 'farner of
this country not -entitled to, the consideration
of this Goverrnent just as rnuch as is the rnan
in Australia or in other countries that we make
this contract witb. This Treaty lead8 on and
on. It is not finLîhed to-day.
A great effort has been mnade to iznpress us
in regard tu the pulp and pa:per business of
Canada. The pulp business for Canada in
Australia bas neyer arnounted to rnucb, because we have always been beaten out by
treaty. The consurnption of paper in Australia
in 1924 was about $15,000,000 wortb, while ours,
it is said, dropped to $800,000. It bad dropped
to about 31,500,000 in previous years, after
the 15 per cent preference was given to England. We have not a rnonopoly of the supply
of paper. Sweden, Norway and Denrnark are
ail doing business in that line in Australia.
They have no preference, yet they have increased their business. Canada is the only
country which has dropped bebind, and we
seem. to have suffered from. the 15 per cent

preference given to England.

M0

We ail know
that England is not a centre for the rnanufacture of raw paper; she deals in paper as
in wool and rnany other things, because of
lier shipping facilities in reaching the world
markets.
I arn anxious that the pip and paper industry of this country should have its chance;
but I amu sure t'be gentlemen who are interested in that industry, wbicb bas been encouraged in various ways. wobld not care to combine against the success of the agricultural industry of this country.
I believe that if the publishers of newspapers fully rea.lized the immense danger to
agriculture involved in this Treaty, tbey would
Publish articles placing the agricultural coinmunity and the business men of Canada in
toucb with the real situation.
Take tbe question of mutton, for instance:
AuÊtralia does not care the snap of bier finger
for that. She cares for wool, and if she gets,
50 cents or $1 for a sheep, it is clear gain.
If she can send those animais over and net $3
here, sbe is well satisfied.
But as those
animais corne in, down go the prices of ours,
and the sarne remark appiies to cattle.
We are dealing with a nation that must
have a perfect systern of coid storage, because aIl its produets have to go long distances, to Engiand and Central Europe.
Those produce go to nations of deVeiate
ta.ste, wbicb have been fed on the beut of
wbat Europe could produce. Under these circurnstanees, Australia must produce tbe best.
That country took instructors frorn us 15
years ago, to raise the standard of its product of butter and cheese, so, tbat to-day,
I say 'without hesitation, its product is equal
if not superior to rnucb that we produce, and
it takes high rank in the mnarkets of the
world. We are rnsking a trade with a nation
that bas learned bow to piroduce much better
th-an we do; that spends rnilions in the refinement of its produet.
We Vie aur cattie up frorn Octoher until
the middle of May or the first of June of
the next year, and rnust be f ed by band with
products that cost money to produce, that
bave had to he sown and fertilized, rncwn
and raked, pitcbed and put into tbe barn.
If the Canadian fariner is feeding for milk,
hle must feed bran at $30 a ton, and rneal
at $40 or $50 a ton. Ia this Goverpnent
justified in opening Up cornpetition against us
by a country where cattie are at grass the
year round, where there is no hand-feeding
required, and no expense for stabling, while
Canadian farinera must build solid barns
and other structures, and invest $5,000

or $l5,000 in addition to the
price of the farm. in order to, take
proper care of their stock?
By this
Treaty you wi.ll open wide the door and
bring us into competition with those people,
wvhen our farmers are working day in and
day out in order to make a living, and having a difficuit job to do that. 1 know whereof I speak. There is no pleasure or profit in
farming to-day. Our farmers are struggling,
and miany have not been able to keep going.
With the foreign markets as they are now,
the home market is the real market, after
ail. But we are saying to the farmers of
Canada: "Thou shalt prosper by baving the
home market opened up to the cheapest producing nation in the world, who will drive
you from the market of your own land."
By this policy you will drive the farmers off
théir land. This is no imaginary statement:
it is an absolute reality to-day. And yet we
have chattered over this Treaty for two days.
Hon. Mr. DYAVID: Will the honourable
meniber tell me if the farmers and the different Boards of Agriculture in the country
have protest-ed against this Treaty, and
against that competition which tbey fear so
much?
Hon. Mr. POPE: I have made objections
to Ibis Treaty for the very reason that nobody in the country knows anything about
il, and wc do noV know very much ourselves.
We want three days in which to study it.
The man in the country bas had no time at
ail, and I say you are taking an unfair adx antage of him; you are putting both hands
under in order to throw bim; you do flot
even give himn a fair backhold Vo wrestle in
Ibis great contest that is before us. I say
we are taking great riâks. We talk of this
country being settled witb honest, moral
,people of good character, bot they are flot
aliowed to seli tbeir neighbour iwbat they
produce. Yet the man from. Australia, from
New Zealand, from A.frica, from, anywhere,
can send bis produ-ce in here.
Why does the Goverenent d<o this thing in
the face of wbat bas been gning on ini Caaada for the last two or tbree years? Half a
million people have left us. They did flot
]eave because tbey wanted Vo, but because
tbey bad to. Every faetory that closes,
every one tkat goes out of business in the
great centres, gives a rap at the possibility
of agriculture. Every farmer in ouïr country
kiaows that tlae h.ome market is hie real
maarket, and eyery time you close the door
in any of the great oeeNtres you injure the
f armer.
Hon. Mr. POPE.

1 do not wisb to criticize tbe pulp and
paper people, but tbcy are wiping out a vcry
valuable asset, and very few of tbem arc doing anythinýg to rbplace it. Tbey are cutting
down tbe primneval forest that was left by
our grandfathers, and very few are reforcstiag. Every time we sbip away 100,'000 cords
of pulpwood, or tons of news paper, we are~
shitpping away valuable assets from tbis country. On the contrary, if you give agriculture
an opportunity, and give farmers a chance of
a livelibood, you bave manure piles bebind
the barns, so that instead of taking away
from the fertility of tbe soil you arc givin.g
everytbing back in return.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Are the farmers content with the home market for their prod-uets?
Hou. Mr. POPE: Absolutely. In the days
gone by tbey were mnisled by political intrigu.',
and were told that protection xvas only for
the big interests, for tbe capitalists. I did
not intend to go into tbat matter. Sir Wilfrid Laurier came into power in 1896, at a
time of prosperity, and that remained until
we bad a panie in 1907. The world had 14 or
15 years of wonderful prosperity. Sir Wilfrid
Laurier did not l'cwer the tariff. If bie d.'d
anytbing to it at ail] he raised it a litIle, and
a development took place. But now from
one end of the country to the other the farmers bave been feeling the pinch, hecause when
taxes are paid tbe farmer must pay bis portion, whether in the form of customs duties
or excise, wheVher directly or indirectly. Then
we had a great war, and things went down
again. This Government came in, not in
au ara cf prosperity, but two or three yeas
after the war, and everybody knows wbat
bappens to any part of th.e world after a
war, unless extraordinary effort* is put foi'ward. Franýce put forward an effort with a1
tariff; England bas restrictions; Germany and
Belg-ium and other countries have them, and
are doing everything to protect themselvesý.
We had a tariff for the farmers in 1878, and
it wvas not disturbed until 1889, the last yc.ti,
of Sir John Macdonald, and hie raised the
tariff on nieat from 1 cent to 3 cents a pound.
These are the only two things that were done
for the farmer, botb by Sir John Macdonald,
the first ini 1878, and the last in 1889.
I would like to put on Ilansard the exact
duties that this Treaty carrnes with it, so
far as agriculture is eoncerrned. I think the
liat slould be madle availa-ble in order that
amyone taking the trouble to look at Ha.nsard
wild find the positioni in which we are placeul.

The Department of Agriculture spent last
year about $900,000 in sending agents throughout the Dominion to teach us how to sort
eggs--how to tell a small one from a big
one; how to look after our becs; how to improve our stock by better breeding, better
feeding, getting rid of tuberèulosis, etc,, etc.
When I mention $900,000 I refer to travelling
expenses; I do not mean the salaries of those
officials. The Department of Agriculture engages large numbers of these young men,
who are respectable, I presume, to go about
teaching us how to farm. Yet we are telling
Australia that their goods may come in free
and they may take our market. What is the
use of education if this Treaty is to be put
into force and if fruit and honey and butter
and cheese and all these products may come
into Canada free? Why should the Department of Agriculture of Canada spend $900.000
on the travelling expenses of officials. who

because if they did not have those positions
they would have had to go to the United
States to look for jobs. I do not blame them
for occupying positions in Canada when they
can get them. It is patriotic for them to
remain in this country, even though their
work may be disagreeable to the farmers.
What bas been the use of our past efforts
to improve the quality of our goods-efforts
I
which might have led to some success?
remember quite well, as though it were yesterday, our great endeavour to improve the
quality of our exports of butter and cheese
to suit the palates of the people in the Old
Country and the requirements of different
markets. We succeeded to a certain degree,
though not too well at any time, but now,
after what we have accomplished, we are
told that the way for us to get rich is to
bring into this country products which will
inevitably compete with our own. I do not
think that for the sake of a newsprint trade
amounting to $7,000,000 we are warranted in
opening up a market of $200.000.000 or $300,000,000. With the exception of wheat, our
exports are not very great, and during the
war there was a scarcity of agricultural products and we had to import a large quantity
because we did not produce enough. We d'id
not have to import any beef. If we had an
agricultural policy that would develop the
natural resources of this country the farmer
would stay on the farm and would keep bis
son there, and agriculture would be carried
on from generation to generation upon a good,
sound, profitable basis. The increased population in Canada would be sufficient to conHon. Mr. POPE.

wonderful argument, that we are exporting,
therefore we should import. I say, export,
but do not import, and I repeat, it is an
absolutely fatal mistake to open up the Dominion of Canada to a country that enjoys

member there was in that proposed reciprocity
treaty a favoured-nation clause, which permitted Australia, New Zealand and other
countries to send their goods into this market.
So far as cost of production was concerned,
I considered that the effect of that clause in
letting in goods from Australia and New
Zealand would prove more injurious to"us than
the entry of beef from the United States.
The danger in regard to the imports of beef
from the United States wasý that large
quantities would be handled very cheaply by
two or three central organizations, who could

that would have hurt us, it would not have
done the same injury as the bringing in of
goods from Australia.
The Australian Minister of Trade and Commerce, Mr. Pratten, states:
I feel confident, however, that an impartial examination will lead to the conclusion that the proposals will
provide an extended market for our surplus primary
products.

I suppose we all know what "surplus primary
products" means. They include butter, cheese,
etc.
-the disposal of which is causing us so much anxiety
at the present time, but that the successful exploitatim
of this extended market will call for an organized ad
sustained effort on our part to gain the trade fr.sn
present suppliers, chiefly the United States.
Under the proposed agreement the Commonwealth
grants to Canada reductions of duty on twelve items,
while the Commonwealth receives reductions on fourtean
main and six minor items.

Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: 'May I ask the
honourable gentleman just one question,? I
have listened to him very earefully, and I
must say that I arn at a loss to know whom
to believe. In another place Hon. Mr. Crerar,
ex-leader of the Progressives, who is just as
st.rongly in favour of the T.reaty as the bonourable gentleman is opposed to it, has given very
good, reasons to show that -it shou1d not hurt
the farmers. Now, how are laymen Vo know
which is rigbt? Perliaps the honourable gentleman from Bedfford can tell us #hy Mr.
Crerar takes one view and lie has taken, the
opposite?
Hon. Mr. POPE: I can tell you one reason,
il ylou would, like to have it.
Hon. Mr. CAjSGRAIN: Yes.
Hon. Mr,. POPE: Mr. Crerar does nlot own
a farm and neyer did; I have always owned
a farm and do now. That is thse diifferente. I
arn noV a, political machine.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Then the next question is this-and I think it also arises out of
Mr. Crerar's speech. He says that Canadian
cheese bas to compete wi-th Australian cheese
in England, and lias eornpeted suceessiully, too,
for years. Now, if we can compete, with Australian cbeese in Englanil, surely we ought
to be able to eomipete witli it in Canada, when
we do noV have Vo pay tlie freigbt that is payable on cheese shipped Vo 'Bngland.
-Hon. Mr. POPE: Can the honourable gentleman give me any Teason why we sbould
compete in thse liome market? Do you not

Hon. Mr. POPE: Aboilt as mucis a far'mer
as hie was a blacksmith.
Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: Honourable gentlemen, I do noV Vhink I cari be accused of
speaking too frequently or .aking up too mucli
time in Vhis Chamber, but -this question is of
such vital importance ta tise interests of Vise
farming .community, esipecially in tise two
Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, wliere dairymng is carried on to a large extent, that I would
not be doing justice Vo the tillers of the soil
if I did not try to explain ta the honourable
members of this House wlio are not in a position to judge, the situation of -the farmers in
this country to-day.
You have just heard tise bonourable gentleman fromn Bedford (Hon. Mr. Pope) refer to
the number of people wbo have lefV the farina.
That movement is occurring not only in
the Province of Quebec froin which bie coames,
but also in 'the Province of Ontario, and thse
reason is simply that farming bas not paid.
The labour of tise fariner is tise poorest paid
of any in the world to-day. I know of a
farmn witbin four mxiles of tise town in which
1 live that was sold lasV week for less money
than it would cost Vo build a house on it;
and it is a good farin, tao, That illustrates
the situation of Vise farmer. He lias lad
saine very bard problems Vo meet, of recent
years, particularly since Vise war.
Let us consider for a moment what the
use of motor cars and trucks and the consumption of gasýoline h~ave memnt Vo the
farmer in this country. Motor cars have
simply put the borses out of commission.
Tliere is no demand to-day for horses. Tise
business road-horse bas gone; tise doctor's
horse bas gone; tise mail carrier's horse bas
gone. To-day the farmer bas Vo seIl bis surplus bay for whatever bie can get for it, and
if lie is practical hie will endeavour Vo feed
iV out at a profit. Tise fact that very few
heorses are used in the city, and that mater
trucks a.nd gasoline are used deprives Vise
farmer of a market for bis bay.
The honourable member spoke of the sbeep
trade. Many of you, lionourable gentlemen,

country at a time when butter production
here is at the maximum cost. In Australia
they have no buildings to construct. You
know that all the shelter given to cows in
Australia is a rubber blanket used for about
thirty days in the fall of the year. You could
buy a good many rubber blankets in Canada
for the money it would cost to construct a
modern barn. As the honourable gentleman
from Bedford (Hon. Mr. Pope) bas said, ws
have encouraged young men to take up farmiing, and officials are sent out through the
country to teach people how to farm. and
now you purpose by this Treaty throwing
open the Canadian market to commodities
of the same kind as we ourselves produce. I
fear there is some big interest concerned in
this Treaty, and that the farmer bas not been
consulted with regard to it.
The situation of the farmer is very pitiable
It is almost impossible for him to make ends
meet. Taxes are high, and he must pay bis
share of them. Therefore I have a great deal
of sympathy for the man who bas brought
Canadian :products to the position they occupy in the world market to-day.
Let me speak for a few moments about the
quality of the cheese manufactured in Canada.
It is the best that is made anywhere in the
known world.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Then we need net
fear competition.
Hon. Mr. WEBSTER: How did the Australian Government introduce the mamifacture
of cheese in that country? They sent to
Canada and hired an instructor named Singleton, from the county which I represent. He
was brought over to Australia. and they introduced modern methods and machinery. Today they are making a very fair grade of
cheese. While J do not think it is equal
to Canadian cheese, this country ought not
to be exposed to the competition from Australian cheese in our home market. We are
quite prepared to meet Australia in the British
market. because Canadian cheese is to-day
worth from one shilling to two shillings and
sixpence per hundredweig.t more tlhan the
cheese of Australia or New Zealand.
With regard to the butter industry, I am
pleased to say that the Province of Alberta
is making possibly the best butter in Canada,
gon. Mr. WEBSTER.

but it will have to compete in the Province
of British Columabia with butter manufactured
in Australia. It costs the Alberta farmer at
least 50 per cent more to make butter than
it costs the Australian farmer. Is that fair
competition? I claim it is not.
Take frozen mutton. When frozen mutton
was admitted into Canada from Australia.
the farmers of this country sold their lambs
at from $1.50 to $2 a head. To-day, for a
sixty-pound lamb you can get $10. That is
the result of keeping that kind of product
out of Canada.
If we continue to open up the markets of
Canada to the world, what will be the result?
As the honourable gentleman from Bedford
bas said, you will simply ýput the farmer out
of business.
Take the sheep industry. When mutton
was admitted free into this country, there
were no sheep worth speaking about in the
Province of Ontario; but now the farmer of
this country is produding the Ibest sheep
that can be found anywhere on the continent
of America. If you want proof of this statement, I would recommend that you inquire
as to where the prizes at the great International Stock Show in Chicago went in the
A man named McEwen
last three years.
and bis son have walked away with the best
prizes offered in Chicago for sheep.
Now, with all this first-class stock, what is
going to be the result if you deprive the
farmers of a market? What is going to be
the effect? I would like to sec this Treaty
go through in some such reasonable form as
was suggested by the honourable gentleman
from Wentworth (Hon. Mr. Smith), but I
amr not prepared to sacrifice the basic industry
of Canada to make a gain of $7,500,000 in a
business that is to-day controlled by the big
interests of Canada.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable gentlemen, there are very few, if any, agreements
submitted to this House which are as difficult
to judge and which may be as weighty in
their consequences as this one. When we
have before us a Private Bill concerning the
interests of two citizens of the Dominion, our
prudence requires us to send the Bill to a
committee whbere both interested parties may
be heard. We sit as a tribunal and, with the
benefit of the knowledge we have obtained,
we make a decision to the best of our ability.
But here is an agreement that is brought
to us during the last hours of the Session.
It interests practically all of the citizens of
Canada. Are we asking that any of those
citizens be heard? No, we are not. As a
consequence, large classes of our population

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Do not forget that
while we export $600,000,000 of natural
products, we import 300,000,000 worth, and it
stands to reason that if we did not import
those $300,000,000 worth, our farmers would
place their goods in our markets to that
extent. Whatever cheese is imported from
Australia will -displace Canadian cheese. But
there again I may be wrong; I do not kinow
the cheese business; but, honourable gentlemen, it is my duty and my business to know
what the experts may say in regard to that
matter.
I stand here in the position of a jury: I
have to judge; to judge I must know; to
know I must have evidence. And I have no
evidence at all. The coinsequence is that if
this House waýnts to abdicate completely, to set
aside its own judgment and to accept as the
law of God what is brought down by the
Government, then it might very well follow
the procedure suggested. If, on the other
hand, we think that we stand in a position of
trust and have to protect the respectable
interests of this country, whatever they may
be, and have to use our own judgment in the
light of our own knowledge, as far as we have
it, then I suggest that when a contract as
important as this one cornes before us we
should refer it to a Committee. Why not ask
experts in every line affected by the Treaty
to come before us and to let us have the
benefit of their knowledge?
Is there any
excuse for not doing that? I am not going
to take the responsibility of voting blindfold
against this measure; neither am I going to
take the responsibility of voting for it; because,
forsooth, I cannot appreciate it at all. If I
can get someone to support me, I will ask
that this measure be sent to a committee
where we will get the knowledge that we
now lack-a knowledge that will place us in
a position to give a judgment based on facts
and experience.
Hon. GEORGE GORDON:
Honourable
gentlemen, the passage of this Bill will
accomplish one important objeet that a good
many of us have been desiring for a long
time, narnely, freer trade within the Empire.
That means that business will be unshackled
within the Empire. If I believed, as some
of my colleagues do, that this agreement
would hurt the farming industry in the way
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

that they have described. I would consider
it my duty to vote against the Bill. But
my opinion is that we have nothing to fear
from Australia so far as butter and cheese
are coneerned. I believe they will find their
way to the mother country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

As usual.

Hon. Mr. GORDON: Yes.
We have heard a good deal of the dark
side this afternoon, and I would like to say
something of the brighter side-the things
that we may expect from this Treaty. Something has been said here this afternoon
belittling the paper trade. The paper trade
is one which, as we know, was started in
Canada only a comparatively short time ago,
but which has grown to be an immense business employing many men. To-day Canada
is suffering from lack of employment, and I
believe that if this Treaty is ratified it will
have the effect of creating more employment
throughout the country. Previous to 1920,
before there was a tariff against us, considerable
of our
paper was going to
Australia.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
year.

$6,000,000 in one

Hon. Mr. GORDON: But since that time
Australia put a duty on paper of 315 ai
ton, which made it impossible to send our
paper into that country. I tbink there is a
potential market there of 100.000 tons. and
people who should know believe that we
could put into that market at least 40.000
tons of paper. 40,000 tons at present prices
would amount to nearly £3,000.000, ail of
wh ich would be spent within the country.
But there is more involved than that.
To-day on the Pacifie coast. where we have
millions of cords of undeveloped pulpwood,
there are people who are endeavouring to
build up an industry, and about the only
markets that they can look to with anv hope
of success are those of the Orient and
Australia. If they can succeed in getting even
30.000 or 40,000 tons more of paper into
Australia, a mill with a production of. I
should say, not less than 12.5 tons per day
would be necessary. That would mean the
employment of anywhere from 2,000 to 2.500
men.
So, after weighing these considerations
against the small quantity of imports which
would come from Australia even under these
reduced duties. it appears to me tfhat the
balance would be in our favour. In all trades
we are looking to get the best end of the
stick, and nobody wants to give away everything. My humble opinion of this Tteaty

JUNE 25, 1925
is that it is a fa.irly good one for Canada,
and I would be quite sorry te see it interfered with.
May I ask the
Han. Mr. McLENNAN:
honourable gentletmani if Australia has consented to the ternis of the Treaty?
Hon. Mr. DANDIJRAND: I have not before me the officiai. correspondence between
the two Governments, but I assume that the
Australian Goverument lias indicated its consent ta the Canadian Governinent, else we
would not have this proposition before us.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: 0f course, the
honourable gentleman recognizes the great
difference ini discus.sing a matter if it lis merely
a -tentative arrangement that can be rnodified
in any respect, or one that lias been practically
arranged subject ta the ratification of Parliament.
Hon. M.r. DANTURAND: I understand
that it lias been agreed ta; so we must ýtake
it as it is.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Has the honourable gentleman any answer to my question as
ta the bonus on cattie from Australia-$2.90
per head?
Hon, Mr. DANDURAND: Australian cattde are not includedý in this Treaty at aIl.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: You have meat.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is dead meat.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Honourable gentlemen, I
have always advocated a home market for al
manufactured prodiicts. I wish ta be logical,
and if I saw that this Treaty would deprive
our fanmers of that home market, or seriously
affect their interests, I would vote gaainst it;
but I ara not so convinced, and I arn taking
the position of the honourable member for
Montarvilýle MHon. Mr. Beaubiiien), that I want
more information before I vote one way or theother.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Might 1 inquire
from my honourable friend what is the intent
of clause 7? I realîze that we are nat in Coinmittee, but we miglit clear this up. That
clause reads:
7. The operation of ail laws inconsistent with the
giving to the provisions of the said agreement and of
this Act their fulil effect shall f rom time to time be
suspended to the extent of such imeonsistency.

I would. point out to my honou-rable friend
that in Canadia we have a sales tax af 5 per
cent an many articles mentioned in this
Treaty. Does this clause inean that the sales
tax is not 'ta apply ta those imtports, and that
therefore the Australian producer shaîl be protected from the sales tax, ta which the manu-

711

facturer or producer of articles are subi eot,
over and above the preference given ta him in
the Canaýdian market?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This is a clause
whîch. the Department of Justice suggested
should be mnserted in ail these agreements, biecause of unforeseen circunistances 'that znay
arise and wauld need action under such power
as is vested in the (4avernar in Council. The
ad.vice of the Departrnent af Justice was that
alil these Treaties sliauld contain sucli a clause,
sa 'that if any impediment arase it ould be
remaved by Order in Council.
Hon. M.r. ROBERTSON: To illustrate
what I have in mmnd, I take diried raisins,
which, under the schedùle propased in this
Treaty, are miade free. This section ad the
Act pravides that the operatian ai ail lsaws inconsistent with the provisions af the Treaty
shal bie suspended. That -clause would suggest, ta a layman like myself, that any laws
inconsistent with the bringing in af raisins free
f rom Australia would have ta lie set aside, and
therefoire the sales tax of 5 per cent would nat
appîy ta raisins imported framn Australia; but
if the -raisins came frani any other country in
the world ta which the sales tax did apply,
then it would have ta 'le colleoted. In other
words, this Treaty would give the Australian a
5 per cent protection against alI athers in that
article, as it cames in free. That is the
thouýglt I have in mind. 1 wan't ta lie dean,
because if that is the case, the Treaty is quite
unfair in that respect.
Hon. Mr. DANIDURAND: I am informed
that those importations will be liable ta the
sales tax, like ail othens. Schedule II says:
Stibject to the provisions of The Customs Tariff, 1907,
there may be granted rto the undermentianed goods the
prodýuce or mianufacture of Australia when hnported
direct into Canada, the rates of customs duty hereinafter set out.

0f course, we have increased the duty on
raisins, and by ýthis Act we are making them
free for Au6tralia, sa that we wiil be able ta
imiport its raisins and dried curnants free under
that schedule.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The result of
the change, as I understand it, would lie that
whereas heretof are there lias heen a duty an
raisins, no matter from wliat country they
came, now it is praposed that they shahl came
in free from Australia.

Hon. Mr. REID:

It is in all of them?

Hon. Mr. DANDUJRAND:
There is a
certainty as to the other Treaties, and probably in the French Treaty as well.
Hon. Mr. REID: I would like to be sure
on that point before the Bill gocs through;
because this Treaty states that the agreement
is entered into between the two countries. and
that the rates of duty specified in the enumerated list shall apply. Now, is there any question about that being understood in Australia
as it has been interpreted by the honourable
leader just now? Unless the Australian Government thoroughly understand the situation,
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

they might take this position: "We made an
agreement that those goods should go into
Canada at a certain rate of duty, and here is
clause 7, put in there specially so that we
would be exempted from that sales tax; but
if you are going to put on a sales tax,
of course that would be a duty against the
goods, whereas in our own country there is
no sales tax when we are selling."
Hon. Mr. SMITH: There is a sales tax on
what is manufactured here.
Hon. Mr. REID: But I 'am talking about
farm products. The people in Australia believe that those articles are coming to Canada
free of duty-that there is no tax whatever
against them. But when the customs entry
is made out they find several headingsBritish preference, intermediate, free, and then
sales tax. So far as I can sec there is really
a tax of 5 per cent being collected. and I
would like to know if there is a distinct understanding with Australia that when an entry
is made out to Australian goods coming into
Canada the sales tax must be paid on those
goods even though they are marked free. as
well as on dutiable goods. Let us have that
thoroighly understood. so that if there is any
question raised in future by those who are
importing we will have on record here the
ground on which this Treaty was passed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am in a poîtion to state that there is no question about
our right, under this Treaty, to collect the
sales tax; and Australia has the same right
in regard to our goods imported into that
country.
Hon. Mr. REID: Of course, if either country could in an indirect way destroy the Treaty
by doing thatHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Not after it is
made.
Hon. Mr. REID: Certainly Australia might
increase its sale tax on some of our goods to
25 per cent, which would destroy the Treaty
so far as we are concerned, and ve could do
the same.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: This schedule is subject to the customs tariff of 1907.
Hon. Mr. REID: But the other clause does
not say customs: it says "all laws." Take
canned goods, on which there is a sales tas
the importer or someone has to pay that sales
tax; but if the law can be interpreted as imposing no sales tax on manufactured goods or
canned goods coming from Australia, the
Canadian manufacturer of the same class of
goods pays 5 or 6 per cent.

7E~

JUNE 25, 1925
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Clause 7 cannot
apply at ail to that condition of things. The
sales Vax is absolutely independent of the
operation of this clause, which is simply for
administrative purposes.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Can my honourable friend answer the further question, as to
whether the Australian Government so understands the terms of the Treaty?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have flot the
correspondence -yefore me; but this is a domestic matter which belonýgs fully to Canada.
Australia will interpret the Treaty under its
laws, while we interpret the Treaty under our
laws.
Hon. Mr. REID: Between now and 8
o'rclàck the honourable leader can get this information f.or me. What he states now is that
the Australien Government will take this
Treaty as we pass it, and they will of course
interpret it as they please. But I should liko,
Vo ask: was this Treaty as it is now before
us, word for word given Vo the Australian
Government, and did the Minister who negotiated this Treaty state to that Government
or its representative that, notwithstanding
th-at we are allowing these goods in at the
rates of duty specified, we have in -our country
a sales Vax which they have not, and there
will be a charge of the sales tax on ail those
goods, whatever it is, whether 5 or 6 per cent,
s0 th-at the Australian representatives must
understand that so long as we have th-at sales
tax it will be collected by the customs officiais
when their goods corne intVo this country?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There are general rules that govern such Treaty arrangments between nations. I might instance the
Treaty of 1907 Vo illustrate what has developcd
under it. A Treaty was signed in Paris by
Vhe Right Hon. Mr. Fielding and the Hoa.
Mr. Brodeur for Canada and by representaives of the French Republic. IV was submitted
to for Parliament at the same time as it was
submitVed to the House of Assembly in Paris.
It passed the House of Assembly in Paris and
the two 'branches of the Canadian Parliament;
but it was suspended in the French Senate
and was sent Vo the Commission des Douanes
-Vue Customs Committee of the Senate-and
examined very minutely. The matter was
postponed from one session to the nexV, and in
the interval the Committee of the French
Senate had Vhe advantage of reading the discussion that had taken place in our Canadian
House of Commons, where there had been
some very close questioning by- some members regarding the interpretation of each clause.
The Canadian delegates had answered in all

loyalty and sincerity, stating what Vhey bebe
_ieved Vo, the true interpretation Vo be given
Vo the variou8 clauses of the Treaty. The
CommitVee of the Senate of France discussed
our interpretation and differed on three or
four points. Some of these points were maVerial. I had occasion Vo return Vo Paris with
Mr. Fielding, and for a month we discussed
the question of interpretation. The Minister
of Commerce obtaincd from the C-ommitVee
of the French Senate its objections Vo our
interpretation, and we endeavoured Vo reconcile the different, views regarding the
v*arious clauses. We dlid so mainly Vhrough
an exchange of letters, in which we agreed as
Vo what the interpretation should be.
A Treaty with any country may give rise
Vo a divergence of opinion as Vo Vhe interpretation. Sometimes this dýifference will occur
only in the application of the TreaVy, and only
after it has been in force many months or
years. But my honourable friend surely does
noV expect that there will be correspondence relating the conversations that Vook place. Each
country discusses its affairs, an agreement is
arrived at, and Vhen it is applied according Vo
the iaws of the country. If there is afterward
some recrimination in the application of Vhe
Treaty, the diffiulty is ironed out in some
way, or, if there îs no way of adjusting it,
the Treaty is abrogated.

I quite believe that in bis heart my honourable friend fes that he bas been used for a

to lay tbis measure before us as be bas done.
Wben tbe old draft was brougbt Up, I was
disposed -to favour tbe Treaty, so far as 1 bad

measure shows such meagre and povertystricken provisions for Canada tbat it is veýry
difflicult for me to keep up sympatby with tbe

always wanted ýa Treaty witb Australie. Sbe
was the only one of the British countries with
whieh we bad nlot preferential relations. Many

knows, but tbey ail bave failed up to the
present time, for various reasons. Tbe bonourable leader of the Government, (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) was good enough to mention my
name in tbe memorandum wbich be read, and
which had been prepared for him, but I do not
think he gave me as mucb credit as I sbould

Mr. Fisher was tben tjhe Prime Minister, and

Under the, agreement tbat we arranged at

unfortunate things .that take plwce da ail countrieâ, and wbi.cb sometimes have un-expected

from looking j-to !this matter tbat tbey had
taken that ýmethod. Whist ýmy bonourable
frienýd from Wentworth (Hon. Mr. Smitb)
said, and wbat bas been repeated by otbers,
is an absoluteiy reasonýable proposition. There
are two ways in wbicb yoýu can give a preference. There is no need for me to repeait what
t.he bonourable member from Wentworth s0 exceUlently and forcibly said. Tbe preference
which is now given to Australia could bave
been given, on the comparative basis if the
Government had taken the senýsible course of
raising somewhat the line of duties tapon agricultural artileis. They bad every excuse and
every reason for .doisg that, because ýaiong our
whole border we are at a disadvan-taýge in the
interchange of agricultural icommodities in

low tariff against competition from outside.
If tbe Government bcd carried out tbat prînciple they .could have had an aqually good
preferenice, and they coul'd bave given a fair

Australians and negotîate a treaty because of
the fact that tbeýir produets are so Largely tbe
products that we ourselýves raise, and that if
youi take a series of yeairs t.hey confront you
with a very plain proposition. Tbey say, "We
buy from you four or five or six or seven times
as muich as you buy from us," and they say
that tbe opportiunities for their competition in
this market are not so great by fer as our opportunities in their market. Tbýey put that
proposition very strongly, and it imakes ne-otiation difficult. At the same time, there is a
pretty strong sentiment in Australia in favour

Hon. A. B. GIILLIS: Honaurable gentlemen,
ooming as I do from. a part of the West where
we are entirely dependent aipon what às known
as the small farmer, I wish to express my disapproval af this Bill. It seems ta me that in
Ohis Treaty the dice are loaded in favaur of
Australia. Austraýlia does flot produce pulpwood or paper, and consequently is not making
any sacrifice in that regard. On the otiher
hand, *we -are graniting Australia the freedom
of aur markets with regard ta ýail the oommodities thýat the small farmer of eastern
Saskatchewan depends upon for his existence.
I fail to see why the Government shou.ld sacrifice the farming interest of this -country for a
oamparatively few advantages an the part of
wh'at rnay be termed the big interests. The
Conservative Party bas been acoused by the
Western press and others of being associated
or connected with what are known -as the big
interests. This is the sang that lias been sung
for 25 ýor 30 years in the West. There is no
foundation for that staternent; but now we
can reverse conditions and say that the Liberal
Party 'have associated themselves witih the
big interests and have sacrifieced the interests of the farmers of Canada.
I live in a cornmunity in eastern Sashatolhewan which is carrying on mixed farming.
What haippens is t-his. The farmers put in
their cropo, and, if they are fortunate en.ough
ta ;get a good harvest they -are able ta meet
their obligations and -have probably enaugh
money ta tide tbem over ta the next spring.
When spring cornes they depend upon their
poultry and Their dairying and tiheir cattle for
existence until the next harvest. If this Treaty
gaes inta effect what is the result? Just before I carne away the farmers were receiving
15 cents a dozen for eggs and 20 cents for
butter; but if this Treaty with Australia goes

it is unreasonable and unfair that 75 per cent
o-f the people of this country sbould be sacrificed for tfhe purpose of giving a few pullpmilling concerns the freedorn of the Australian
market.
Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: Honourahle gentlemen, I have been unable to follow this debate,
and I must confess that I was quite uncertain
as to whether I wouýld ibe justified in voting

Honourable
Hon. Mr. D ANDURA'ND:
gentlemen, we know that repeated efforts
hiave been made during the l'mst thirtyvyears
to reach a certain agreement with Ausqtralia.
Thro right honourable gentleman from Ottawa
(Right Hon. Sir George E. Fozter) h'ms told
us of bis own pilgrimmge to Moîbouirne. and
of his attempt to bring b'mck to Canada a
satisfactorv arrangement.
Ho has well said
that when we sit around the table with
Austrahiagn dolegates we are handicapped by
the condition of our present exohange. We
are selling- to themn $12.000,COO worth, and
they are selling to us over $2,000,000 worth.
But wben we look at the value of the Austrahian mnarket, of its purchases and its imports,
w-e flnd that there it offers a fair field for
Canadian development and expansion.
The honourable gentlemen who interest
themselves more especiallvy in farming and

happen under this arrangement. Well, they
must rely upon the study that has been made
by the officers of the various Departments.
The Minister of Finance bas flot signed this
agreernent witbout availing himself of the
proper advice a.nd counsel. Ho has cunsulted
the dairy industry and the people who are
rnostly interested in supervising the administration of the Departrnent of Agriculture.
For instance, hoe finds that cheese and butter
iaroduced in Australia are mainly sold in the
British market, wbere the pi'ice is fixed, and
that'there is very little danger of cheese and
butter fromn Australia reaching our shores to
any extent. As the righit bonourable gentleman bas said, the trade of Au. 0tralia is towards Great Britain. I may mention the fact
that the total exports of butter frorn Australia
for 1922-23 were 79.000,000 poumis. of xvhich
70.000,000 pounds went to Great Britain.
The total exporta of cheese' from Australim
were 5,450,466 pounds, while our exporcs were
126,963,200 pounds. 'Surely in such a situation there is no danger to our cheese indiustry.
We have givon Australia a large benefit in
the sale of its raisins, of which we produce
none in Canada,
We bad to flnd snme
article that would bo acceptable, and would

we rai.sed the tariff to 3 cents on raisins in

On section 3-rates of duties on Australian
goods imported direct:
Hon. Mr. REID: I just want to enter my
protest with reference to this Treaty. I do
not like to give a silent vote. My reasons
are, first, as I have stated in regard to other
Bills, that I really think it has been very
unfair to bring this Bill here within, as we
might say, 48 hours of prorogation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend from Ottawa said so a moment ago.
Hon. Mr. REID: I know he did, but I
want to say so. too, because that is one of
my reasons. Look at the opportunity we
would have had of getting information, and
learning whether we were doing right so far
as our own country is concerned. Surely
the honourable leader of the Government
cannot say that it is fair treatment. I mention it now, and will do so on every Bill if
this practice continues after we have lost so
much time during the Session. In regard to
this Treaty, I am not in favour of it, as I
believe it is not in the interest of the farmers
of this country. I think it may injure them,
and do an injustice, and I think it will be
one of the greatest means of preventing immigration. Having entered my protest, my
voting against the Bill may be interpreted as
voting against the interest of trade within
the British Empire. However, I do not think
that counts for anything; I think we should
look after our own interest first, and then
try to develop the other.
Section 3 was agreed to.
Sections 4, 5 and 6 were agreed to.

Provided further that any of the goods above

of Australia imiported direct into Canada shall be
entitled to the benefit of any reduction in duties or
preference granted in respect of like goods imported
from any British country.

Hon. Mr. REID: No, I will read clause
7 first. I interpret that clause to mean that
goods from Australia coming into Canada free
of duty shall still be subject to a sales tax.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend should read the introduction to Schedule
H.
Hon. Mr. REID: That is all right. Then
let us take the first item: "Meats, fresh, j

tariff would be; but the Australian says: "You

the operation of all laws inconsistent with this

in any other way.

SENATE

The Shepparton Preserving Co. have 70,000 cases,
and the Government Pool of last year 210,000 cases
Iving in London unsold. It is proposed by this year's
Pool Commission to pack 550,000 cases, and more this
year-

That is, 1924-- and in view of the stocks lying in England it is
itended that the Australian market shahl absorb fully
90 per cent of this quantity, in face of last year's conŽuiption of 125,000 cases.
Australia is to be asked then to consume four and
half times what she has ever dona before, and as all
ihe propaganda in the world will not acomplish this
àn one year in view of the prices asked, it would
app
iear sound policy on the part of the Government
to make strenuous efforts to clear the stocks lying in
England in order to make room for further export
quantities, unless, of coúrse, they wish tn be saddled
with a heavy carry-over at the end of the year's
operations for an indefinite period.
Piease note there is no limitation put on the life of
this Pool C->mmission, which bas been formed to dispose of this year's pack, and if it takes three years
to sell the stocks they carry on for that time. As they
fomrm themoselves into a company they naturally have
fiil power of attorney to act as they see fit, without
fear of interference from Government circles.
To consuie the 550,000 cases of fruits in Australia, a
first essental would be a cheap popular price of 1/
per tin, but unfortunately the prices named by the
Pool makes it impossible for the retailer taking a
3
oirmal profit to seli apricots under 1/ , peaches under
1/4, and pears 1/6 per tin.
Grading.-As it is claied by the canners that the
Australian public will not pay an extra price for fancy
and choice grades of canned fruits above tihe price asked
for the lower standard grade it has been decided that
nearly all the fruit packed this year shall go under
the standard grades.

Hon. Mr. REID: And the freight from
Australia to this country is less than on our
own goods.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: It is less than the
freight to England. They would have an
advantage in coming into this market.
Hon. Mr. REID: But if you ship west to
Calgary, the freight from your place is more
than the freight from Australia.

shail not apply to:
(a) Intoxicating liquor which bas been purchased by
or on behalf of, and which is consigned to His Majesty
or the Executive Government of the province into
which it is being imported, sent, taken, or transported;
or any board, commission, officer or other governmental agency which, by the laws of the province, is
vested with the right of selling intoxicating liquors; or,
(b) The carriage or transportation of intoxicating
liquor into and through a province by means only of
a common carrier by water or by railway, if, during the
time the intoxicating liquor is being so carried, or transported, the package or vessel containing the intoxicating liquor is not opened or broken or any of the intoxicating liquor drunk or used therefrom; or,

This is to allow of the free passage of liquoi
through a province having prohibition laws.
(c) The importation of intoxicating liquor into e
province by any person duly licensed by the Government of Canada to carry on the business or trade et
a distiller or brewer where the intoxicating liquor sc
imported is imported solely for the purpose of being
used for blending with or flavouring the products of
the business or trade of a distiller or brewer carried
on by him in the province, and while kept by him in
the province is kept in a place or warehouse which

law governing such places or warehouses, and is used

bis said business or trade as a distiller or brewer.
(d) The importation into a province of any intoxicating liquor for sacramental or medicinal purposes
or for manufacturing or commercial purposes, other
than for the manufacture or use thereof as a beverage.

So far this amendment is an exact reproduction of the Bill that was before us at two
Sessions. There is a clause concerning the
burden of proof:
(3) The burden of proving the right to import intoxicating liquor, or to cause intoxicating liquor te be
imported, or te send, take or transport intoxicating
liquor, or to cause intoxicating liquor to be sent, taken
or transported into any province shall be on the
person accused.

Provision is made for penalties for violation,
first offence, and subsequent offences:

importation of intoxicating liquors into the province
has net been prohibited under Part IV. of this Act,
and in which there is, at any time, in force a law
vesting in His Majesty or the Executive Government
of the province authority for the control and sale of
intoxicating liquor in the province, or in any board,
commission, officer or other governmental agency the
right of selling intoxicating liquor in the province,
requesting that the prohibitions contained in subsection
one of this section be brought into force in that
province, the Governor in Council may, by proclamation published in the Canada Gazette, declare the
prohibitions of subsection one of this section in force
in that province and the same shall thereupon be and
continue in force therein.
(6) Upon receipt by the Secretary of State of Canada
of a duly certified copy of an order in couneil of the
Lieutenant-Governor in Council of any province, in
which the prohibitions of subsection one of this section
are in force, requesting that the said prohibitions be
revoked, the Governor in Council may by proclamation
published in the Canada Gazette declare that the pro-

hibitions of subsection one of this section shall ne longer
be in force in that province and the same shal thereupon cease te be in force therein.

The objiect of this Bill is mainly to prevent
the operations of the export houses and 'to recognize and accept the sovereignty of a province within its own borders. When a province
has decided upon a certain regime to govern
its inhabitants, the Federal power comes in
to help it te carry out its will.
I might dilate upon the principle and the
operation of this measure all night long without giving any more information than is contained in the Bill. We are all aware of its
purpose. The Province of British Columbia is
urging the Department of Justice to submit
this legislation de novo. I am informed that
the Province of Quebec, whose statutory enaetment and organization are similar to those of
British Columbia, is also asking the Federal
Government for this legislation.
Hon. J. D. REID: Honourable gentlemen,
as the honourable leader of the Government
has said, this is exactly the same Bill that was
before this House on two former occasions. It
was thoroughly discussed each time, and, as
we all remember, it was defeated. Of course,
I raise the same objection to proceeding with
this Bill that I did with regard to others at
this late date in the Session. But I have a
further objection which I think justifies our
re'fusing to proceed with it. The honourable
gentleman knows that aIl the members from
British Colunbia have left within the last few
days. They had to get their reservations several days ahead, and it was expected that
Parliament would prorogue to-day. This Bill
does not reach us until after they have left for
home, and now we are expected to rush it
through. I think it is most unfair to ask us
to proceed with it. Furthemore, there have
been some changes in temiperance legislation in
Canada. We ought to have time to examine
all the legislation, to see Vyhether we are justified in passing it or not. In view of the fact
that the Senate bas twice defeated' this Bill,
and that the representatives of the Provinces
most interested are not here to-night te speak
on this question, I think we ought not to allow
the Bill te pass, but should let it stand till
next Session. It can be taken up on the firet
day of next Session, or within a few d'ays
after the opening of Parliament, when all the
members are present, and it will thén have a
fair chance.
For the reasons I have given, I move:
That this Bill be net now read a second time, but
but that it be read a second time this day six months.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: I
have listened to the reasons given by my
honourable friend for the 'rejection of this

Bill, and I amn free to say that 1 cannot agree
witli a single one of them. Lt is quite true
that this Bill, as other Bis, lias been brouglit

it is aise true fliat other Bis have been taken

that we sliould nlot proceed witli tLi'ý Bill
because the members for Britisli Columbia
are flot here, is an argument whicli I do not
think is founded on either good sense or
logic. Lt is the business of ail mienibers cf
the Senaie frein the Provinces, who are paid
their salary, and a good salary, for attcriding
te their business as ýSenators, te lie here and
to attend ta tliat business. If we are going

JUNE 25, 1925
upon which. ail law is founded, and I defy
anyone to stand up in either House and maintain the argument that you can invite and
help your own citizens to break the law of
a neighbouring country, and do it consistently
and continually, without breaking down the
respect for law in your own country. Law is,
in its essence, and in the moral ba6is upon
which it is founded, the saine in one civilized
Christian country as in another, a.nd anything which incitesl the hreaking of a law
of a neighbouring country is bound, in one
way or another, to inculcate disrespect for
the Iaw in the country which permits the
incitement. In sO far a6 we are preve.nting
the Provinces from carrying out those regulatiens that have a tendenry to stop the breaking of the law in the Province and in the
neighbouring country, we are helping the
disrespect for law and the moral principleý
upon which it is founded.
I just aak myseif what bas been the history
of theÉe expert houseýs in Britishi Columbia
for the last two or three yeareý. I knoiv from
information that I have-aind. I do nlot believe
anyone for a moment will try to dispute that
information-that those expert houses are
the seat of the trouble in that Province;
therefore I amn strongly in favour of putting
into the hands of the Provinces, which after
repeated. efforts have corne ta a certain policy
upon the way ,rn which tbey will carry out
those liquor laws, the means of doing so. 1
think that the Dominion, and that we in the
Senate, ought to interpose no instrument
wbich wiIl prevent them froin carrying out
those laws; on the contrary, I tbink that we
ougbt willingly and cheerfully to aid them
in the efforts which they are making ta that
end.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen,
Iwauld like ta ask the Leader of the Government if it is not a fact tha't none of those
exporting houses in Britishi Columbia can get
a license uniess it has first obtained the consent of the Attorney General of the Province.
That was the law two years ago.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED- It is the
la-w to-dayr.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I confess that
1 have had no time ta look over the reports
of discussions that we have had in this
Chamber, or to get in touch with the Departments that have something to do with the
licenses. As far as my memory carrnes me,
there are certain powers which must be
exercised by the Depariment of Customs,
and I believe that if a request ie made for a
license for an expert warehouse under certain
conditions, it must be granted.
S-46

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Not without the consent of the local Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 0f course, that
was two years ago. But I remember that for
two sessions we grappled with this difficulty,
and finally the mai oity-and it was not ail
on the samne side of the Hlou.se-came to the
conclusion that the Attorney General of the
GoVernment of the day had nat a clear
mandate fromt the people. As far as I refnember, it was upon* that ground. that the
Bill failed ta pass. It was said that there had
been a referendum taken, but that the referendum covered other things. Now matters
have been corrected, the Government that is
puttîng this law inta effeet having been returned ta power. It is there hy the expression
of the will of the majority of the people of
British Columbia, and I cannot understand
how this House could justify itself in refusing
this demand', wbich cornes ta us for the
third time af.ter having passed the House of
Commons.
I confess that when I picked up thîs Bill a
moment ago I felt so discouýraged by the fate
that it bad met in this Chamber two or three
years ago that I said, "This is the saine Bill."
But. in view of the explanation whieh my
right bonourable friend has given, and the
statement made ta me that a corse existed
wbicb cauld be cured if this Bill were passed,
I appeal ta my hanourable friends ta allow
tbe Bill ta pass at this time.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Hlonourable gentlemen,
the hanourable member for Ottawa (Riglit
Hon. Sir George E. ?Foster) lia stated that
the curse of the situation in British Columbia
ie the export house. As I understand it, the
Province of British Columbia bas for years
had that matter entirely in its own hands,
and na lieenzses could be given by the Department here in Ottawa ta an exparting bouse
until the Attorney General of British Columbia
had assented ta the granting of it. Sa far as
that is concerned, and the honourable gentiemarn says it is the crux of the matter, there
does not seemn ta be any necessity for this
Bill at all.
Ther.e is another point ta which I would like
ta refer. At one time tbey had a referendum
in British Columbia, but part of that referendum was on the question of the riglit of
private persans ta import for their own use.
tack of this Bill is a movement on the part
of the British Columbia Government ta take
away hy legisiation what the people got by
a referendam. If they have a referendum in
British Columbia on the question of whether
or flot a private citizen is ta have the right

REVISED EDITIaN

SENATE
to import liquor for his own use, and it is
decided in the negative. that ends it for me:
I have nothing more to say.

I was in British Columbia two years ago,
and I made particular inquiries to find out
what the sentiment there was. and what the
facts were. I was told by somne of the ladies
who head temperance organizations, and
others, that they were flot in favour of this
movement--that it was a movement to turn
the Government of British Columbia into a
grog shop, to enable themn to get the thing
int their own hands, and make money out
of the sale of liquor. More than that, the
principal of the Preshyterian College out there
published a pamphlet on this matter, snying
that the Government there was wrong about
it. and that what the Senate had done was
right. That gentleman lives in the country,
and is a man of repute, and 1 take his statement as practically final in that regard.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I want to put
this proposition to my honourable friend. I
will adjourn the discussion on this Bill for
an hour or two, or untill to-morrowv forenoon,
and if he comes to this Chamber at that time
and tells me that the members for British
Columbia in the other Ibuse are opposed to
this Bill. I will not insist upon it; but if the
members for British Columbia, who represent
two or three of the parties in the other House,
have agreed upon thiq measure. then I will
say that the Senate of Canada bas no rigbt
to balk the wîhl of that Province.

Hon. W. B. ROSS: Ail that means is that
you are going o count heads. The best thing
is to get down to facts and arguments. Is it
a fact that the Government of British Columnhia bas the power to destroy export warebouses?

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
debate wvas adjourncd.
SOLDIER SETTLEMENT BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 208, an Act to amend the
Soldier Settlement Act, 1919.
H.p said: This Bill provides that a 40 per
cent reduction shahl be aiiowed on live stock

purchased prior to t.he lst of October, 1920;
and 20 per cent on live stock purchased after
the lst of October, 1920, and prior to the Ist
of Octoher, 1921.
In the annual report of the Soldier Settiement Board. dated December, 1924, in treating
of the deflation in values, it is stated on
page 8:
The greater number of soldier settlers in Cannal
bouiglt at the peak of war timne prices. Those seho sold
o them rea-ped t.he benefits of the inflated prices, and
the soldier settier now finds the property to bs worth
les than the government charged thema for it; that is,
they have become the victims of the deflation caused
by the afterrnath of the war they had won. For instance, soldier settlers bought in Canada before the
slumip in values live stock te the extent of approximately $13,500,000. To-day that live stock is wor-th lesthsn hait that smnount....
1 zive an extract froma the annual report
of the Soldier Settiement Board:

The survey shows that, while the value of the animais possessed by soidier settlers is less in the aggregate than the previous year, there has been a substantiai increase in the nsimber of miich cows, swine and
pouitry. Soidier Settiement Board supervisors have constantly kept before settiers the importance of
increasing their revenue producing live stock and poultry. The following table shows a comparison of the
number of miich cows, swine and pouitry in possession of 18,598 settiers during the years 1921, 1922 and 1923:Milch Cows

Ho.n. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I do not know
whether the Government has formed any
policy as to whether they will or wilil not have
t
a re-valuation of ·he land.
Hon. M.r. DANDURAND: I cannot answer
ny honourable friend at this moment, but I
will try to obtain the information.
Hon. Mr. POPE: In our country the depreciation of land value is a very serious
question. I know some farms which were
bought for $3,500 and sold for $1,500. I do not
know how many settlers we have, but ýthere
are .two or three near my home, and I know
of only one who has been successful; he had
a brother living near him who gave him practical assistance.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Are there .many
soldier settlers?
Hon. Mr. POPE: Perhaps not more than
ten.
Are they on
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
farms that had been abandoned?
Hon. Mr. POPE: The farms were purchased from occupiers. Of course, the Government inspector looked afiter the valuations,
at the time of pu.rohase, to see that they were
not excessive. The depreciation with us, has
been very serious indeed.

my
Does
Mr. DANDURAND:
Hon.
honourable friend really believe that the
Government should proceed to repay the
amount that has been paid under a contract
by people who have been in a position to pay,
because he wishes to help those who, for one
reason or another, have been less fortunate
than the others? This Bill makes a somewhat
compassionate settlement, and my honourable
friend suggests that those who are fnot in
need should be treated as on an equal footing
with the less fortunate.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: We shall probably
know in a short time the ultimate view of
Parliament on compassionate allowances; but
where you have a number of people who are.
so to speak, wards of the state, and ail
started with a hajndicap, I do think the man
who has been successful should get the full
benefit of his success. The man who has
carried that handicap successfully should not
be left, less well off than the man who broke
down under it.
My honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
friend forgets that there are varying conditions. One settier may have had better land;
another may have had a better crop. It is
very difficult to say, in a general way, "We
will give 40 per cent reduction," when some
are net entitled to it, and those who have
paid have simply caried out their contract.

The price seemed

Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: That is definitely
my opinion, for whatever it is worth.

Hon. Mr. POPE: Well, it was the price
of that day. It was the time of war prices
for agricultural products. A cow was then
worth $125 or $130; to-day she is worth about
$10. The settlers were not allowed to sell
those animals; they were bound to keep them
same low valuation
if they could. The
:applied to ail the animais, and it has been
a serious question.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think it will
be found, on reading the whole section, which
states in part, "or whose agreement with the
Board has net been terminated or rescinded,"
that very few or any of the returned men who
took up land under this scheme have terminated their agreements and made
their
payements in full, because of the fact that the
payments were to run over a long period of
years.

Hon. Mr. WATSON:
fair when they bought?

As I read the
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN:
Act it does not seem to apply to any soldier
settlers who were not in arrears. That seems
to me to be creating an unfair distinction
between the man who, through saving or being
thriftier than his neighbours, has paid up ail
to the
the obligations he has undertaken
Government, and who got his cattle, etc., at
high prices in 1920, and yet carried on and has
made a success-and a great many I understand have done that-and the man who has
been less successful in returns, but who will
get a very material benefit. It is a question
whether the farmer should not be as well
treated as the man who has not done as well,
and has net met his obligations.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. McLENNAN:
But have not a
good many been terminated by men abandoning the farm, having proved unseuccessful for
one reason or another?
I think it is
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
intended that ail, or nearly all, of the soldier
settlers who are still on -the land, and whose
contracts are still unexpired, shall participate

BOARD OF AUDIT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved thé second
reading of Diil 2n3, an Act to constitute a
Board of Audit.
He said: Honourabie gentlemen, the Audit
Board Act of 1923 provided that the Board
shouid cease to function on the ist of Juiy,
192,5.
That Act provided that the Board
shouid consist of four members, the Auditor
General nnd the Deputy Minister of Finance
being two, the other two being cbartered accountants. The present Dili prov-ides that the
memh<'rship shall be not less than three and
not more than fie. One of the members must
be a chartered accountant.

JUNE 25, 1925
The new Board shall act as advisers to the
Treasury Board and on its -instructions shall
investigate:
(a) the sufficiency of the methods of aceounting and
of the procedure in other respects employed in the
conduet of the publie business of Canada or of any
department or detail thereof;
(b) the economies which may bie effected in any of
the public services or in the conduct of the public
business;
(c) the finanicial affaira of the Canadian National
Railway Company and the Canadian Government Merchant Marine, Limited, and any other undertaking
owna-d or carried on by the (3overnment of Canada;
(d) the financial affaira of any commission or other
public body the operations of which are carried on hy
appropriations from the Treasury of Canada, or which
are aided by grants or loans fromn the said treasury.

The members shail hcdld office for a terni
nlot exceeding five years, but sha:h be eligible
for re-appointment.

There are just as good mnen in the service
as can be got outeide. I know of men in the
service that I would not hesitate to put into
a position of this kind, if it is the intention of
adding $3,000 to the salary.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Hlonourable gentlemen, I would like to asic if it is the intention
to pay that 83,000 to the mien named. They
are now getting $15,000 each. There must
be some limit to this piiing up of salaries.

An officer of the public service of Canada shall serve
as a member of the Board without compensation.

Hon. Mr. REID: I interpret that clause to

Right Hon. Sir GfEORiGE E. FOSTER:
Do vou think you could have got a controiler,
with a head who direeted him, who was honest
in the matter of econorny, who wouid have
authorized the spendinýg at Halifax this year
of $1,250.000 or thereabouts for an elevator,
and other sumas for elevators ail over? That
is the kind of thing we want in this country,
and without it you wil1 never get ecunurny,
but rather you wil1 get extravagant expenditure, and multiplication
of servants and
officiais.
We wiii never get at economy
in publie service uniess we have some one
who can go into departmnents and discruss with
the heails of departments and say: "You have
this mnucha appropriation; we think it is flot
necessarv for you ta spend that; show us the
necessity, and if you cannot, it .must be lopped
off." The thing needed is ta get a bod* 0f control which shail prevent unnecessary expendýitures. and we wili never get economy by
simply appointing persons with large staffs ta
examine into matters and add other persons,
and still other persons, the former and the
second of which have flot performed any real
service in the way of economvy. but have been
adding and constantly adding to expense of
administration.

Governments and parties. It is getting very
close to that. and the country ail the time has
to pay the shot; and our country is hurdened;
it is staggserinrg under its load. My honour.able friend knows in his heart that aur country is staggering under its present financial
ioad, under the enormous taxes taken from
the pocket'i of the people, and from the industrial if e of the country. We are starvinz ourselves hy this extraordinary taxation, and driving out of our country people

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, I have listened with considerable
interest ta the disquisition of my right honoura:bie friend on the drawbacks of-democratic
government. Those drawbacks he kinows far
better than I do. He has been at the helm
himself, as ýMinister of Finance. For 30 years
ha dominated the Huse of Commons by his
elloquence, and he continues here, and I hope
that for manv decadeýs ha will ha among us.
Ail that hae haqs paînted ta us aýs being
defects under aur administration he has seen
and feit for over 30 years. But the solution
is so difficuit under aur systemn that he has
done nothing ta mend methods which he
admits ta ha had. although he passled through
a regime during which money was being spent
hy millions and hundreds of millions during
fivi- years of war. We had the open confession of one of his colleagues in this Chansber
that there was an orgy of expenditure-that
people were drunk with expenditure; yet there
was no Board of ýContrai; and why? Because
aur systemn is totaily different from that of
the United States, where there is no ministcrial respansibility. The two Hanses of Parliament thera are without any leader, without
any direction.
The motta used ta be,
"Scratch my back and ll scratch vours,"
when the groups were strug-gling ta get
millions spent in ana state or another. There
was over t'hem only the .threat of the veto
of the Presidant; that was ail. Graduaill
they realized that the Congress of the United
States was a rudderiess boat, and in the face
of the appalling expenditure occa.sioned by
the war they decided tha.t some instrument

*-decided ta put a ootroller between hlm

But how could that system on the othar
sida of the line which my right honourable

JUNE 25, 1925
friend admires furiction here? It could only
function if Parliament decided by an Act
to place at its head a master. Thus far
tlhe administration is in the hands of Ministers, heada of Departments who serutinize,
or are supposed to scrutinize, the Eetimates
that are brouglit to them; and when they
have scrutinized them, those Estimates are
brouglit to Council. That is where the powex
of the Council lies: they examine those Estimates, use the pruning knife to the best of
their ability. When they reach a certain conclusion those Estimates are presented to the
House, and when they pass the two Houses
of Parliament tliey become law. But you
cannot aibridge the powers of the Executive;
ypu cannot put over themn a master, or
paralyze them, or prevent, thema from administering the affairs of the country, and paso
that responsibility to individuals, except by
a law of Parliament.
Now, has my right honourable friend ever
thought for a moment that, dominating the
House of Commons as he did. with his party
and lis friends and his personal influence,
lie could ever bring the House of Convmofis
to pass an Act by which the control of the
expenditure of the whole budget would ire
lifted from the House anid from the Executive,
and passed over to one mari? The President
of the United States does that because he
hs the fulil powere by bis right to, veto.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: He is a dictator.
Yes, he is a
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
dictator; but we are under a totally different
systemn. My right honourable friend realizes
that the system is differenit, because the
President could alter that system, and could
create the Controller, the master, whose name
to-day is General Lloyd.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOTJGHEED: We will
do that bye-and-bye. Now let us get back
to our muttons, so, to speak.
Yes; gettîng
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
back to our own Bill, muddling through our
system, iniperfect as it is, but democratic,
the British systein of Goverrinent, we have
the Audit Act of 1922 before us. The Board
of Audit bas been organized. There are two
or~three memibers of that Board who have
gone on their way, and are working. W2iL
are they doirig? On what have their lab~ours
been e:nerided, and in what departments?
What have they done? 1 canriot tell my
rîght honourable friend now; I can perhaps
do so to-morrow; btit I cari tell him of the
existence of thle Audit Board.
The Auditor General is a new appointee.
He receives $15,000 becsiuse he would not

731

come, and no orne of his class would come,
under that sum. It is a small sum, compared
to the salaries of dozens of men wbom I
know of ini niy own city, who have far les
responsibility than that of the 'Auditor
Gerieral of Canada, but a much larger salary.
He lias to apply the Audit Act of Canada.
He does so, and sirice lie came lie saved the
very increase that we gave himn, simply in
the form of printing the last Auditor Geriexal's Report. My riglit honourable friend,
wlien he sees that report, will flid that the
increase of safary has been fully earried. I
would riot begrudge the salary if I saw the
Auditor General doing from year to year
things that are effective; but lie has hardly
had time to turn around and organize bis own
office, and put to work bis own staff. I hope
lie will do well; lie is an expert wlio kriows
bis business.
This Audit Board lias far wider pyowers, and
I hope that some good will come out of it.

I cannot say, but I know it is in existence.

this moment this Board is practically the only
real hope we have that there will be ecoioqmies

wi.h real work, save bimdreds of thousands of
dollars. I sug'gest that we do not stop this
work. We do not know what the Board bas
done, but I ask that we take the second reading of this Bill.
Hon. Mr. REID: This Bill contains clauses
that I cerýtainly could not spprove of. Both
Houses of Parliament have passed a law providing that no civil servant can lie appointed
except by the Civil Service Commission. We
carnot appoint the Gentleman Usher of the
Black Rod. Even the Auditor General's Department to-day carinot employ skilled men
of ariv kind, or any employee, except through
the Civil Service Commission; but now we
are constitutirig a Board, and givirig it authority to appoirit ail the employees tliey wish,
and the Civil Service Commission lias nothing
wliatever to do with the appointment. Is that
riglit?
By clause 3 we give this Board large powers,
and I agree with wliat .has been said by other
lionourable members, that tbey will bave a
great big staff. But for -this Board the Civil
Service Commission are not qualifled to make
appoiit-ments. The -clause says:
The Board mnay, with the approval of the Treaaury
Board, engage from time to tirae such skilled assistance
as may be required-

SENATE

732

Everyone will be a skilled assitant; that is
the 'vay they will d'o without the Civil Sexrvice Commission. It goes on:
to conduct or facilitate the inquiries to bie made by
the Board, and sucli compensation shaIh be paid for
,,uclh skilled assistance as the Treasury Board shall
allow. Sueli clerical assistance as snay bie niecessary for
the purposes of the Board, inc!uding the services of a
rompetent person to perforai the duties of a Secretary
to the Board, shall 'le supplied from time ta time as
the Treasury Board may direct.

Now, I ask honourable gentlemen if it is
fair that any Department or Commission such
as the Board of Railway Gommissioners or the
Pensions Commissioners should appoint its
secretary when the Civil Service Commission
only have power to roake ail such appointments? I think that is an objectionable
clause. If the Civil Service Act is good this
clause should not be in this Bill, or else the
Civil Service Commission should be abolished.
This Bill is one of the most imiportant we
have had te deal with, and it should flot be
pressed on us within 24 hotrrs of prorogation.
I would suggest that even if it is to lie put
through it should go over tili to-.niorrow, so
that we may look it over. We should not be
asked to continue in session at this late hour.
Is it to be forced through wit.hout our having
even an opportunity ta give it one hour's consîderation? No one has read over the Bill
until we came here to-night. Is it fair to try
to pass it at this time? Surcly the honourable
gentleman will accede to imy suggestion and
let us go home and have a ýrest, so as we may
he ready 'for the hard day's work that we must
do to-morrow if Parliament. is going to prorogue.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No. I have no
pity for my honourable friend. 11e tan stand
with the youngest and strongeist. Hec can remain here till the wee small hours. We intend to clean the board. I move the second
reading of this Bill.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Honourable gentlemen, the discussion we have heard here to-.
night makes it absolutely clear -that it is not
fair to cail upon us to vote for this Bill without having more information. We have no
information whatcvcr of what this Audit
Board has done in the past to earn its salary,
or what it has accomplished. I do not think
we ought to give the Bill its second reading.
Therefore I move:
That the Bill bie ont now read a second time, but bie
rcad a second tise this day six months.

Hon. 'Mr. REID: I have much pleasure in
seconding the amendment, when wvccannot
have an opportunity to consider the Bill.

CONSIDERED

IN

COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Commnittee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Gordon in the Chair.
,Section 2, subsections 1 and 2 were agreed
to.
On section 2, subsection 3-terma of office:
Hon. Mr. REID: Subsection 3 says:
The persons so appointed shall respectively
oflice for sucli period, not exceeding five years-

hold

I would suggest that it shou;ild be during
pleasure. 1 do not know whether an amendment to that effect would 'be acceptable or
not. If a person is appointed for five years,
and that period is specifically mentioned in
the Order in Council, I think it would be
pretty difficuit ta remove him in the event of
his being unsatisfactory; whereas if the appointment werc made "during pleasure" it
would be more within the control of the
Governor in Council.
Subsection 3 of section 2 was agreed to.
Subsection 4 of section 2 was agreed to.
On section 3-skilled assistance and clerical
assistance:
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Whv does this section take away from the
Civil Service Commission the appointments
to be made? Here is a whoQe body of help,
which may mount up to scores and hundreds,
and this Board, with the approval of the
Treasury Board, may engage them aIl. That
is, the appointments become absolutely Govcrament or party appointments.

Government creates a B.oard of tliis kind and
imposes upon ilt certain obligations, it will
not thrust upon tlie Board persons witli indifferent qualifications to do work which is
known te require knowledge., skil and experiente.
Riglit Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
My honourable friend surely knows that the
statement rnay be absolutely true. It may be
necessary to bave men with certain qualificatiens, but tbe Government will be told, "You
can find sucli men ini our party."
No. I say no
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
because I bave seen the working of this Board.
Wbcn you seek expert knowledge you take
the best man available. In -this case you look
among tbe accoijntants and men of that class,
and generally tliey are outaide of polities
altogether. I bave. in mind special auditera
and accountants in about twenty offices in
Montreal, who do tlie work of very large
concerns, and wlio know that they are serving
people of all shades of opinion. I do flot
believe tbat any <overnment will watch the
Board te see tbat it appoints a Grit or a
Tory. If it did, I sliould think the men appointed would be below the standard.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
If the Government did ý1ot stop te do that,
there would always be Government supporters
on hand to do it.
Tliey do net
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
know wha't takes place.
Riglit Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Their presure and tlieir recommendations
would have te be taken into account. If tbe
argument of my bonourable frîcnd wcre applied te the beads of other Departments, the
Civil Service Act would be donc away witli
entirely. This is a direct blow at the Civil
Service system; but it is only one of many
of wbicb the present Oovernment lias been
guilty.
I do net beHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
lieve tbat.
Hon. Mr. REID: But the honbourable
leader of the Goverument is liardly riglit in
that statement of bis. He lias been referring
to smc special work. He should bave read
a little further in this section. It says:

733

The appointmfent of the whole staff is to
be placed outside of the jurisdiction of the
Civil Service Commission. For clericai work
there is flot one appointment made in any
other Department in this way that you are
now .starting.
As an amendmnent I move that section 3
be amended to read as follows:
Ail appointments necessary for the carrying out of
this Act shall be made by the Civil Service Commission,' in the saie manner as appointinents are made
for other Departinents.

Riglit Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
That takes in skilled -assistance.
Hon. Mr. REID: Yes. Skilled assistance
for this Board will be engaged in the same
way aà for the other Depasrtments. There
is no trouble about employing skilled persons
thTough the Civil Service Commission. If
a Department wants some man temporarily,
the Civil Service Comnmission neyer object.
Riglit Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Surely rny honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) cannot object to that. Surely lie
does not want to ignore entirely the Civil
Service Act, which is applicable to ail other
appointments.
Hon. Mr. DANDtJRAND: My honourable
friend seerns soandalized t.hat we should think
of exempting this organization from the
operations of the Civil Service Act. I have
flot studied the effects of the Bill sufficiently
to know te what extent the staff is freed from
control by the Civil ýService Commission.
My right lionourable friend himsîf, was in
office, not six years ago, as wais my honourable friend hy bis aide, and they created a

formidable staff. I do flot say that that was
extravagant.
I have flot investigtated the
necessity for that staff, but I arn simply
mentioning that this same method was followed in connection with the work of the
Inc-ome Tax Branch. 1 might have h.ad something to say with regard to the distribution
of patronage, if there were such a thing, in
the Income Tax Brandi, which has a large
number of employees. I have asked the
Minister te consider the dlaims of young men
fremn the Sebool of Higher Commercial
Studies. who had fitted tbemselves for the
bigher office work of corporations and large
flrms. I bave Dot said that Mr. A or Mr. B
shoulcl be engaged because he belonged te

preference. That bas been the extent of my
recom-mendati-on. I do flot believe that those
whýo are cbarged witb the administration of
the couintry's affairs are tbinking only of the
Party machine. I would leave considerable
leeway te tËe accountants already on the
Board in the se!ection of a preper staff.

to which the Gommons have disagreed; and
That the fifth amendment he amended by inserting
aft"r the words "special need" in the flfth Itine of
raragraph one of clause a of the said amendments, the
words "or in straitened cireomstances."

7&'

JUNE 25, 1925
Honourable gentlemen will see flhat the
llrst change is merely the dropping of the preamble of the Bill. It does nlot affect the Bill
in any shape or forrn, because the Bill itseif
containe practically what was in the preamble.
As to the other amendment, under the Bill
the judge of the Exchequer Court is given
authority to corne to the relief of depositors
in the Bank who can show that they are in
special need because of the failure of the
Home Bank, and we suggest adding the words,
"£or in straitened circurnstances." We do nlot
think that makes any difference at ail.

in conmnding the action of the bonourable
member for Mille les (Hon. Mr. David). I
look upon this question-and I think my
feelings are shared by every other member
of the Committee-as the greatest question that
bas agitated the minds crf the people of this
country. You have only ta look at; the figures
rnentioned ini the report to sec that I arn nat
exaggera.ting its imnportance.
If I were consulting on'ly my awn personal
interest I wou'ld not be in favour of tbis report, because I appreciate very bighly being
a member of the Board of the C.P.R. I rnay
sity that there is nothing miaterial in my lufe
that I appreciate more than that position, and
I realize perfectly that if effect is given to the
report now presented ta the House it will invalve my dîsappeaxance from that Board. But
this is a matter af sucb great -importance
that ail personal cansideratians mnust disappear.
I wi]l give some figures wbich do not appear in the report. The additions ta the
national obligations of the country for the last
five years were nearly $600,000,000, and for tbe

NIPISSIING CENTRAL RAILWAY
On the Orders of the Day:
lion. Mr. DANDURAND:
The honourable gentleman from, Nipissing (Hon. Mr.
Gordon) yesterd-ay raised a question regard ing
the action of the Federal Government in connection with 'the construction of a railway
to the Rouyn district.
I told him that I
understood an Order in Council had heen
passed referring the matter to the Su-preme
Court, and I promised Vo bring down a copy
of that Order in Council, if such existed.
I
now lay a copy on the Table of the House
for the information of my honourable friend.
AUSTRALIAN TRADE TREATY BILL
THIRD

READING

Bill 2.38, an Act respecting trade relations
wîth Austra1ia.-Iion. Mr. Dandurand.
BOARD OF AUDIT BILL
FURTHER CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

The Senate again went into Committee
on Bill 233, an Act to constitute a Board of
Audit.
Hon. Mr. Gordon in the chair.
On section &-e-killed assistance and clerical
assistance:
Hon. Mr. DANDUtRAND:
I have given
the explanations contained in the memorandum 1 hold in my hand to, the honourahie
gentleman fromn Grenville (Hon. Mr. Reid);
but I will give themn to the House.
I felt, that the Department of Justice knew
more about the draf.ing of this Bill than
perhapsG any other department, aithougli the
proposed measure emanated from. the Department of Finance; so I went to see the Deputy
IMinister of Justice this morning and asked
.him, for bis views as to the scope and application of this clause.
Here is the statement of the Deputy Minister of Justice, who
,e-plaýins that he has made inquiry cf the
Department of Finance:
RIe Section 3, B:ll 233-An Act to constitute a Board
of Audit
With reference to your enquiry whether the provision
of this section will override in any way tise provisolis
of the Civil Service Act, I arn of opinion that so
far as thse first sentence of thse section is concerned,
an8wer is clearly in thse negative-

~the

That it does not override the provisions of
the Civil Service Act-for the reason that it deals only witis the engaging
of skilled assistants, and does not purport to authorize
any appointinents to the Civil Service, either temporary
or permanent.
XVith regard to the second and last sentence of the
clause, wisich deals with tise supply of sncb clerical
assiatance as may be necoessary for the pùrposes of the

S-47

737

Board, 1 find uipon enqu!ry f rom thse Finance Department tisat it la ot thse intention to create any clerical
staff at Ottawa, but tisat tise purpose of tise provision
is to enable the Treasury Board f0 authorize any particular member of tise Board wbo may be performing
any part of bis dues from time f0 time in any part of
thse country to employ sucis clerical assistance as he
inay require in the places te wlsîcb he may go, or at
which hie may be performing bis duties for tise tim.'
being. So fac as any clerical assietance at Ottawa la
concerned, it la anticiputed tbat it caon be made available from existing staffs, and tisat it la unlikely tisat it
wiil be necessary to make any additions to, tise Service
for thse purposes of tise Board. If, however, it sisou'I.
become necesaary to make any apointment, as, for instance, in tise case of a secretary, I amn dispoaed f0
tbink tisat under tise section as it stands sucb appointment could ise made iby direction of tise Treasury Bord
witbout reference to tise Civil Service Commission.
Tise corresponding sections ils tise Board of Audit
Act, 1923, are as follows'ýl3. The Board may sciti tise consent of tise Minister
of Finance, engage fromn time to time sucis skslled
assistants as may ise required to facilitate tise work of
tise Board, and sucis assistants ioay be paid sncb comnpensation as tise Treasury Board may allow.
"14. Any clerical duties tisat may be necessary for tise
purposes of tise Board sali be performed by sues rueraber or members of tise staff of tise Auditor General of
Canada, as hie may designate for sucs purpose."
You will observe tisat tise diffrence between section
14 of tise old Act and tise present Bill is tisat former
limita tise sstpply of clerical assistance to tisat wbicb
could be made available f rom tise staff of tise Auditor
General of Canada, wbereas tise present mneasure enables
tise Treaaury Board to supply clerical assistance from any
Govemment departmnent, and also in tise mamser abive
indicated.
For instance, if a memiser of tise Board
resident at Toronto desired to prepare bis report tisere.
ie could ise autborized by tise Treasury Board to
employ bis own stenograpiser or anotiser available stessograpiser at prevailing rates, instead of isaving to employ a memiser of tise departmental staff st Ottawa.

That is signed by the Deputy Minister of
Justice, Mr. Edwards.
There is, I may say, a slight variation in
the formation of this Board, 'which explaine
the difference between te Bill before us and
the Act as we have it in the Statute Book. It
ss not -the intention to, retain the Auditor General as the Ohairman of that Board, inasmuch
as he himnself bas found that his position ahead of the Board came into confli!ct with bis
duties as Auditor General and sometimes
placed him in a somewhat false position.' Besides, his work engages ail his time.
My right honourable friend (Right Hon.
Sir George E. Foster) asked me yesterday if
the Auditor General oould point to any reforms or gains that have resulted from bis
appointment. The Auditor Gepneral is following up various line2 of investigation to make
his work as effective as possible. I would
draw the attention of my right honourable
friend to a newspaper despateli from. Edmonton, the statements whicha I have verifled.
It appeared in te Ottawa Citizen of June 25,
and reads as follows:
Edmsonton, Alla., June 25.-H1af a million dollars overpaid to tise Alberta govemrment on cashs subsidy s-

count is the latest development in the natural resources
relatio.ns between the province and the Dominion. A
claim te thant effect bas cone through from Ottawa.
and is now in process of negotiation between the two
governrnents. If no other seuliement can be agreed on,
the present prospect is that the sum wilI be deductei
from whatever cash payments may stili be made frorn

blarncd for the everpayment.

I have ascertained that the Auditor Generalhad put in a special expert f0 examine the
bookkeeping regarding payments to the
provinces, and I arn under the impression
that a large ovcrpayment, similar to that
made to Alberta, has been made also to
another province. This overpayment cover'd
quite a number of years. Therefore I suggest to my right honourable friend that h.c
suspend judgment as to the efficacy of the
work of tihe Auditor General. One cannot
familiarize himself with ail that work within
i, few months. It is necessary to find one's
footing, to know one's staff, to examine into
existing conditions. in order then to decide
on the reforms to be suggested. I hope we
shall not .begrudge him his statutory increase,
and 1 hope also that Parliament will ,ce to
it that the increase which is voted annually
f0 the Auditor Generai is included permanently in bis salary, as he should be an independent officiai under the control of Parliament, his salary flot subjeet to an annual
vote.
Riaht Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable gentlemen, I do flot want to
judge t.he new Auditor General harshly, and I
did flot intend my remarks of last night to
bear that interpretation. I did thin'k, however, that so far we had no very strong
evidences of reforms having been made, whe
we had information of clashes of opinion
between himself and various Ministers.
My rigt honHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ourable friend remembers the experience of
the late Mr. Macdougall, who quite often
wrestled with the Finance Department.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Mr. Macdouýgall was a sturdy wrestler.
Hon. Mr. REID:

He was a big, strong

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
But. leaving aside for the moment the
Auditor General, the opinion from. the
Departmen't of Justice whieh my honourable
friend has read, being placed on our Minutes,
will make certain, I suppose, the assurance
that the first part of clause 3 does not take
the empicyment of skilled assistance from
under the provisions of the Civil Service Act.
I think we are bound to accept the opinion
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

of the Department of Justice on this point,
and that opinion having been made public
in this Chamber and put on record, I have
no disposition to cavîl with it. or try to add
surety by additional legislation.
With reference to the second part of clause
3, the opinion of the Department of Justice
is in line wit-h my contention, that the appointment of a secretary, assistant secretaries. and
other heýlp that may be considered necessary,
under the direction of the Treasury Board, and
placed here in Ottawa, right in t he centre of
the Civil Service estabiishment, sets a rather
bad example, and one not very satisfactory
to the Civil Service as a whole.
I noticed a very fine indication of the
spirit of the Civil Service in a newspaper
report this morning of the convention being
held here of the custo'ms; officiais of the whoie
Dominion. The convention was quite unanimous, so far as I could judge, and indicated
a proper spirit of appreciation on the part of
the service, as represented by that very
important body, towards the Civil Service
Commission. Points of difference and little ili
feelings may arise-the idea that one has been
negiected, or is not treated accordine to merit;
but it is very satisfactory to know that bet.ween the Civil Service Commissioners and an
important branch of the outside service there
is perfect unanimity. The convention ended
by passing unanimously a resointion affirming
t.he necessity of maintaining in its integrity
the Civil Service Act, with suLcli improvements
as cao be made.
W/e know that one of the greatest causes
of discord and dissatisfaction in the Civil
Service bas been the feeling that the deserving
man who did his work quitely without using
pull or being officions in trying to push himself forxvard, was very apt to find himself
superceded by someone who was a favourite,
with the powers for the time ýbeinýg. That
condition created a feeling of injustice, inequalîty and unfair play that went right to
the root of Civil Service discipline and effectiveness.
I think it would be a pity, just for the
sake of aiiowing the Audit Board to appoint
a secretary and clerical help, not to have
that donc under the Civil Service Commissioners, that is, in accordance with the Act.
Does mv honourable frien.d think that a
matter oà sufficient importance to justify maki ng a break? The employment now and then
of' help fromn outside, as when a man wants
a stenographer, is reasonable; but working
officiais here such as a secretary, an assistant
secretary and other help, should surely be
appointed under the Civil Service Act.

JUNE 26, 1925
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
When the
Deputy Minister of Justice and I read the
clause togother, he reinarked: "Well, the only
office t-hat would be witbdrawn froan the Civil
Service Commission under my reading of this
clause would be possibly the Socretary; that
is ail." I believe that the secretary wbo is
now employed is a member of the Departmental staff, and not a new mnan, and when
we know that this Audit Board works under
the wing of the Finanoe Departmnent, I wonder
if it is wortb while to alter this clause. The
Board will naturally draw upon the staff of the
Finance Department. I just put the question
to my rigbt honourable friend. I believe that
the Minister of Finance, who would bo consulted by the Board, wouid noV ask the
Treasury Board to place a newcomer in the
work of a Board which is only provîsional
and tem.porary, and should end in. a few
yeras. I wonder if it is worth while Voimake
an aniendment for this individuai case.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
And I in turn wondor whetheýr it is worth
while Vo place any Minister in a preferred
position Vo that of any other Minister, by
giving him the right to go outside, of the
Civil Service Act for a possible appointment
to an office in wbich ho already has. us My
honourable friend says, a man who is under
the Civil Service Act. The Minister bas al
he wants, and he got it through the Civil
Service Commission.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No, the officiaI
was taken fromn the Department.
Right H-on. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
But, thero ¶night be anothor Finance Minister
in office. The present Goverument might be
'bowled out, and anotheir Government mîglit
come in, -and you would open the door for it
to týake its first step, of laVe years, along the
bad lino of political patronage.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
1 helio-ve that
our attention should rather lie devoted Voi
tcying Vo bring under the Civil Service Commission the thousands of officials who are Voday in the Incomo Tax Department.. I think
that would ho a moire laudeible and serious
step than to amend this Bill in order Voi
cover
one officer. I think rny right honourable
friend is correct on general linos, but lie will
notice that even. underthe Civil Service Commission enactinent oonsiderable leeway is
given to Departments, to employ tempjorary
or skilled help; so that Vhs provision is not
opening the door Vo any consîderable extent.
Hon. Mr. TIJRRIFF: I notice that this
Bill adde stilI further to the .cost of the De8-474

739

partment of the AudiVor General. The salary
of that official was raised from $6,000 Vo
$15,000 at one jump, although it was provided
in tho Act now on the Statute Book that
ho was noV to get any extra salary. The
Auditor Genoral will now geV bis $15,000 a
year, and an extra $1,000 for acting as Chairman of this Board. I notice also that the
Vice-Chajrcnan 'will not, as in the past, bo
the Deput-y Minister -of Finance. I wouid
like to ask my bonourable friend what grounds
there aire for putting up the salary of that
officiai. $5,000 this year, in view of the fact
that four yeaTs ago it, was 5increased by
$1,000.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
0f whom is
the honourable gentleman speaking?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: The Deputy Mînister
of Finanoe, Mr. Saunders.
Hon. Mr. DANDIIRAND: My honourable
friend must remember ithat that officiai bas
shown efficioncy in a Department which bas
grown out of ail proportion to what is was
25 years ago. The responsibility of to-day is
noV what it was in. previous yoars; and when
the Minister of Finance consulta mon of substance in the country as Vo, the employment
of a man wbo will lie equal Vo -the task, lie
is told that the amaîl sum of 86,000 or 810,000
could noV secure the proper person Vo administer the Finance Department.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: But we had him.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Yes, we had
him; 'bu.t bore is a man who bas reached 70
years of age, and is perhaps near the end of
his career, who bas shown that lie posseses
prudence, wbo lias had long experience, and
cen ho relied upon. Wben lie expresses bis
desire Vo retire, I wonder if ho sbouid noV lie
placed on a par with mon, in similar positions
outsido, whýo have less responsibulity, but wbo
art treated in a far 'more genorous way than.
wo have been treating our officiais.
In this connection 1 cite the case of the
AudiVor General. The Minister of Finance
]ooked among accountanits eonnected *with
large corporations to find a nman who oould
properly Vo the work of the Auditor General
of Canada; and, in order Vo secure a man
who had the nocossary reputation and oxperience, and who had ithe esteern of the coanmunity in which lie worked, lie bad Vo come
up to that figure. 0f course, a young man
might ho found to fill thie position. 'but when
the appointment of an Auditor General of
Canada is in question, it stands to reason that
Vo obtain a man who lias made a reputation
for huiself, wbo bas built up a clientele, it

SENATE
is worth far more than the $15,000 which was
offered to Mr. Gonthier. When a man has
reached 45 or 50 years, and has gained the
confidence of the corporations, the banks, and
the general community, the sum of $15,000
does not loom as large in his eyes, or in that
of his associates. as it does to some other
people.
But my honourHon. Mr. TURRIFF:
able friend must surely remember the effect
of the action of this Government in jumping
up the salary of the Deputy Minister of
Finance by $4,000. The result was that every
Deputy Minister in the Service was dissatisfied, and the Government had to raise the
salary of every Deputy Minister and of every
official ranking as a Deputy Minister by
$2.000. There would have been no demand
whatever for that if the salary of that one
Deputy had not been increased. The same
remark applies to the present Auditor General
He has been given $15,000, and the Deputy
Minister's salary is noiw increased $5,000; so
there will bc another raid on the treasury by
officials generally. What answer can the Government make when the Deputy Ministers
come to them and ask for an increase on the
ground that they have as much responsibility
as the Deputy Minister of Finance?
I may tell my honourable friend thouglh lie
knows it as well as I do, that some years
ago the Deputy Minister of Finance lust to
this country some $26.000,000 through a mistake made ;n the Department in connection
with moneys due by the British Government
to Canada. The matter was left to arbitration, and owing to that mistake made by the
Department of Finance, which is under the
Deputfy Minister, who was responsible for the
making of it, we lost that large sum.
But surely my
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable friend does not hold the present
Deputy Minister of Finance responsible for
that error, if there was any-because it was always denied that there was any error in the
Department of Finance.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: He was the Deputy
Minister.
But the judgHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ment of Mr. Asquith, now Lord Oxford, was
not based on tlat supposed error.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: The information that
should have been sent to the British Government never left the Department; that is
exactly the position. Now $15,000 is being
paid to one man as salary, and $15,000 to
the second man, and the effect wi be that
other Deputies will press whatever GovernHon.

I would draw
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the attention of my honourable friend to this
situation. For over 20 years I believe the
Deputy Minister of Justice received $10,000.
vhile the other Deputy Ministers received
only $6.000. I think that the Deputy Minister
of Railways and Canals, who also acted as
the Chief Engineer, got $10,000. All the other
Deputy Ministers understood that those two
officials had responsihility and special knowledge which entitled them to the larger pay,
and I do not know that they made any protest against it.
The Hon the CHAIRMAN: I would caU
the attention of the House to the fact that
clause 3 is under consideration, and that the
other sections, that are now being discussed,
have been passed.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: What I rose to point
out was the fact that we were adding more
cost.
Hon. G. G. FOSTER: Before the clause
passes, I want to say one word with regard
to the discussion that has taken place concerning the Auditor General. I quite uderstand the attitude taken by honourable gentlemen with reference to the incrense of salaries
of Deputy Ministers and heads of departments, and I share with them in that.
It is not often that I concur in the appointmay
ments made by this Government; but I
say that when the present Auditor Generail
was appointed to the position which he now
occupies the greatest pleasure was expressed
by all in the city and the Province from
which he comes, irrespective of party, nationwho
ality, or anything else. He was a man
stood at the very height of his profession, a
he
man whose services, sought by all, could
obtained only under exceptional circumstinceS.
Knowing the position that he occupied, and
the confidence that the banks and other large
financial institutions had in him, I was
astonished when he left his home and friends
and business and came to Ottawa to take this
nat
position. So far as I am concerned, I do
think $15,000 is one cent too much for him.
If the business were my own, and I could
choose any man in the Province to assume the
responsibilities that the Auditor General has
undertaken, I would select the man who has
been appointed by the Government, and I
hope nothing will be done here to discourage
him in his work or in retaining lis office
when, financially, lie might occupy an equally
good or better position in his home city.

JUNE 26, 1925
Hon. Mr. REID: Last evening 1 moved
an amendment to this section. After the explanations that have been given -by the leader
of the Government, and the placing on record
of the document frorn the Deputy Minister
of Justice, I do flot feel justified in in.sisting
on that arnendment. I would, therefore, with
the leave of the House, withdraw it.
I wish to say, however, that if the honourable the Leader of the Governrnent had
given us .last night the explanations that hie
bas given us this rnorning, I do not tbink
there would have been very rnuch discussion
on the Bill. The trouble was that the Bill
was presented without anyone knowing anything about it. I do flot blarne the Lader
of the Government for that. 1 cannot understand how hie keeps himself so well posted
with regard to, aIl the'Bis that corne before
this House.
Hear, hear.
Some Hon. SENATORS:
Hon. Mr. REID. He bas the task of
giving information about every Bill that
cornes before us, and he must be an encyclopedia, or something of that sort, to possess ail
the information that hie carnies in bis head.
I arn glad that this discussion bas taken
place this morning, for I arn sure that now
we aIl feel better satisfied, and are probaýbly
prepared to vote differently from wbat we
would have done last night.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Reid was
withdrawn.
Section 3 was agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed to.

TITE SENATE'S WORK AND LEADERS
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gentlemen, I desire to congratulate the Senate
on the way in wbieb it bas done its work
during this Session. We ail know that in
the Iast days or weeks of the Session legislation generally corning to this Chamber muât
be' studied more rapidly than we would like;
but to-day, at our first sitting, we bave cleared
the Order Paper and are awaiting the good
plea sure of the other House.
I feel that I owe to, my colleagues an expression of my appreciation of the diligence
that they have shown not only in the work of
the Senate itself, but in our various committees. Thie standard of attendance in the cornmitteeýs bas been very bigb, and I may say
that T have heard from outaide cominenda-

741

tion of the manner in whicb the Senate bas
studied the Bills that bave come before it
and bas applied itself to a fair and proper
solution of the problems presented.
I believe that the work of the Committpe
that was presided over by my honourable
friend the Senator from Middleton (Hon. W.
B. Ross) will stand out as an important contribution by the Senate to the solution of
the railway problem. Tbat problemr is one
that should receive the attention and engross the minds of aIl the people ýof Canada.
Unless there is a rapid solution of that problem our liabilities will go on increasing, therehy increasing the fixed charges. The statement of the 'bonourable gentleman frorn de
Salaberry (Don. Mr. Béique) showing the
prescrnt capitalization of the Canadian Pacifie
Railway, cornpared with the increase to a
like amount during the last six years of the
liabilities of the Canadian National Railways,
should cause our people to ponider upon the
importance of, this problem, and I hope that
next Session, as was suggested by the honourable gentleman from Middleton (Hon. W.
B. Ross), the Senate will continue to show
an mnterest in this problern and in its solution.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Af.ter the presentation of the figures by the
honourable Senator referred to, it struck me
that it would be an excellent thing to have
them go out in the document with the report.
The figures presented are very illirminating,
and 1 wonder whether it is flot possible to,
have the financial statement acconîpany the
report when it is distrihuted.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, we on this side of the House
cannot permit the very courteous ahnd coinplimentary references wbieh my bonourable
fniend bas made to pass by witbouL expressing our appreciation of thie very able way in
which bie has discbarged the duty of leading
this House during the present Session.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Be bas bad
our deepest sympatby on many occasions,
because we knew that hie was dealing wîth
measures, the promulgation of which. was distanctly against bis convictions, but, whicb,
after considerable troutble, bie apparently was
able to accomplish.
I think 1 arn expressing the feelings of honourable gentlemen on this side of the House
wben 1 say that in my bonourable friend the
Goverrncnt bas one of the most capable
men that could be selected in Canada to, les.d

continue to Iead in 'the very acceptable way

he sits to the right or to the left of the

Hon. Mr. CA'SGRAIN: As we have jus,

there is no such tbing in this House as a
Goveroment or an Opposition, and that we

reinoved from political or party exigencies.
I must say of the honourable gentleman
that bis industry and patience are extraordinary. It is not only bonourable gentlemen
on tbe other side who worry bini at times:
tbere are some who ait very close to bim who
often hother him. But he la always patient
and courteous, and willing to listen to whatever may be aaid. 1 believe that a wiae selection was made when the honourable gentleman was appointed the Leader of tbis flouse.
We ail know bow difficuit it must be at times
to carry measures despite an adverse mai ority
and somctimea in the face of adverse votes
on the part of those who are supposed to be
affiliated witb the party in power. Still, th?
bonourable gentleman neyer loaes bis equanimity and la neyer ruffled. On many occasions
I have felt obliged to desert my Leader, for
wbich I bave been truly sorry; but I bave always on those occasions been convinced that
he did ot blame me very much.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: I bave just a few words
to say. Both sides of the flouse must be

proud of their Leaders.

As to tbe Senate. I think it proper tbat, I
ahould say a few words. I bave said and

Hon. Mr. DAVID:

It was under the iniluence of such feelings as I have referred to

that I judged proper to ask for tbe appointment of a committee to ýendeavour to find
isome means of rescuîng the country from the
disastrous position in which it found itself
iby reason of the National Railway. I was

confident tbat the Committee named by the
iSenate would make a report which would be
appreciated by the public, and which would.
ceause the Government to act. I have not
been deceived in thate' and the result of the
work of tbe Gommittee sbows tbat the idea
waa a good one. When 1 conceived the idea

I relied upon the help of tbe honourable
imember for de Salaherry (Hon. Mr. Béique)
and alan mpon tbat of tbe Cbairman and other
members of the Committee. My confidence
in them bas been justified, and I arn convinced that everybody must be satisfied that
the Sonate bas done a gond work.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Honourable gentlemen, the third party in ýthis Chamber wishes
to associate itseîf witb ail the cnmplimentary
things tbat bave been said of tbe Leader of
the Government, and alan of the Lýeader of
tbe Opposition.
1 do not think two better
men could be selected frorn this Chamber
or from any otber Chamber in Canada to
dill tbe positions wbicb they occupy.
Ever
aince my bonourable friend the present Leader
,of the inusýe bas been in the pnsitinn wbich
,he now occupies, the adroitness and smooth,ness with whieb be bas got tbrough legislation with wbicb the majority in the House
,did not agree bas been a marvel to me. And
'it speaka well for the members of the Opposition that they have been so fair and

reasonable in these matters.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

ilear, hear.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I can only bope
,that my bonourable friend will flot take to
beart tno miicb the harsh thinga that I bave
said at tirnes about bis Government. I had
the justificati-on, at ail eveýnts, *of believingthat tbey were absolutely true.
As long as tbe present G.overnment re,mains in power, I trust that my honourable
friend will be the Leader in this flouse, and
that be will continue to, show the sarne kind,neas and consideration that lie hmas hown
during the past four years.

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, I highly appreciate the kindly remarks that have fallen from. the lips of the
!members of this Chamber. I simply desire
to add that at the opening of the Session 1
was quite upset when I observed that I was
sitting opposite an empty seat. My honourtable friend who leads the othex side (Hon.
Sir James Lougheed) J.iad fallen prey to a
very serious disease, and notbing pleased me
mare than to see him restored ta health and
back in bis place in tbds Chamber.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. M r. DANDURAND:
Reverting to
the matter that is with us, and that unfortuns! ely will be with us for some time, the
railway problem, I would suggest that we add
.ta the report which. is about to be printed
the speeches made in explanation of tbe resolution by- -tbe honourable gentlemen from
Middleton (Hon. W. B. Ross), and De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique). I think their remarks will came in as a natural addition ta
-the report.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Tbat will fill the bill.
Bon. Mr. DANDURAND: No resolution is
neeessary. The Clerk of the Hanse will see
tb2t this is done.
THE MANUFACT'URE OF COKE
INQUIRY

Honi. Mr. DANIEL: I noticed a few days
ag-o that a resolution had been introduced
and passed in another place witb regard ta a
proposed subsidy for tbe manufacture of
coke. Can the honourable Leader state
whetber or not that proposal is ta be proceeded with?
lIon. M'r. DAN DURAND: I do not know
wbat form that proposal would take. Would
it be an item in the Supply Bill?
Hlon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It is 3 per cent
of the cost, for ffteen years.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN:
It was introduced as a resolution by the Minister of the
Interior. The resolution was te the effeet
that 3 per cent of the approved cost of various
plants be given on the condition that coke
is manufactured out of ýCanadian coal.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: It is for a period
of fifteen years ouly.
H-ori. Mr. MeLENNAN: The measure is
extremely important, particularly ta the
Lower Provinces.

THE BUSINESS 0F PARLIAMENT
Hon. Sir JAMES L0UGIIEED: I would
suggest ta, my honourable friend that if there
are other measures on the Order Paper he
should advise the Prime Minister that this
is a very inopportune time ta submit them.
to this Bouse. It would be very much more
acceptable to this Chamber that they should
be. withhelýd by the Bouse of Commons than
be sent here and rejected. We have no desire ta meet in an unfriendly spirit newv legislation that may be brought down, but, as my
honourable friend can readily un*derstand, it
would be utterly impossible ta give proper
consideration ta any impartant measure at
this late hour.
Bon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I will communicate ta the Prime Minister the opinion
expressed by my honourable friend.

THE SENATE'S WORK AND LEADERM
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr, DAVID: Bonourable gentlemen,
ta what il said this morning, 1 wish to add *a
few words of congratulation, felicitaition and
thanks to the bonourable -the Speaker of the
Senate. 1 have -just leamed thfat he is about
ta leave for Europe with bis amiable wif e. I
think I eLýpress rthe feelàng of &Il the memJbers
of -this Bouse in wishing him and Madame
Bostack bon voyaige. At the same time I
think it proper te say that we muit aIl congratulate -the honourable, the Speaker .upon
the distinotion and tact with which he fulfils
bis important frmnction.
We muist net forget aur Clerk and his
assiaitants, and .thank them. for their zeal and
kiadness, and the pains which'they'have taken
ta give satisfaction ta the members of the
Senate.
As a Ist word, I would say ta the honourable leader of the Bouse, in order that he mey
relpeet it to bis colleagues the memibers of the
Cabinet, that I share the view tihat not
enough wark is given ta the members of the
Senate during the first weeks of the Session,
while too much is crowded iýnto the Iast days,
when we tuannot, give -te im~portant legilatio

SECOND READING POSTPONED

Hon. Mr. DANDLT RAND:

Will the lion-

ouraUble gentlemena of the Senate allow me,
n explanatian of tbis Bill, which I confess
I look at for the first timie, ta read it aü
the
Senate, as it may be self -explanatory.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUJGHEED:
Surely
my bonourable friend does nat intend ta introduce at t-his stage, of the proceedings a

Bill toucbing agricultural credits. that will in
the final analysis involve millions of dollars.
This is one of the mast important Bills that
bas been brou.ght before us this Session, in-

volving probably an expenditure of larger
,lms than any otber.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Han. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 0f course,
that is a trifling amaunt ta the present Govornment, but ta tb.is aide of the House it

Han. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
I know.
We malde a luaîi the uther day ta the Quebec

flot received any interest. But the objection
is flot so much because of that as because of
the controversial nature of the whole questioù. I venture to say that no measure tbat
bas been brought hefore the flouse this Session involves s0 rnuch difference of opinion
as tbds Bill. The subject is flot new to us.
My honourable friend the senior member
for Ot:,awa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) gave us an
interesting disquisition on this problem some
time ago, but wh.ile bis explanations were
illuminating, I fancy that a certain amount
of scepticism stili remains as to the desirability
of accepting the principle of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BELiCOUTRT: I jo'ined witb the
special friends of my honourable friend; I
did not do it alone.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 1 would
say to my honourable friend that it would
be very undesirable to dispose of this Bill
by means not of the most gentie character,
namely, the six months' hoist, and I hope he
will no' thrust upon us the necessity of dealing
in that summary way with many important
measures. This particular one might wel
command tbe best attention of this flouse
for weeles. It should go to a Special Committee, and tbere should be the widest investigation into tbis subject. Once t.he Dominion
Government enters upon such a plan as this,
510,OOW,OO will be simply the beginning of
the expend4iture that must neceasarily be macle.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gentlemen, I recognize that 1 have flot given
ail the attention that I should have done to
this question of rural credits, and I have
only a general knowledge of it. 1 have read
somewhat hastily the t.wo renorts of Dr. Tory,
but I confess that my mmnd is not macle up
as to the best scheme. UlJness the majority
of tbis Chainber feel tbat they are sufficiently
informed on the question, and ready to endorse the Bill after a féw bours' study -in
Committee which we could give it, I will not
insist upon pressing the Bill to a second reading; but I would like to have a clear understanding of the wish of thbe Senate. I realize
that this Bill could be given considerable attention at the beginning of a Session, or
tbrougbout a Session, by one of our Committees; but it will 'be for the Senate to say,
and if my bonourable friend states thât he
speaks for his side of the flouse, that seties
tbe matter.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: In further
explanation of what I have said, may I add
that during the war my honourable friend
from Middleton (Hon. W. B. Ross) and myself were members of wbat wss known as the

74.1

Economic Commission, and we made a very
lengthy investigation and study of this subject. We called the leading experts upon
it, not only in Canada, but in Great Britain
and the United States, and went into the
problem at great Iengtb and carefully, and
with mnore or less sympathetie attention. The
more we probed the problem, the more dou'btfui we were as to the desirability of making
any recomniendation respectimg it. So that
I can assure my honourable friend that I
have flot ligbtly raised my objections. I know
the dîfficulties in dealing witb a subjcct of tbis
nature.
There are very few subI ects on wbich a
greater différence of opinion exists than upon
this one, and, inasmuch as it involves the
expenditure of a very considerable sum of
money, it would not be in the interest of the
public at this stage, when prorogation is just
awaiting us, for us to take u~p this Bill and
ligbtly deal with it by giving two or three
bours attention to it.
Hon. Mr. REID: 1 aniglt add tbat if there
is any danger of any of the farmers suffering
between now and the next Session, the trouble
migbt be overcome by the bonourable leader
of the Governiment .and other members of
the Government endorsing any notes in the
mieantime.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEE.D: Say a
ccmpasîonate allowance.
Hon. Mr. POPE: There is no one more
interested personally than myseif in this question, for I know the difficulties of the farming community to-day in the matter of banking. The present banking systemn does not
lend itself to long loans, even of two years;
it deals only in short.tme loans, going not
beyond three or four xnonths. The banking
system of Canada does not serve the farming
community as it should. But I quite agree
with the honourable leader on this side that
we must not go at this question rashly, and
possibly make the present situation more
complicated than it is to-day for the farmers
of the country. While Il hope to see some
sucb plan as that mentioned in the Bihl carried
out at some timne, on a sound business basis,
I do not think we should be asked to deal
finally with tbis Bill this afternoon.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: The subject involved
in tbis Bill is a very large and intricate one.
I think I can fairly say that I spent a month
in an examînation of different plane for rural
credits. There are certain features of the
subject on which we shaîl bave to take great
care. Sebemes that work in Europe, a densely

Hon. E. MICHENER: Honaurable gentlemen. it is unfortunate that this Bill h.is been
so long delayed in coming to this House.
Personally I arn in favour of a proper form.
of rural credits, and think they would he of
great advantage in the promotion of farming,
especially in Western Canada, where there is
pr&.ctically no such money available. This,
of course, involves the question of a system
of financing for the encouragernent of agriculture. Most other great agricultural countries have already adopted some scheme. I
recognize the fact that our present systern
does not give encouragement te farmers and
if there is any country in the wold that
needs such a system, as the one proposed, it
is Canada, especia.lly Western 'Canada.
I do not wish, however, te go into a discussion of this question. I really believe that
if we had had thia Bill before us a few weeks
ago there would have been *no difficalty in
the way of diseussing it and of its beceoming
law. I have glanced over the Bill. It rerely
puts the Provinces in a position to carry on
their own administration for the loaning of
this money. While I will be very ranch disappointed if the Bill falîs by the way, I
recognize the force of the arguments of my
Leader (Hon. Sir James Lougheed) and of
the last speaker (Right Hon. Sir George E.
Foster), and realize. in the face of the diverse
views that are held on this questtion, that its
passage is almost too much to, hope for.
Hon. N. A. BEICOURT: Honourable gentlemen, the subjeet-matter of this Bill bas
interested me for many years. I feel that
this is probably the easiest and most direct
way of hringing assistance to the farming
comrnunity. I think there is a pretty general feeling abroa-d, and in this House, that
we shoubd do something for the farmers. I
agree, however, with the honourable gentlemen who have preceded me, and would not
ask that this measure be gone on with. This
is a most important piece of legislation, and
I feel sure that if we were to go into the euh.iect it would not receive the consideration
which it deserves. It involves a prînciple
which probably cannot be applied in this
country in the saine way and to the samne ex-

74'

tent that it bas been applied in Europe and
the United States, where it bas met with great
success. If we were to go on with the Bill,
I think it would receive a black eye-the
House would have to put itself on record as
flot being prepared to pass it; and the position
would then be much worse than it now is.
For these reasonis, I would advise my Leader
flot to go on with the Bill at this time.
The Bill is
Hon. GEORGE GORDON:
flot on my file, and 1 have flot seen it; but
1 would gather frorn the remarks of the
Leader of the House that it, concerns a boan
by the Governrnent to the western Provinces.
Hon. Mr. TTJRRIFF: Not to the wresterna
Provinces any more than to the eastern
Provinces.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: It is a loan.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: To any Province.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I arn unable to see
any reason why the Governrnent of Canada
should rnake a loan for this purpose. Have
the various Provinces bast theif credit? If
they have not, I think this matter 2rould be
lef t entirely to the Provinces; and T think
they should corne to the Dominion Government for assistance of this kind only when
their credit, is gone.
I arn in accord with my colleagues on thi3
side of the House in protesting against a
Bill of thig nature coming down at such a late
day in the Session.Hoo. Mr. DANDURAND: I quite understand the feeling of the memabers of the Senate.
I have moved the second reading of the
Bibi, but if rny honourable friend opposite
will move that the Bill be not now read a
second time but be postponed to next Session
for study and consideration, I will accept the
motion.
Hon. Mr. TURRIEF: Before action is
taken, I would like to point out that if the
Bill should pass there is no likelihood, in fact
no possibility, of the Dominion Goverament
making any loss; it is only to advance the
$10,000,000. I would like to find out, if I
can, what division is proposed. Is the $10,000,000 to be advanced to the different Provinces
equally, or in proportion to their population
or in proportion to their requests?
As I have said, so far as the West is concerned, there is no possibility of bass, and the
Bill would serve a good, purpose. There are
many farmers in the West who are paying 8
per cent for farrn boans. That situation was
brought about chiefiy by the action of the
local Government which made rules and regu-

JUNE 26, 1925
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes. Of course,
insurance is a gamble. A Civil Servant may
on retirement withdraw his balance in the
Retirement Fund. That amount, which in
some cases is a large one, has accrued to the
credit of the Civil Servant or his estate.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Does he get any
interest on that?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Not if he elects
to come under the Superannuation Act. By
relinquishing his right ta that sum, he becomes
entitled to a pension on retirement. Naturally
he will lose the pension at his death. I think
the Act provides, however, that his widow may
receive a certain proportion of his allowance.
The State stands to gain in the case of a
Civil Servant who is single and who, having
transferred his credit to the Superannuation
Fund, retires on a pension, but lives only a
short time to enjoy it.
The Civil Servant was given until, I think,
the 19th of July next to nake bis choice, and
the effect of this Bill is to extend that period
for another year:
1. (1) The Civil Service Superannuation Act, 1924, is
amended by striking out the words "one year" in the
second Pine of section sixteen thereof and substituting
therefor the words "two years".
(2) The said Act is amended by striking out the
words "one year" in the second line of section twenty
and substituting therefor the words "two years".
(3) The said Act is further amended by striking out
the words "one year" in the first 'ine of section twentytwo and substituting therefor the words "two years".

The object of the Bill is quite clear, namely,
to give Civil Servants who are under the
Retirement Act a further period of twelve
months in which to decide whether or not
they will relinquish the benefits of the Retirement Fund and come under the Superannuation Act.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: It
seems to be a fair thing to do. The Retirement Fund balance is the man's own money.
He must make up his mind whether he will
continue under the Retirement Fund or take
the equivalent advantage that would accrue
to him by transferring that Retirement Fund
balance into the general fund and coming
under the provisions of the Superannuation
Act. He had the privillege of making his
choice within a year, but sometimes it is
pretty difficult for a man to make up his
mind. He may think at first that the transfer
would not be to his advantage, and may let
the option slip by. I do not think it is at
all wrong to give hiim another year to decide.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: What I am about to
say has no bearing on this particular clause.
but I would like to draw the attention of
my honourable friend the leader of the House

749

to the fact that there is a great deal of dissatisfaction in the Service about the distinction that is made, with respect to the Retirement Fund between men and women. It
appears that, while a man may wdill to any
person the amount standing to his credit in
the Fund, a woman cannot do so. I do net
understand the matter very weli, but a number of women Civil Servants have complained
about women being treated so differently
from men. I would like my honourible
friend to look into this question, so that we
may deal with it next year if it is one that
ought to be dealt with; and I think it is.
I cannot for the liife of me understand why
a woman contributing to the Fund out of
her salary of say $1,000, is not in exactly the
same position as a man contributing at the
same rate. The distinction was made a year
or two ago, when the original Superannuation
Bill was passed. The question does not affect
the present Bill. I am only drawing my honourable friend's attention to it.
Hon. Mr. REID: I would like to mention
another matter in connection with Civil Service superannuation. It does not refer to
this particular clause, with which I am in
accord. I noticed in the press a short time
ago that certain representations had been
made by a deputation representing widows of
superannuated Civil Servants. Many of these
dependents have been left without adequate
means of support, and some have had to go
into homes for the aged. Under the present
superannuation law which we passed about a
year ago, the widow of a superannuated Civil
Servant receives an allowance; but in the
case of a superannuated Civil Servant who
died before that statute was passed, even if
only a few months before, his widow gets
nothing.
I would ask the honourable Minister to give
consideration to cases of this kind and see
if something cannot be done. I think that
in almost every case it will be found that
the deceased Civil Servant has left very little
estate. I know of several cases of real hardship at the present time. It would not require much to assist these dependents for the
few years they have yet to live.
I will transHon. Mr. DANDIURAND:
mit the remanks of my honourable friends
from Assiniboia (Hon. Mr. Turriff) and
Grenville (Hon. Mr. Reid) to the Acting
Minister of Finance and to the Superintendent of Insurance, who is, I think, charged

events has had a great deal to do with the
drafting of it.

SENATE
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
CONSIDERED IN

COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Robertson in the Chair.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Subsection 2 of section 10 of the Act reads as follows:
No contributor shall be retained in the Civil Service
eyoînd the age of seventy years; provided, however,
:hat if the deputy head of any departmoent reports,
within three months after the ccming into force of
this Act, in respect of anv contributor in such department wlo, whether before or after the coming into
force of this Act, attains the age of seventy years, oz
not less than thirty days before the attainnent of the
said age by any contri1butor, that on accourt of his
peculiar efficiency and fitness for his position the continuance in office of such contributor beyond the sa:d
age is in the public interest. . . .

One of the leading Civil Servants here has
represented to me that the provisions of this
subsection are unreasonable. My honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) is having the
Act amended by extending to two years the
time in which a Civil Servant may elect to
become a contributor to the Superannuation Fund. It has been suggested to me that
we ought to amend subsection 2 of section
10 by extending the period in which the
Deputy Head of a Department may recomrmend the Civil Servant's continuance in
office. As the subsection makes provision for
the retention of a contributor up to the age
of seventy-five, it would not be unreason-able to say that the Deputy Head of the
Department should have the right to recommend his retention within two years after the
coming into force of the Act, which was in
1924.
That would
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
give another year.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The period
was limited to three months.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It was
Jimited to the three months, but in the latter
part of the subsection the time mentioned is
thirty days. That is a very short period for a
man to make preparations to retire from the
Public Service. Inasmuch as the matter of
making the recommendation rests with the
Deputy Head, it seems to me that the public
interest cannot possibly suffer if the time is
extended. The amendment has been subm:tted to me, and I will hand it to the Chairman.
Hoh.

Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It looks somewhat involved. The period allowed has expired.
May I suggest to my honourable
friend that, if no interests will suffer, we
might treat this proposed amendment as we
treated the last Bill. It could be taken up
at another time. I oonfess that I cannot
grasp its exact purport.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I cannot
speak with confidence on it. I must confess
I am not familiar with the intricacies of this
Act. The amendment can be moved on the
third reading. In the meantime my bonourable friend may make inquiries as to
whether this is a desirable amendment or
not.
The preamble and the title were agreed to.
The Bill was reported without amendment.
RAILWAY EXPENDITURE
CONDUCT

OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE

Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen. there is a small matter that I would like
to call to the attention of the House. There
seemns to be some misunderstanding in another place as to the reason why our Special
Committee to inquire into railway expenditure sat in camera and why we do not report
the evidence. When that Committee was
appointed and constituted I think it was
thoroughly understood by all its members
that the subject to be dealt with was very

important and very large; and, as I under-

stand it, the Committee determined that .in-

stead of going into small details they would
deal with the larger issue. In order to do
that, we determined that it would be wise to
sit in camera and not report the evidence.
We have explained our reasons for that in
the reports itself, which perhaps ought to be
sufficient for people who wish to understand
it.
La-st night I explained again that if a man
were making a statement on the railway situation, which is a very complicated one, with
the knowledge that his statement would be
published and discussed all over the country,
he would find it necessary, in order to protect
himself, to make reservations, explanations,
and distinct qualifications which, from the
point of view of the Committee, would in
themselves be relatively unimportant. What
we wanted to do was to get at the pith and
the heart of the railway situation, and not
at the small details. For that reason the
Committee concluded that we would sit in
camera, and that there would be no report of
the evidence. I assume full responsibility for
that, so far as one man can assume responsi-

proposed, there is no doubt that it will ray
so, as we have no pride in regard to the
recommendation we make, but we have a
one'ness of purpose, which is to find the solution that will appeal to the general public
and to the sober-minded men of this country.
What I said more than once in the
Committee I desire to repeat now, so that
members of the other Bouse may read if,
that ýthere is in Great Britain a Cornrittee
which meets to consider matters of national
importance, where party passions and conflicts
do flot enter: it is the Committee on Noitional
Defeice. I understand. that, thai Committee
is coirnposed of ithe leaders of aII parties in
the British Bouse of Gommons. They meet
together so tha-t they may bear joint responsibilitty for the detfence of the riealm, and in, order

SPEtOH FROM TEEF THRONE

After which the RiÀght Honourable the
Deputy of the Governor General was pleased
to close the Fourth Session of the Fourteenth
Parliamnent of the Domninion of Canada with
the following speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the flouse of Comnions:
In bringing to a close the Fourth Session of the
Fourteenth Parliament of Canada, 1 desire to, express
te you rny appreciation of the rare and attention givan
the many importànt mensures which hava corne before
you for consideration.
It is gratîfying to observe that the trade of ocr
country is expanding as at ne previous period of its
history. The favourable balance for the fiscal year
ended Mai-ch Blet excaeded 284 millions cf dollars.
This expansion will without doulit bie further stimulated by the inter-Imperial agi-berent negotiated with
oui- sister Dominion, Australia, te which. approval has
just been given, and by the legislation enacted for
the purpose cf establishing most favoured nation trade
relations wîth Finland and the Netherlands, including
the populous and wesithy Islands cf the Dutch East
Indice.
Delegates from, the British West Indies are at pi-ssent
confarring with my Govei-nment concarning racipi-ocal
development cf trade and the improeament of communications throughout British Amierica.
Canadien ti-ade, via Canadien perts, has beau
gi-aatly developadl under the policy of allowing additional pi-afarence upon commodities when imported
thi-ougli Canadian ports fi-cm countries enjoying the
Britishi Preference. Pi-actîcally the entire importations
of British goods enjeying a preference now enter
Canada through Canadien ports.

7N'

To provide moi-e adequate facilitias for our increasing orean-bomae traffic, provision bas bean made for
improving the equipment of our national harbours.
A Special Committee cf the flousa of Commons,
appointed earlY in the session to considar a proposai
to bring about the lowering cf Nor-th Atlantic freigbt
rates, lias recently reported, confirming the existence
cf a combine and the neceesity for the establishment
cf an effective control over Ocean Ratas. This important subi ect will continua to engage the attention
cf my advisers.
The intricate problemn cf the i-egulation cf railway
freight ratas thi-ouglieut Canada bas beau dealt with
in a mannar which it is believed will enable the Board
cf Railway Commissioners te present a rata structure,
basud upen an aqualization of rates as between provinces and localities, that will ha fair and just te al
parts cf Canada, and whîch should serve further te
stimulete bath domestic and foi-aigu trade.
A consolidation and revision cf the Canada Grain
Act has bsec made, which should prove cf direct and
substantial benefit to the great agricultural industry
of the country.
Rigorous enactments bava been passed to aid in the
prevention of smuggling and the enforcemnent cf oct
revenue laws. They hava beau supplemented by important treaties with the United States respecting the
suppression cf smuggling, and of ti-affie in narcotics.
Agreements have also beau concludad with the
United States for the final demarcaticu cf the international boundary lina and the regulation cf the levai
cf the Lakte cf the Woods.
Amandmaents ta, the Industrial Disputes Investigation
Art, the Soldiea' Seutlement Act, and the Dominion
Elections Act, have been among other important auactments cf the uesion.
Membars cf the House cf Commons:
I thank you for the provision you hava made for
the public service.
Honourable Members cf the Senate:
Members cf the Hlouse cf Cemmnons:
The numerous evidences of inc-eesing pi-osperity are
now happily supplemautedl by the prospect cf a
bountiful harvest. For these and other blessings I
humbly join with you in thanksgiving to Divine
Providence.
