OFFICIAL REPORT

THE SENATE
Thursday, November 20, 1952
The Parliament of Canada having been
summoned by Proclamation of the Governor
General to meet this day for the dispatch of
business:
The Senate met at 2.30 p.m., the Speaker
in the Chair.
OPENING OF THE SESSION
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that he had received a communication from
the Governor General's Secretary informing
him that His Excellency the Governor General
would arrive at the Main Entrance of the
Houses of Parliament at 3 p.m., and, when
it had been signified that all was in readiness,
would proceed to the Senate Chamber to open
the Seventh Session of the Twenty-first Parliament of Canada.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
At three o'clock His Excellency the
Governor General proceeded to the Senate
Chamber and took his seat upon the Throne.
His Excellency was pleased to command the
attendance of the House of Commons, and that
House being come, with their Speaker, His
Excellency was pleased to open the Seventh
Session of the Twenty-first Parliament of
Canada with the following speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
You resume your labours on behalf of the Canadian people at a time of continuing international
tension.
Nevertheless, because of the steadfast
resistance of our Canadian forces and their comrades in arme to aggression in Korea and because
of the increasing strength of the forces of freedom
in Europe, there are signs of a léssening of the
danger of an outbreak of war on a global scale.
My ministers are convinced that a lasting peace
can be assured only so long as the combined
strength of the free world continues to be built up
and maintained.
The sacrifices of. those directly involved in the
United Nations police action in Korea and the
anxieties of their families are an inevitable and
most regrettable part of the price we are paying to
prevent another world war.

To meet our nation's international responsibilities
certain of my ministers are attending the seventh
session of the General Assembly of the United
Nations.
Because of the continued international tension
you will be asked to approve legislation providing
for the continuation of the Emergency Powers Act
and you will also be asked to provide for the
appointment of an Associate Minister of National
Defence.
My Prime Minister and my Minister of Finance
will attend a meeting of the prime ministers of
the commonwealth to open in London later this
month to consider important economic and monetary problems.
Her Majesty the Queen has been pleased to set
June the second next as the date of her coronation.
Arrangements will be made for Canadian representation at the ceremonies and plans are being
formulated for the celebration in Canada of this
historic event.
Canada has been blessed this year with a record
grain crop.
Our economic conditions remain favourable and
the level of external trade is high. While the
dangers of inflation have not disappeared, pressures
have eased and it has been possible to suspend the
operation of some of the anti-inflationary measures.
Under an amendment to the income tax regulations the provisions for deferred depreciation which
have been in effect since April 11, 1951, will not
apply to property acquired after December 31, 1952,
nor to taxation years commencing after that date.
Early in 1953 negotiations will be carried on in
Washington for a new international wheat agreement to replace the existing agreement which expires on July 31 next. You will be asked to consider amendments to the Canadian Wheat Board
Act.
The international joint commission has issued an
order of approval for the development of hydroelectric power in the international section of the
St. Lawrence river.
Because of this latest step the Canadian government has informed the government of the United
States it considers that the agreement made in 1941
in respect of the St. Lawrence seaway has been
superseded.
Pending the establishment of the St. Lawrence
seaway authority, an engineering planning staff has
been set up in Montreal to begin work on detailed
plans for the seaway, and the Gut Dam in the river
near Iroquois is now being removed.
You will be asked to make financial provision for
certain improvements to Vancouver harbour and
for engineering studies of that harbour and of other
possible improvements to navigation on the Pacific
coast. You will also be asked to make further provision for the Canso causeway, the ferry service
from North Sydney to Port aux Basques and the
terminal facilities at Port aux Basques, and the new
ferry service between Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, and
Bar Harbor, Maine.
You will be invited to consider a measure to
provide for federal co-operation with the provincial governments in the conservation of the water
resources of Canada.
- To give effect to recommendations made by the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce at

SENATE
the last session of parliament and to extend its
scope your approval will be sought for an amend-

You will also be asked to consider legislation to
implement the International Convention for the

Provision has been made for the insertion in all
federal government contracts of clauses prohibiting
discrimination on the part of the contractor against
any person in regard to employment because of
that person's race, national origin, colour or religion.
You will be asked to consider a bill to make
similar provisions in respect of employment upon
or in connection with any work, undertaking or
business that is within the legislative authority of
the parliament of Canada.
A bill designed to provide greater educational
opportunities for children whose fathers died as a
result of war service will be placed before you.
You will also be asked to approve a bill to authorize the continuance of the Veterans Benefit Act.
Much has been accomplished since the inauguration in 1948 of the five year national health grants
program to strengthen and improve, in co-operation
with the provincial governments, the health and
hospital facilities available to our people. To ensure
the continued expansion of this important work,
my government proposes to ask you to give consideration to the extension, with certain changes,
of this program of co-operation with the provincial governments.
You will have learned with regret that the Library
of Parliament has been damaged by fire. The building must soon be vacated and extensive reconstruction carried out, in order to guard against a repetition of this disaster. These circumstances have
made the need for a National Library more immediate and more pressing. My ministers have therefore taken steps to bring the library into existence
with the least possible delay. A site for the building has been chosen, and you will be asked to
make provision for the necessary planning and
preliminary work.
At the time television broadcasting was started in
Toronto and Montreal in September, the Prime
Minister announced that parliament would be asked
to provide for the establishment of three additional
public television stations, one in the Maritimes,
one on the Prairies and one on the Pacific coast
and that active consideration was being given to
the role of private enterprise in television broadcasting.
You will accordingly be asked to make provision
to enable the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to
establish television stations in the Halifax, Winnipeg and Vancouver areas. My ministers have indicated t the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that
they are now prepared to consider applications for
licences for private television broadcasting stations
which may be recommended by the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation to serve areas which
could not be served at this time by public stations,
with the objective of making television as widely
available throughout the country as may be feasible
through appropriate co-operation between the corporation and private agencies.
A measure will be submitted designed to place
the Crown in substantially the same position as a
private person with respect to liability for acts
committed by its servants, for breach of duty arising out of the ownership or occupation of property,
and for salvage claims, and also to confer upon
provincial courts jurisdiction concurrent with that
of the Exchequer Court of Canada to entertain
certain classes of claims.
Measures respecting the payment of rural mail
carriers will be submitted for your consideration.
To meet conditions resulting from the entry of
the province of Newfoundland into confederation,
and the introduction of new methods of fishing off
the Atlantic coast, a bill to revise the Customs and
Fisheries Protection Act will be placed before you.

place the Historic
A bill will be introduced t
Sites and Monuments Board of Canada on a statutory basis.
The measure to revise and consolidate the
Criminal Code will be re-introduced at this session.
You will be asked to consider legislation to amend
the Trust Companies Act and the Loan Companies
Act to authorize companies incorporated thereunder
to invest in bonds issued by the International Bank
for Reconstruction and Development.
You will also be asked to consider legislation to
provide for the incorporation by Parliament and for
federal supervision of co-operative credit societies
desiring to operate in more than one province under
such legislation.
You will be asked to consider revisions of the
Civil Service Superannuation Act; the Food and
Drugs Act; the Yukon Act; and the legislation
respecting Trade Marks.
Other measures to be introduced will include
amendments to the Trans-Canada Air Lines Act,
the Merchant Seamen Compensation Act, the Canadian Citizenship Act, the Statistics Act, the Indian
Act, the Farm Improvement Loans Act, the Prisons
and Reformatories Act, the Companies Creditors
Arrangement Act, the Canada Evidence Act, the
Judges Act, the Canada Shipping Act, the Civil
Service Insurance Act, the Canadian Overseas Telecommunication Corporation Act and to the Territorial Lands Act.
Members of the House of Commons:
You will be asked to make provision for all
essential services, and for national defence and the
meeting of our obligations under the United Nations
Charter and the North Atlantic Treaty, during the
next fiscal year.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
May Divine Providence bless your deliberations.

The House of Commons withdrew.
His Excellency the Governor General was
pleased to retire.
The sitting of the Senate was resumed.
Prayers.

BILL

FIRST READING

Hon. Mr. King (for Hon. Mr. Robertson)
presented Bill A, an Act relating to railways.

The bill was read the first time.
COMMITTEE ON ORDERS
AND PRIVILEGES
MOTION OF APPOINTMENT
Hon. Mr. King (for Hon. Mr. Robertson)
with leave of the Senate moved:
That all the senators present during this session
be appointed a committee to consider the orders
and customs of the Senate and privileges of parliament, and that the said committee have leave to
meet in the Senate Chamber when and as often
as they please.

The motion was agreed to.

NOVEMBER 20, 1952
COMMITTEE OF SELECTION
MOTION OF APPOINTMENT

Hon Mr. King (for Hon. Mr. Robertson):
Honourable senators, with leave of the Senate
I would move:
That pursuant to Rule 77, the following senators,
to wit: The Honourable Senators Aseltine, Beaubien, Gouin, Haig, Hugessen, McDonald, Quinn,
Robertson and Taylor be appointed a Committee
of Selection to nominate senators to serve on the
several Standing Committees during the present
session; and to report with all convenient speed the
names of the senators so nominated.

The motion was agreed to.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR CONSIDERATION

Hon. Mr. King (for Hon. Mr. Robertson)
moved that the Speech of His Excellency the
Governor General delivered this day to the
Houses of Parliament be taken into consideration on Monday next.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: Does that mean that
we are to meet on Monday?
Hon. Mr. King: I shall deal with that when
I move the motion for adjournment.
The motion was agreed to.
ADJOURNMENT-MONDAY

SITTING

Hon. Mr. King (for Hon. Mr. Robertson)
moved that when the Senate adjourns today
it stand adjourned until Monday evening next
at 8 o'clock.

Hon. Mr. Marcotte: Honourable senators, I
have some objection to that. As you know,
the banks are now closed on Saturday.
Usually the Senate does not meet on Monday
and we can do our business with the banks on
that day, but now you are trying to take
that day away from us. I do not see why
there is this rush to get started here on a
Monday. We have never done that before
so early in the session. It is not customary
for the Senate to meet on Monday until we
are near the end of the session. I am a businessman, you are a businessman, and there
are other businessmen here. Let us have
at least one free day in the week in which
to do business with the banks.
Hon. Mr. King: I am sure that my honourable friend's objection will be noted, but I
suggest that we might discuss it at a more
opportune time.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: But there will not be
another opportunity if this motion to adjourn
until Monday is carried.
Hon. Mr. King: I have moved the motion.
Some Hon. Senators: Carried!
The motion was agreed to.

The Senate met at 8 p.m., the Speaker in

Prayers and routine proceedings.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
before we proceed with any further matters
I should perhaps make a brief explanation of
the business to come before the house at this
sitting.
Contrary to our general practice of adjourning on the opening day of the session until
the following Tuesday, I asked the honourable
senator from Kootenay East (Hon. Mr. King)
to move on my behalf on Thursday afternoon
last that the house be adjourned until this
evening at 8 o'clock. I made that suggestion
because there is a large volume of legislation ready to be presented; indeed, I believe
that the fourteen bills which I shall place
before the house tonight constitute a record
in volume of legislation te be introduced so
early in a session. Some of these measures
are very important and warrant as much
time and consideration as honourable senators will be able to give them. It is for that
reason that I am presenting them at the
earliest possible moment. Two of them were
previously before us. Honourable senators
will recall that last session a considerable
amount of work was done on the Criminal
Code Bill, but it was decided that the measure
should not be dealt with at that time. A new
bill is to be introduced this evening. Honourable senators will recall also that a bill to
revise the Food and Drugs Act was introduced
last session, but merely for the purpose
of giving it distribution. It is again being
brought forward, with the idea that we shall
consider it here during this session and, I
assume, hold hearings on it in committee. As
I am anxious to make as rapid progress with
these particular measures as is consistent
with proper consideration of them, I will ask
that they be given second reading tomorrow.
In the case of the other bills, there will be
the customary forty-eight hours' notice, so
they will not be dealt with before Wednesday.
Further, with a view to facilitating early
reference of these bills to committee, if they
receive second reading, I should like to have
certain standing committees set up as soon
as possible.
With that object in view I
suggested today to the Selection Committee
that they present this evening an interim
report concerning three standing committees
namely, Banking and Commerce, to which

ordinarily the Criminal Code Bill would be
referred; Public Health and Welf are, to which,
I suggest, the Food and Drugs Bill be sent,
if it obtains second reading; and Standing
Orders, which it is necessary to bring into
existence as soon as possible because there
are two or three private bills requiring early
consideration.
In due course, when the order is called,
the Chairman of the Selection Committee
will propose the adoption of the interim report
on these three committees.
A considerable number of places remain to
be filled on each of these committees. On
Banking and Commerce, for instance, ten
appointments remain to be made: they consist of two vacancies, in vny event; and there
are eight senators, members of the committee
last session, who during the last twentythree sittings of the committee attended either
no meeting at all or only one, and whose
names have been omitted from the list. I
have suggested, however, that if any of these
senators desire to serve this year and are able
to do so, they shall have prior consideration
for the vacant appointments. Similarly, there
are ten vacancies on Public Health and Welfare which may be filled by any senators who
care to act on that committee.
With that explanation, may I suggest that
the Senate consider passing the interim report
this evening, so that the three committees
may be organized tomorrow and be ready to
deal with the bills mentioned if the Senate
sees fit to give them second reading.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: A small number of
copies of the bill are available, and I am
hopeful that the supply will shortly meet
the demand.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I would also suggest to
the honourable leader of the government
that when copies become available they
should be distributed immediately to the
members of the special committee who
studied this bill last session. I understand
that some of the recommendations made have
been accepted, and if that is so a lot of time
can be saved by avoiding unnecessary discussion. Let the House of Commons do some
of the work. But I would suggest that the
honourable senators from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck), Vancouver South (Hon.
Mr. Farris), from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden)

NOVEMBER 24, 1952
-who is not here this evening-and Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard) be supplied as soon
as possible with advance copies. That would
facilitate matters very much.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I intend to ask my
colleague the Minister of Justice, when the
bill is before the Senate for second reading,
tomorrow or later, to come here and give us
the advantage of an explanation as to the
respects in which this bill differs from the
one which was introduced previously.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: If I may have
your indulgence, honourable senators, I
would suggest that we do not attempt to give
the Criminal Code second reading tomorrow.
The minister will be here. I am told that
some twenty-six of our suggestions have
been written into the text. I would like ta
check that matter, and also to have some
opportunity, after the minister has addressed
us, to comment on the bill in its present form.
I do not think we can pass it tomorrow, but it
is all right to have second reading moved then
and to hear what the minister has to say.
The bill was read the first time.
THE LATE SENATOR FOGO
TRIBUTES TO HIS MEMORY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Wishar McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, it is one of my official responsibilities from time to time to draw to the attention
of the house the loss of one or more of our
members. It is always a matter of regret, but
sometimes our sorrow is assuaged in part at
least by the realization that our colleague's
passing represents the termination of a long
career of usefulness in the service of his
fellow-men. On certain occasions, happily
less frequently, it becomes necessary for me
to draw attention to the f'act that, as a result
of the inscrutable ways of Providence, a
colleague has passed in the very prime of
life, one whose accomplishments gave every
promise that he had barely crossed the threshhold of a brilliant career of usefulness and
accomplishment. This I believe can be truly
said of the Honourable James Gordon Fogo,
Q.C., who died suddenly on July 6 last, at
Murray Bay, Quebec.
Senator Fogo was born at Halifax on July
9, 1896, the son -of Alice Hanway and Adam
G. Fogo, a locomotive engineer on the old
Intercolonial Railway.
The family later
moved to Sydney, Nova Scotia, where the late
senator left school at the age of sixteen te
work in the Dominion Steel plant. However,
he later finished his cou'rse at Sydney
Academy and went on to the provincial
Normal School.

He started teaching in a school in the coalmining town of Stellarton, at the age of 18;
but with the advent of the First World War
he enlisted as a private in the artillery and
served overseas for three years with the 2nd
Canadian Siege Battery. Upon his return
home, in 1919, he resumed teaching, this time
in Sydney High School, and the following
year went to Amherst where he articled with
his mother's brother, J. A. Hanway, Q.C.,
whose partner at that time was the late
Colonel James Layton Ralston. In 1921 he
entered Dalhousie University to study law,
and upon being called to the Bar, in 1924,
he joined Colonel Ralston and the Honourable Charles Burchell in their Halifax law
office, becoming a member of the firm in
1926, when Colonel Ralston came to Ottawa
to be appointed Minister of Defence.
Brilliantly successful as a lawyer, he attracted the attention of the Right Honourable
C. D. Howe, who, as Minister of the Department of Munitions and Supply, in 1942 invited
him to come to Ottawa as Associate Coordinator of Controls in that department. He
became one of the government's ace troubleshooters on the production side of the war
effort, specia.lizing in labour problems. Later
he became Executive Vice-President of the
Algoma Steel Corporation and maintained an
office in Ottawa, where he set up a liaison
between that corporation and the federal
government, specializing in questions affecting labour. In addition to these activities his
wide experience and valuable counsel gained
him a place on many important directorates
closely concerned with the industrial development of this country.
On the political side he maintained an
unswerving devotion and loyalty to the Liberal party from his youth. His first political
encounter came in 1920, when he went on
the hustings in support of Colonel Ralston's
attempt to gain a Cumberland County seat in
the Nova Scotia legislature.. The late senator
continued ta maintain an active interest in
the Nova Scotia Liberal organization, and,
although he never ran for public office 11imself, his qualities of leadership and political
judgment were generally felt in the direction
of the organization's affairs. From 1939 to
1941, when he was president of the Nova
Scotia Liberal Association, he gained a wealth
of experience which proved invaluable when,
in 1945, he was drafted by the National Liberal Federation to organize the successful
Liberal campaign in the federal election of
that year. Some months later he was elected
president of that organization.
His greatest political task, however, was
organizing the National Liberal Convention
in Ottawa in the summer of 1948, at which
convention the present Prime Minister was

BENATE
chosen as leader of the party. In the following
year our late colleague was appointed to the
Senate, where, as honourable senators know,
his keen intellect and sound judgment made
an indelible impression on those privileged
to be associated with him.
The happy associations that I have formed
with all honourable senators since I have
been privileged to be a member of this
house make it difficult to draw distinctions.
I may be pardoned, however, in the case of
Senator Fogo, since my association with him
extended over a very long period. I treasured
our association over these years more than
I can say. Gordon Fogo, as a friend and
confidant, possessed to an extraordinary
degree the characteristics of kindness and
loyalty. As an adviser his judgment was
unerringly sound and selfless. I, together
with hosts of other friends, watched with
pride the steady and rapid progress be made
in every line of endeavour with whicb he
was connected. I, with them, was concerned
lest the growing load of responsibility should
unduly tax his health and strength, a danger
of which there had from time to time been
some indication. I, with them, had hoped
against hope that his quiet manner, his keen
mind and his ready humour would enable him
to -surmount all his responsibilities for many
years to come. But it was not to be, and
his death occurred shortly after the adjournment in last July. There passed from our
midst a colleague loved and respected by all
that knew him.
May I extend to his widow and children
our deepest sympathy in their great sorrow.
May I say to his widow-and I am sure
others join me-that her late husband had
achieved the stature of a distinguished Canadian and a great man; and to his son and
daughter, that their father's memory will
long be treasured by those who were privileged to know, love and respect him.
Hon. John T. Haig: lonourable senators,
after listening to the remarks of the leader
of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) I feel
that I can hardly add anything. I did not
know the late Gordon Fogo until he entered
this chamber, but during our association here
I came to know him quite well. I sometimes felt that be was working too hard. He
would seem to hold up as though be did not
want to press something further because it
was taxing his energy.
This bouse and Canada can ill afford to
lose men like Gordon Fogo. Our need for
men of his type is greater now than ever
before. It is indeed a great loss to the whole
country that a man so valuable to our public
life should pass away at such a relatively
young age.

I wish to extend to his widow and family
my most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.

Thei

loss

hardly be realized by those of us who are
older and who have had our loved ones
around us for a longer period.
The late Senator Fogo was an eminent
lawyer who went about his Senate duties
in a quiet way. As a new member of the
Senate be may not have taken too prominent
a part in our debates, but in committee it
was realized that be had a wide knowledge of
the subjects with which be dealt, and some
of us found it difficult to oppose his views.
On behalf of the party which I have the
honour to lead and of the people from my
part of Canada, I join the leader of the government in paying tribute to the memory of
this native son of Nova Sceotia who was
loved and held in such high esteem by all
Canadians.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable senators, on behalf of those of us who are designated as representatives of the province of
Ontario, I should like to pay deep and warm
respect to the memory of our late-departed
colleague, Senator Fogo.
Senator Fogo made his home in Ontario,
an adopted son from Nova Scotia-more particularly, from Cape Breton. He was a valuable acquisition to our representation from
Ontario in this chamber, and in the relatively
short period of time that be lived in Ottawa
he made a wide and warm circle of friends.
He was a man who made friends very easily.
Indeed, I have never seen such a spirit of
camaraderie and friendship as be evoked
among people of all classes. There was
about Gordon Fogo a quiet reserve, a lack of
ostentation, which was deceptive. He had a
good sense of humour and an unpretentious
manner, but carried a competent and clearheaded view of any task to which he might
turn his mind. In one way or another I had
come in close contact with him in the last
ten years. He had a marked capacity for
business affairs, in which he had firmly established himself in recent years. He had also
established a reputation for himself at the
Bar in Ottawa and before the Supreme Court
of Canada.
Gordon Fogo had real fortitude and courage.
He knew well what he was faced with. His
passing, which came all too soon, was largely
a result of his refusal to take things easily
and lead a life of leisure. It was his definite

continue to pursue what he considered to be

adopted the motion that the report of the

the procedure we might follow in order that
the members of the Divorce Com"mittee may

to allow the report of the Committee of Selection to stand for one day before being considered, so that honourable senators may

IN REPLY

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
His Excellency the Governor General's speech
at the opening of the Seventh Session of the
Twenty-First Parliament of Canada.
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri moved:
That the following Address be presented to His
Excellencv the Governor General of Canada:
To His Excellency the Right Honourable Vincent
Massey Meinber of the Order of the Companions of
Honour, Governor General and Commander-inChief of Canada.
May it Please Your Excellency:
We, Her Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Senate of Canada, in parliament assembled. beg leave to offer our humble thanks to Your
Excellency for the gracious speech which Your
Excellency has addressed to both houses of parliament.

He said:
(Translation):
My first words are for our gracious queen,
to whom I wish a long and fruitful reign.
May her coronation, next June, be the beginning of an era of peace and prosperity, not
only for the whole Commonwealth, but for
the entire world.
May God watch over the Queen! God save
the Queen!
To His Honour the Speaker, I wish to present my respects. I hope he will continue to
preside over our proceedings with his customary wisdom.
I also wish to pay tribute to the two leaders
and assure them of my respect. To the leader
of this side of the chamber I wish health
and vigour, so that he may continue in the
active direction of our work, as he has done

NOVEMBER 25, 1952
in the past. As to the leader opposite, I hope
he will continue to perform his duty as
critic as he has up till now, that is, in a
constructive manner.
I cannot fail to mention the loss of one
of our good friends, the late Senator Fogo.
He passed away at an early age and very
suddenly. His loss is perhaps more deeply felt
by me than by many others, because he was
my neighbour in this chamber. I was aware
of his knowledge and consulted him often in
order to get a better understanding of certain
points of law which a layman sometimes bas
difficulty in grasping. I wish to extend to his
family my most sincere and deepest sympathy.
I am happy to greet my colleagues who
return invigorated to take up anew the task
of working harder than ever for a great
cause: the advancement, the greatness and
the prosperity of our country.
With reference to the neqph frnm the
throne which affords me tbe honour of being
axong the first to be called ta speak in this
new session, I shall not attempt to analyse
in detail every subject mentioned therein.
I shall comment on certain points which are
connected therewith directly or indirectly.
My speecb wtbaater
on urincinles. It
is omÎetimes said of speeches made in reply
to the speech from the throne that they are
gone with the wind. Nevertheless, if the
remarks inspired by it could do no more than
awaken some ideas that may bear fruit in
a year or two, the time spent in making them
would not be lost. I believe such remarks
are necessary and that the authorities sometimes pay attention to them.
One of the greatest concerns of every citizen is taxation. Some claim that it is so
heavy, and the cost of living is so high, that
they can no longer buy what they need.
Others maintain that expenditures are excessive, or else that social security legislation
is too costly, or else that defence expenditures
should not be so great.
On the other hand, some people would like
the government to spend more money for
defence preparation; they feel that we have
not gone far enough in that direction. Others
claim that social security legislation is not
adequate; that old age pensions should be
increased to sixty dollars a month, that family
allowances might be more generous, as well
as pensions to the blind, to war veterans, etc.
If they are placed in power, they say, they
will give more and tax less. By what means
would they work out such a miracle? To
spend more and tax less! Let those understand who can. Finally, others belleve that
in printing more paper money all expendi-

tures could be paid without any burden
being placed upon the taxpayer. Such a system was tried out in France once upon a
time, when the government issued assignats.
After a few months' trial the whole economy
of the country collapsed completely, which
was oneof the causes of the revolution. How
can the mere fact of printing on a piece of
paper the figures $1, $2 or $20 give any value
to such money?
Another means which is often suggested to
the government is to borrow. Indeed, I read
in a newspaper a few days ago: "Why not
decrease taxation and borrow money-borrow
a billion a year, for instance". People seem
to believe that when you borrow there is no
obligation to repay or to pay interest. Are
they aware that when borrowing at 3j or 4
per cent, in a very few years the capital is
doubled simply because of the interest? If
we should resort to such steps, future generations would be in debt for many decades.
Not that all capital expenditures should be
paid for from one year to the next, but as far
as social security expenditures are concerned,
it seems to me that, from an economic point
of view, they should be paid each year.
It is also said: "Why spend so much on
defence?" But when the war broke out in
1939, how many of our people reproached
England and France for not having prepared
themselves. Some cannot see why we in
Canada should spend our money uselessly,
when there is no immediate danger of being
attacked. Germany had armed herself, had
prepared for war, but we had done nothing
or very nearly. Let us read Churchill's
Memoirs. The war lasted five years and
caused an orgy of expenditure and slaughter.
Today, we see what the communists are doing,
what they are preparing, what they are
striving for. Let us not close our eyes: they
are going through the very same gestures as
Hitler did, with this difference, that Stallin has
a genius for evil, while Hitler was unbalanced.
But people do not seem to realize what harm
would befall our country if we failed to take
immediately the means to protect ourselves, to
defend our country, and to show our opponents the strength which would be at our
disposal and which we could use against them.
A few years ago, in a little village that I
know very well, some progressive aldermen
wanted to set up a fire protection system. But
the village people protested: "Why make
such an expenditure? There has never been
a conflagration in our village; it · was
never burned down". But one fine day,

SENATE
a fire broke out in a small shop and the whole
village was destroyed. How many of them
were sorry then that they had not taken
advantage of the protection which the mayor
wanted to insure for the village! That mayor
had been defeated at the polls because he
wanted to give the locality a fire protection
system. They had even lost a small industry,
established in the village, but which moved
elsewhere so that its operations might be
protected against fire. Today the village is
being rebuilt and it now sees the necessity for
such protection, and is taking the proper
measures. Those citizens are now paying large
sums, but a little belatedly.
It is always thus. It is also claimed that
the Russians will never attack us here. They
will surely not come if we prepare ourselves,
if we are on the lookout and ready to defend
ourselves against the very first attack. But
if we do nothing they will come here, just
as they went into other countries where they
were sure to win.
I am all for reasonable taxation and for
proper remedies where expenditures are
excessive. But I sincerely believe that everything is being done to curb abuses or extravagance. The government has not hesitated to
sue those who thought they could rob the
treasury brazenly. Let us remember that if
each one paid his whole share, taxes would be
cut in two. According to surveys conducted
by our organization in certain districts,
we have come to the conclusion that if each
one of us paid what he should pay, taxes
could be reduced by 40 per cent. The middle
class is made up for the most part of civil
servants, called white-collar men. They pay
their whole share; but among the others,
there are many who try by every possible
means to evade taxation, if not to cheat on
taxation, because they do not understand
that what they fail to pay, their neighbour
will have to pay. Not only is it an injustice,
but it is robbery not to pay one's taxes. I
fail to grasp how those who maintain the
contrary understand justice and fairness
because, as I have already said, what the
tax evader does not pay, his neighbour will
have to pay.
On the subject of taxation, I would like
to mention another point. For some time,
I have been receiving many requests to quote
the sections of the British North America
Act dealing with the powers of taxation of
the federal and provincial governments.

As I am no jurist, I will refrain from going
into the finer points, but simply quote what
the British North America Act provides, in
sections 91 and 92, with respect to the legislative powers of Canada and of the provinces.
Article 91 of the British North America Act
reads as follows:
Legislative power of the Parliament
It shall be lawful for the Queen, by and with the
advice and consent of the Senate and House of
Commons, to make laws for the peace, order and
good government of Canada, in relation to all
matters not coming within the classes of subjects
by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures
of the provinces, and for greater certainty, but not
so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing
terms in this section, it is hereby declared that
(notwithstanding anything in this Act) the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of
Canada extends to all matters coming within the
classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated;
that is to say,3. The raising of money by any mode or system
of taxation.

As to the provinces, section 92 provides as
follows:
Exclusive powers of provincial Legislatures
In each province the legislature may exclusively
make laws in relation to matters coming within the
classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated;
that is to say:
2. Direct taxation within the province for the
raising of a revenue for provincial purposes.

I have only one remark to add: we all
know the integrity, truthfulness and great
honesty of the Prime Minister of Canada.

Inflation is still a subject of conversation.
Last year, in order to control inflation as
much as possible, the Government issued
orders restricting credit. There was a gen-

eral outcry. The Government wanted to place
fences to prevent the foolhardy from throwing
themselves into the pit, for was not the inflation of credit one of the causes of the 1929
depression?
At that time, everybody was
speculating, and paying for only 10 per cent of
the stocks they bought, while depending on
the future for the balance. The Government
was well advised, it seems to me, in restricting sales under the instalment plan, as I shall
try to demonstrate.

Credit restrictions were relaxed, early in
1952, and sales under the instalment plan more
than doubled during the second quarter of
this year. They increased from $150 million
to more than $335 million. Cash sales, however, increased but slightly during the same
quarter, from $1,989,800,000 to $2,015,900,000.

NOVEMBER 25, 1952
I was struck by another example, which is
even more concrete. At the Credit Union Federation in Quebec we compile statistics, from
which we have drawn the following facts.
In 1950, when credit was not under control,
for every dollar coming into our credit unions
during the year, there remained 2.5. In 1950,
when credit restriction were applied, for every
dollar coming into our credit unions, there
remained 4.4. As to the difference between
urban, semi-urban and rural centres, these
were the results: in urban centres, for each
dollar coming into the credit unions in 1950,
there remained 4-4; in 1951, 4.9; in semiurban centres, in 1950, there remained for
each dollar coming into the credit unions,
1.8; in 1951, 2.9; and in rural centres, there
remained in 1950, 1-0 and in 1951, 4-3.
What has 1952 in store for us? There is no
telling. But the figures given show that credit
control ensures a certain stability. It is all
very well to criticize, but any government
that organizes and maintains stability in a
country is a good government, against which
it is useless to make unfounded criticism.
There is one class of people just now which
is faced with a rather distressing problem:
the farmers, particularly those of Eastern
Canada. Western farmers were fortunate in
having a bumper crop, about which I am
delighted. However, due to the American
embargo, the price of meat has fallen sharply,
the difference in price being proportionately
much less marked for the consumer than for
the producer. In certain places the prices of
beef and pork to the producer went down
50 per cent, but only 10 or 15 per cent to the
consumer.
Such conditions should be corrected. Distribution is much too costly, and I would add
that the consumer is paying too much to the
middleman.
Mr. J. E. Duchesne, president of the Apple
and Fruit Society of Quebec and manager of
the Fruit Division of the Federated Co-operative of Quebec, in an address given in
Montreal on September 5 last, had this to say

about the growing and marketing of apples:
Since the farmer now refuses to go around more
poorly dressed than the city worker and also
claims the right to enjoy the comforts of mechanization and electrification, people have no more pity
for him, but attack him. It should not be forgotten
however, that it is not he but the middleman who
gets the lion's share of the profits on the sale of
agricultural products.
The city consumer would
benefit very little from the farmer lowering his
prices. Are people aware, for instance, that he
gets $35 for a ton of tomatoes which are resold
in the city for $140 and even $160 in the form of
tomato juice?

That is an example, and not the only one.
Last year, consumers were paying potatoes
$4, $5 and even $8 a bag. But middlemen
paid the farmers $1.50 a bag for the same
produce. Farmers or potato growers who
belonged to co-operatives were more fortunate, as they managed to sell their crop for
$3 to $4 a bag.
During the winter of 1951 consumers paid
from 80 cents to 85 cents a pound for butter,
and even more in certain places. But buttermakers and producers had received an average of 58 cents to 65 cents a pound. Is that
not an unreasonable price spread.
The agricultural economist of the federal
government, in a periodical published by the
federal Department of Agriculture last June,
gives the result of an investigation made into
the spread between prices paid to the producer
and those paid by the consumer, in the case
of nine agricultural products, during the 19351951 period. The difference in question is
that between annual average prices and not
that between the maximum and minimum
prices paid for these products.
The products concerned in this investigation were: wheat flour, white bread, standard
beef, fluid milk, butter, ordinary processed
cheese, potatoes and canned tomatoes.
An analysis of these figures indicates that,
at the retail level, these items represent
nearly 50 per cent of a family's expenditure
for food.
The following is the table published by
the federal economist in the periodical of the
federal Department of Agriculture:

This means that in 1951 the average
sprani hetween the prices paid to the producer and the prices paid by the consumer
was 22.9 cents per pound for beef, 16 -2 cents
per dozen for eggs, 9-4 cents per quart for
milk, 19 cents per pound for butter, 21 -8
cents per half-pound for cheese and 25-7
cents per 15-pound bag for potatoes.
This margin reflects the charges of the
middlemen, which have increased steadily
since 1947. In 1951 this increase was more
than double that of the 1935-39 period.
I do not mean that this difference was
entirely absorbed by the middlemen. It must
be recognized that products are no longer
sold as in the past; today they are graded
and packed, transportation costs are much
higher than they were formerly; storage costs
must also be reckoned with. However, it is
a fact that the man who labours for months
in order to raise a crop, who pays for the
fertilizers, who does the ploughing and who
spends all his energy in order to make -his
land produce, hardly gets 50 per cent of the
price paid by the consumer; the balance is
absorbed by distribution costs.
May I express the wish that steps be taken
in order to reduce those heavy distribution
costs and to devise a system which would
protect both producer and consumer? The
producer should receive a profitable price,
so that he may not lose any money on his
produce, while the consumer should not pay
heavy distribution costs which only serve to
enrich middlemen. The best solution to the
problem would be the co-operative system
which, in regard to production, is the method
which treats the farmer most fairly. Others
hold the same views. Mr. Leland Olds, one
of the six members of the committee which,
at the request of President Roosevelt, made
a survey of the co-operative movement in
Europe in 1937, stated in his report:
The co-operative way of life is not entirely new,
although its application to modem production and
the marketing technique belong to our times; the
rural family which was self-sufficient before the
industrial revolution was essentially a co-operative
organization; the elements of the co-operative
undertaking . ., local and regional, existed in the
However, the industrial revolution
middle ages.
gradually whittled down co-operation. The number of services required increased, the volume of
consumer goods went up also, and people began to
buy on the market what was formerly produced
at home.
The co-operative movement would therefore
extend the co-operative way of life, which characterized the families of old, to the control of
marketing, thanks to family co-operative groups.
Formerly, the needs of the family determined and
balanced production. Likewise, the needs of the
members of modem co-operative societies control
and stabilize production.

The government or governments, by promoting co-operation to the utmost, will act
wisely. To those who might say that the
co-operative system is socialism, I shall reply

forthwith that they are mistaken. The cooperative system is based on family organization; the co-operative system is a larger
family where those who exercise the same
profession, the same trade, get together in
order to produce more profitably, deliver
goods of better quality, more carefully processed and in larger volume. Indeed, it must
be noted that the most rabid enemies of
co-operation are precisely the members of
trusts, of monopolies, those organizations
which disregard the producer and are intent
on getting the largest possible earnings for
capital. Why frown upon farmers when they
endeavour to set up co-operatives, when the
number of chain stores increases steadily;
when lawyers, notaries, physicians and labour
are forming their own unions and professional associations? That is another form of
co-operation to which no one can object. Why
then should not farmers have the right to
organize? Indeed, co-operation is not socialism. On the contrary, co-operation develops
in the individual a sense of responsibility; it
stimulates initiative, inasmuch as in the cooperative movement each is paid according to
his labour, according to his own efforts.
All governments should endeavour by
every means at their disposal to develop
co-operatives, especially in the field of production, in order to protect both the producer
and the consumer. I do not think that at
birth some are destined to become wealthy
tradesmen, influential professional men, etc.,
and that the farmer, alone, must toil.
Communism is a timely topic; in certain
quarters it is feared, and with reason. If we
wish to fight communism, let us render to
all the greatest measure of justice. The
co-operative system well understood and well
organized will render justice to all men, by
requiring each and everyone to do his share,
and to develop and perfect his own activities.
Before concluding my remarks on this subject, I shall warn my friends, the farmers, not
to be in too great a rush in disposing of all
their livestock at this time when prices are
temporarily depressed. As the hay crop
was plentiful in the East, it may be used to
continue to feed livestock on farms. If the
United States embargo is lifted next spring,
the market will become more steady and
the farmer will probably obtain better prices.
If livestock is disposed of now, there will
be a scarcity of meat when the embargo is
lifted; the consumer will suffer and the producer will not benefit. It is a danger against
which those farmers who would be tempted
to sell their stock at the present time must
be warned.

NOVEMBER 25, 1952
one of the capital achievements of the
Liberal government was its social security
program, inaugurated in 1927 with the old
age pension. Today we have not only the
old age pension, but the pension for the blind
and war vetçrans, family allowances, unemployment insurance, etc. These measures are
intended to ward off, if possible, econ<mnic
depressions ýsuch as th-at which started in
1929.
I arn happy to say that in the manner in
which the tax burden is distributed in order
to pay for social security, the Canadian system seems to be the simplest and the most
efficient in the -world. Ind.eed, it is my personal opinion that our method of raising
funds in ýorder to defray the cost of this
financial assistance is the most practical and
economical one, and the method which
cnsures the greatest efficiency.
In some countries, employees and employers
contribute to defray the cost of such pensions,
and contributions are not the same everywhere. They vary from one section of the
country to another and are subi ect to many
other considerations. Therefore, when a certain industry is not prosperous, collections
fall off and complications set in. Things are
different in this country. Inasmuch as al
the citizens contribute to the prosperity of
the -country, I think it is only meet and just
that ail should also contribute to the economic
security of those who are entitled to such
benefits.
In certain quarters, the government was
criticized for having granted a $40 a month
pension to every citizen, rich or poor, who
bas reached 70 years of age. Is this not the
fairest method? Indeed, in the .past when
the pension was paid only to the needy, a
large number of people became in need overnight and received sums to which, strictly
'speaking, they were not entitled. Moreover,
as the pension is granted to everyone who
reaches 70 years of age, how many false
statements are avoided! For that matter,
the person who bas a sufficient income, and
does not need the pension to live on, hands
it back through taxation; in this way everything is fair and square.
It is idle to think that such 'simple measures
wrnl solve ail the economic and social problems of the nation. No; the great law to
ensure security has always been and still is
the law of work and of thrift. If we ever
forget these great principles of work and
thrift, we shaîl meet with the sanie disaster
which befeil many peoples who disregarded
these two fundamental laws.
68112-3

The principies of these social security
measures are not new; they have existed for
hundreds, nay, thousands of years. Sucli
laws were in the statutes at the time of the
Roman empire. At one time, the Romans
were so prosperous that they decided n-ot to
work any longer. "Why work?" said they.
"Ail those peoples which we have subjugated
are paying us tribute; we have nothing else
to do 'but to eat and enjoy ourselves". And
from Caesar they demanded bread and games
-Panem et Circenses. No work, no thrift,
no provision for the future. That was the
beginning of the decline of the empire. One
hundred and fifty years later the Roman
empire feli, neyer to fise again. The Romans
were brought to their doom because they had
disregarded the law of work and had not
provided for the future. "Thou sh-aît earn
thy breadby the sweat of thy brow". Such
was the sentence of God after the disobedience
of Adam and Eve.
Social security provided for everyone and
managed by the government had deprived the
Romans of any initiative; social security,
which was thought to be perfect, had brought
about total insecurity. The reason for this
decline, for this moral decay, was that the
state had replaced the family; once the family
is destroyed, a nation can no longer survive.
The family, the backbone of the nation, must
not perish; on the contrary, we must strive
to maintain it; for its disappearance would
spell the ruin of the nation.
Will the experience of the past be a lesson
for the future? Shall we have the courage
to learn this lesson and put it into practice?
Social security based solely on. economic
and material security does flot suffice; to
material security must be added moral
security based on charity and love.
Moral security wil prevent material and
social security from being the ruination of
mankind. If they want to avoid the fate
of the Romans, Western people must give a
new life, new spiritual and moral concepts,
to their laws. Otherwise, those social security
measures will become social insecurity laws.
That does flot mean that social security
laws are unnecessary, although one can
hardly believe that, in 1952, people suifer
from hunger, and cold and worry over the
next day. But that is not enough; and despite
this legislation, however perfect it may be,
there wili always be homes where the necessary things of life are lacking. Such bardship will always come from the same causes:
lack of education, lack of foresight, lack of
work.

SENATE

No one or no people on earth can ensure
'qneil securitv in trying to give bread and
games to each and every one without exacting
anything in return. Bread and games cannot
lead to continual and permanent prosperity.
Work, foresight, peace in the home, the virtue
of charity practised among men, such are
the indispensable conditions which ensure
genuine security. Christ told us nearly two
thousand years ago, to love one another and
to help one another.
Without taking too much time, may I be
permitted to point out the material aspect
of social security which involves a moral
aspect as well.
Social security, as I said, is based first of
all upon family security. Without the family,
it would be useless to try to organize social
security on a stable basis. If the family
disappears, the nation will inevitably disappear. We want to check the spread of
atheistic principles. But we are wasting our
time, unless we take the proper means of
maintaining and developing family life. Is
not the family the nation in the bud? Is not
every citizen whose heart is in the right place
willing to lay down his life in the defence
of his country. It is the same in the family.
Each one of its members, if he has a home,
considers it as a small country which he is
ever ready to defend.
It is useless to think that laws can solve
all social problems and remove all unwholesome ideas. See what is happening: there
are many laws which punish robbery, gangsterism and every form of crime. But alas,
there have never been so many crimes or
criminals as today.
More and more hospitals are being built to
take care of people suffering from tuberculosis, cancer or heart disease, and to prevent
and cure physical ailments. Why should we
not endeavour with the same care to comfort
and protect a very sick patient, the family?
Would not one way of trying to cure many
of society's ailments be to endeavour to
see to it that every family has a home,
owns a bouse and a small plot of land which
become its own small country?
The speech from the throne indicates that
the houses of parliament will be called upon
to approve an amendment to the National
Housing Act. The National Housing Act,
since its enactment, bas been most useful and
will in future, I hope, be even more so.
People have been speaking of slums for a
very long time. With the help of section 35
of that act and the co-operation of provincial
and municipal governments, much can be
done to remove hovels. I am astonished

that all the provinces did not take advantage
of this act. Ontario did and is glad of it,
since hundreds of houses in severai places
in the province, where federal, provincial
and municipal governments co-operated
together, were built to replace hovels.
Under section 35 of the act governing the
Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation,
the federal government undertakes to pay
75% of the cost of construction of those
houses, thus leaving only 25% to be assumed
by the provincial and the municipal governments. These provisions, however, do not
solve all the problems. There are many
other houses which could be built and which
are being built outside of these communities,
or rather of these groups of houses built in
a row. So many individuals would like to
build, but lack the down payment required
to benefit under the Housing Act. Insurance
companies are willing to lend in certain
centres, but in most small centres they refuse.
Credit unions, it is true, particularly in my
own province, have invested nearly a hundred million dollars in housing, but they
cannot solve all problems. In order to obtain
housing loans, the borrower must be able
today to produce 20% of the cost of his
house. We hope under the new amendments
to reduce this margin to 10% or less and
even, if it were possible, to remove it
altogether. And this is why: there is a class
of people called the white-collar people, the
office workers, the people who work in stores,
the civil servants, who have been with the
same employer for many years. They receive
reasonable salaries, but as they have always
had to pay quite a high rent, and owing to
family costs, they have been unable to
save anything, which means that they are not
in a position to pay the 20% or 10% which
would allow them to become owners. However, they have paid in rent much more than
the cost of constructing a house. And these
people, who make up the most stable class
of society, the one on which we count the
most, are the very ones who, proportionately
to their income, are taxed the most heavily.
The white-collar man cannot hide his income,
on which he is taxed every month or week.
That is a class which we have, unfortunately,
never helped. Would it not be possible to
find some solution to his trouble, so that the
provincial, municipal or even the federal
government might advance the 20% or 10%
which he lacks, or waive this requirement
altogether? Formerly the act provided that
when the federal government made a loan

NOVEMBER 25, 1952
of 90% it guaranteed the borrower against
all losses up to 15%. Well, if the provinces,
for instance, guaranteed the other 10%, the
borrower would still have a margin of
security of 25%; thus, the lending companies
might make these loans because-and this
should be noted-these loans are being made
to a class of people whose moral guarantee
is sound. In 1944, the government of Quebec,
the government of our -distinguished colleague from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Godbout)
passed an act which was sanctioned on June 3.
This act allowed the government to guarantee
the other 10 %. I was very anxious that this act
should be applied. Why should not the governments make use of such a measure without repealing the present act, under which
the Quebec government pays 3% of the
interest rate on loans up to $6,000? The action
of the Quebec government in paying part of
the interest up to a certain amount was a
very wise step, but only those who are in a
position to lay out $1,500 or $2,000 can take
advantage of it.
Let us think of the salaried people with
heavy family charges, honest industrious
people, but who have never been able to lay
away the 20% or 10% required to build a
home. These people, however, who have
always paid quite a high rent would be able
to repay on the same basis and, after twenty
or twenty-five years would own a house. A
house costing $10,000 at 5% interest might be
repaid over twenty-five years by monthly
instalments of $58.46 and as, in the province
of Quebec, the government pays 3% on more
than half the loan, this would represent a
rent of some $40 a month. If 70% or 80%
of our people were some day to become
owners, much would have been done te contend with subversive ideas. The man who
has a property to protect, a piece of land to
defend, is in no mood to listen to communistic
theories.
We complain that our young people are
frivolous, that they have no respect for their
neighbours' property. Let us afford them the
means of looking after their own property,
their own assets, and everything will be
changed. A man naturally protects his own
little homesite. On going over statistics I
find that in some of the larger centres homeowners number hardly more than 14%; and
when agitation breaks out in these localities
I am not surprised; because more than 80%
of the people there have nothing to defend,
but everything to ask for.
68112-3

In everyone of us, there is something which
binds us to the piece of land, to the home
where we were born and bred.
When I give lectures here and there, I
like to hear the young people tell me what
they do at home. At home! It means so
much: it means the house where we live, the
home where we find happiness, joy and love.
Home is a thing we own. The word "home"
brings back to my mind the verses of the
poet:
Objets inanimés,

Avez-vous donc une âme
Qui s'attache à notre âme
Et la force d'aimer?

Let us take the means to make these
dreams come true. Long speeches and sermons are useless. Let us act and, through
co-operation in a truly constructive spirit, all
political parties of the country will agree
once for all in order to establish something
which is alive, real and advantageous.
Some would like to know how much it
would cost. They fear the government is
going to spend to no useful end millions upon
millions of dollars. The federal and provincial governments and even the municipalities
may possibly lose a few million dollars. How
much are we spending today for defence?
How much for road construction and other
things, and sometimes without any immediate results? We are preparing ourselves for
defence, in case of attack; but moral defence is an even more constructive and
real thing. To make the nation not only
strong and powerful but also happy because
there will be a deeper brotherly feeling and
more love in the heart of each one of its
citizens, to insure the peace and social welfare
of every Canadian, it is well worth risking a
few million dollars.
Great undertakings for the development of
the St. Lawrence have been forecast. Here
again, people are not of one mind. In every
field, it is the same; but in every case we
have the future in mind and the development
of the whole country.
Canada is not a mere province; it is a vast
country stretching from the Atlantic to the
Pacific. In a few years time our majestic
St. Lawrence will be opened to the very
heart of the country and bring prosperity
to all the provinces. St. Laurent, a symbolic
name for us, indeed. Our Prime Minister is
called by the same name as our great river.
Is this not symbolic, that he should be

bring prosperity to the country, so will
our Prime Minister long continue to lead the
nation wisely and to ensure, by his sound and
careful leadership, the material and moral
prosperity which we need.
(Text):
If we wish to assure the prosperity of our
country we should not only consider the
material side, but should develop the spiritual
and moral angle, which must be present in
the mind and heart of every person. On
this subject may I quote the words of Mr.
Clarence Francis, Chairman of the General
Foods corporation:
You can buy a man's time, you can buy a man's
presence at a given place, you can even buy a
measured number of muscular motions per hour or
day; but you cannot buy enthusiasm, you cannot buy initiative, you cannot buy loyalty, you
cannot buy the devotion of hearts, minds and souls.
You have to earn these things.
It is ironical that Americans, the most advanced
people mechanically, technically and industrially,
should have waited until a comparatively recent
period to inquire into the most promising single
source of productivity, namely, the human will to
work. It is hopeful, on the other hand, that the
search is now under way.

Let us apply these principles and with
co-operation and good will our country will
continue to be prosperous and to live in perfect harmony.
My last words will be the same as those
used at the end of the Speech from the
Throne:-May Divine Providence bless and
guide our deliberations.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Charles G. Hawkins: Honourable senators, it is a very great privilege for me to
second the motion which has been so eloquently moved by the honourable senator
from Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt). I
wish to thank the honourable the leader of
the government in this house (Hon. Mr.
Robertson), on behalf of the province of which
we are both so proud, and personally, for the
privilege he has accorded me.
Among the many projects referred to in the
Speech from the Throne, and contributing to
improved and expanded services to our nation,
are two which are of special significance to
Nova Scotia. They are the continuation of
the Canso causeway and the new ferry service between Yarmouth and Bar Harbour,
Maine.

The need of the Canso causeway has been
apparent for more than half a century, and
as the steel and coal development on Cape
Breton Island has grown in importance, both
to the province and to Canada, that need has
become more urgent. The value of this great
industrial unit was clearly demonstrated
during both world wars, and the problem of
ferrying across the strait the steel and coal
so necessary for Canada's war effort emphasized the need for more adequate transportation facilities between this great industrial
area and the mainland. The completion of
this rail and highway link will be a further
step in unifying and consolidating our industries and our people.
Since her earliest days Nova Scotia's geographical proximity to the New England
States bas been a most important factor in
her development. Indeed, the economies of
these two areas may be regarded as complementary; and prior to confederation their
people, who claimed a common heritage
socially, culturally and politically, enjoyed a
tremendous volume of trade which was
almost exclusively water-borne by small sailing ships. After confederation, with the introduction of trade barriers, this trade was
greatly curtailed, with the result that at the
present time this means of transportation has
almost disappeared. The pattern of distribution in the New England area also has
changed from water-borne traffic to rail and
road deliveries.
The inauguration of this
proposed ferry service should do much to
revive this trade, especially in the products
of farm, forest and sea, and should prove a
great stimulant to the business life of western
Nova Scotia. I feel that the people of my
province would wish me to express to the
government of Canada, and to all those associated with these major projects, their deep
thanks and appreciation for bringing to reality
the dreams of many generations.
During the past year this country has
enjoyed a continuing high level of prosperity.
This is due, of course, to the phenomenal
industrial expansion of the past decade. During this period our population has grown by
21 per cent, our foreign trade has tripled,
and our gross national output has increased
100 per cent. The same story is true in nearly
every other phase of our economy, and while
the number of people employed in agriculture
is less than it was before the war, agricultural
production is up 25 per cent. Forestry production has nearly doubled; aluminum has

NOVEMBER 25, 1952
increased five times; petroleum six times, and
iron ore thirty-eight times. Nearly three
times as many automobiles and six times as
many refrigerators are being produced as in
the pre-war years. Such a list could be
extended almost indefinitely.
The people of this country are keenly conscious of this tremendous production, and
while there are many contributing factors,
you will, I am sure, agree with me that the
major contribution towards our tremendous
industrial growth has been made by this
government, largely as the result of its sound
economic and financial policies.
Certainly
these advances would not have been made if
investors and those with risk capital, both
within the country and without, had not had
implicit confidence in the essential soundness
of the government's policy and administration. This confidence was most aptly voiced
by Mr. Keith Funston, President of the New
York Stock Exchange, in speaking recently
before a dinner of some 600 business, financial
and public men on the 100th Anniversary of
the Toronto Stock Exchange. IIe said, and
I quote:
I believe that the second century of your career
will prove to be a period of growth and progress
even beyond your dreams today. Canada is notably a country of massive natural resources, but
your government, business and financial leaders
have demonstrated that they have the courage,
imagination and skill to make certain that the
rewards of free enterprise are shared by all people.

If we to the south are a trifle envious it is not
because we begrudge you a material reward created
by your own efforts.
We do, however, envy the environment In which
capital Is encouraged to work in Canada, and the
respect accorded the risk taken. We could use a
little more of that encouragement at home, to put
it mildly. You have encouraged an inflow of venture capital not only from your own citizens but
from every corner of the globe. You have no punitive capital gains tax, no excess profits tax, and you
have not placed road blocks in the path of venture
capital legitimately seeking employment.

Simultaneously with her vast industrial
growth, Canada's trade position has forged
ahead, until today, notwithstanding our size,
we have become the third greatest trading
nation in the world. It must be remembered
that in order to maintain these standards of
growth, foreign trade must be regarded as
little less than our life-line. At present we
export two-thirds of our wheat, 95 per cent of
our paper and 80 per cent of our aluminum.
In fact, Canada's total exports to other countries during the last year amounted to some
four billions of dollars.
How has this been accomplished? How have
we since 1935 increased by three times the
amount of our exports? It was not through
any casual or haphazard development. It has
been achieved by the sound, multilateral trade
policies of the federal administration, by the

continued reduction and removal of trade
barriers, and through the government's untiring efforts to increase and develop our trade
with the Commonwealth, with the United
States, and with nations in every corner of
the world. If we are to maintain this position, which makes us the greatest trading
nation of the world for our size, we must be
prepared to export both finished products
and raw materials to every country which
needs them; otherwise, they will be unable to
secure the money to pay for our goods.
Opposition groups in this country contend,
of course, that this exportation of raw materials from Canada should cease forthwith, and
that we should export only finished products.
This policy of self-containment is illogical
and unsound for a variety of reasons.
Firstly-Trading is a two-way street, and
valuable markets for our products such as
wheat, copper or nickel, would be lost if
other countries were unable to earn the
dollars necessary for their purchase by selling
to us their raw materials and finished
products.
Secondly-Canadian consumers would be
forced to pay higher prices for many commodities which at the present time we can
procure more cheaply elsewhere than in
Canada.
Thirdly-If we refuse to export to other
countries any of our raw materials, they
would naturally retaliate by refusing to ship
their materials to us. This would, of course,
cripple many industries, such as those engaged in the manufacture of aluminum products, which require Bauxite from outside
Canada.
Fourthly-These are the steps which encourage war, and there is no need to remind
members of this house that it was the
inability to market their goods and the
unavailability of imports that in a large
part were responsible for the attempts by
Germany and Italy to seize by force of arms
those areas producing goods which they
required.
The government's present sound trade
policy and multilateral world'trade are necessary and complementary to our continued
economic expansion. It is wrong trade policies, those which protect and restrict which
are supported by opposition groups, that
have previously damaged our trade position,
and could even now bring incalculable harm,
and stifie or choke our present rapid growth.
Much bas been said recently about the loss
of the British market. There has, of course,
been no loss. There has, in fact, not even
been a reduction in the amount of our trade
with Britain. On the contrary, exports to
Britain have increased from 470 millions of
dollars in 1950 to 631 millions of dollars

SENATE
in 1951, and it is anticipated that they will
incrense even more in 1952. These figures
also represent a tremendous increase in our
exports to Britain as compared with those
in pre-war years. It is true, however, that
there have been certain items, such as lumber,
apples, bacon, eggs and salmon, which are
not being purchased by Britain and other
sterling area countries, a condition which is
entirely due to their dollar shortage.
While Canada is prepared to play ber part
and assist in recovery, this is a problem which
in the last analysis can only be solved by
Britain herself. The present policy of the
Liberal government is to develop active
Canadian trade with every country in the
world and to build up markets wherever they
may be found. As this trade grows, Canadian prosperity will continue to expand with
it. The tremendous achievements of the government fulfil a well-known French proverb,
which is equally well known to English persons-"Nothing succeeds like success".
It is also truc that the carefully-guided
progress of Canada during the past dozen
years is one of the economic marvels of the
age. In fact, so rapidly bas development
taken place that financial and economic
advisers were unable to anticipate the gross
national product with accuracy, with the
result thit the actual revenue derived through
tax levies produced a surplus over and above
the expenditures required for the fiscal year.
During the past few months much bas been
said about the so-called "surpluses". Coming
as I do from a province where the prudent
handling of financial resources is considered
a virtue, many of us do not view with horror
the fact that we are paying our way and
having a little left over for less fortunate
days: and the idea that we should pass on to
future generations obligations which should
be met now cannot, we feel, be considered
prudent.
A- already noted, these surpluses have been
due to an unexpected increase in national
production. The Budget is predicated on
econnmic activity being at a certain level, and
if that level rises the amount of the revenue
collected similarly increases. This means,
of course. that more peonle are earning more
money and get into hicher taxable brackets.
It also means that people are better off after
taxes are paid and increased savings are
possible.
Actually the word "surplus" should not he
used so loosely to describe this excess of
revenue over expenditure.
At certain stages during the period following the outbreak of the Korean war. defence
expenditures had not kept pace with the
amount set aside for such purposes, owing
to the need for re-tooling, the unavailability

of arms and materials to be purchased from
other countries, and the necessary period
required in going from a peace to a war-time
footing. Further, Canada has yet to discharge a large national debt incurred during
the war years, and if it is possible to reduce
this indebtedness in prosperous years, how
much easier it will be for everyone if times
become less favourable and revenues are at a
lower level. It was with this in mind that the
net national debt was reduced between 1948
and 1952 by more than a billion dollars.
The hue and cry being raised by the opposition groups today throughout the land is
that this surplus is the result of over-taxation.
Although figures have been published to
show the distribution of the tax dollar as
applied to national defence, social security,
interest, repayment of the national debt,
transfer payments and subsidies to provinces,
payments to veterans and other services, not
one voice has been raised suggesting a reduction of any of these services. In fact, taxes
on income are substantially lower today than
they were in 1945. and much lower than in
1948, notwithstanding the additional 17 per
cent for the new defence program following
the outbreak of the war in Korea and a surcharge of 3 per cent necessary to carry old age
pensions. An example cited is that of a
married man with two children and having
an income of $3,000. In 1948 his tax was
$230: in 1949, before Korea, it was reduced
to $105, in 1951 it was raised to $126

and

again in 1952 to $130. But of this last figure
$7goes to pay for the old age pensions which
he and his wife will receive in the amount
of $480 per annum for each of them upon
reaching the age of 70 years.
A review of the present era of prosperity
would not be complete without some reference
to the effect of the government's social
security and welfare programs.
One of the chief concerns of residents in
my province, when confederation was first
proposed, was the feeling that a great centralization movement would take place which
would be prejudicial to the economy of Nova
Scotia generally. There was a real belief that
industry located in the central provinces would
be harmful to the Maritime provinces and
that a lowor standard of living and lower
income would result. The years confirmed
those fears: the downward trend in the Maritimes materialized and the wealth of the central provinces increased. With the war, and
perhaps as a result of it, a realization became
apparent that if equal sacrifices could be
made in fighting and dying for Canada, equal
privileges and rights should be available for
living in it.
With this in mind, the government, under
the leadership of the late Prime Minister

NOVEMBER 25, 1952
Mackenzie King, initiated a program of unemployment insurance and family allowances,
to be followed later by old age pensions and
welfare schemes introduced by the present
government, under the leadership of the
present Prime Minister, the Right Honourable
Louis S. St. Laurent.
The motivating force in effecting these
measures is well known to the honourable
members of this chamber. Its purpose was
clearly stated by the present Prime Minister,
prior to and during the introduction of these
programs, in an expression of belief in the
principle that all Canadians should share in
Canada's prosperity. Through these we have
achieved .a more equal distribution of the
country's wealth, materially improved the
positions of low and middle income groups,
which comprise the majority of the population, and established a ffoor under the purchasing power of all communities.
The initiation of these programs has
attained a special significance in my province,
Nova Scotia, where in 1933 the gross income
from lumbering and fishing production, two
of our major industries, did not exceed
$11 million, whereas a purchasing power of
over $38 million was created in the province
during 1950-51 through the distribution of
family allowances, old age pensions, unemployment insurance, veterans allowances, and
health and welfare services. I could mention
here the effect of provincial subsidies, but
I did not include that because it is not really
relevant to the point I am making.
For almost two decades Canada's progress
has been spectacular. This has been achieved
under the guidance of two great Canadians
who, by their vision, leadership and tireless
devotion to Canada, have made it first among
the peoples of the world who value freedom,
political stability and sound administration.
National unity within our own borders, our
proud place in the British Commonwealth of
Nations and our unselfish approach to the
problems confronting less fortunate countries are the elements which have brought
us to our present position of pre-eminence
and gained for us respect and admiration in
the councils of the free nations of the world.
The continuation of this leadership and the
pursuit of the government's policies in promoting production at home and continuing
stimulation of world trade will assure to both
present and future generations a way of life
and a standard of living unsurpassed in any
part of the world.
Sorne Hon. Senators: Ilear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, as a
matter of general practice, I think the leader
of the opposition adjourns the debate at this
time. I exercise that prerogative, and move
that the debate be adjourned.

The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.
CRIMINAL CODE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill O, an Act respecting
the Criminal Law.
He said: Honourable senators, I regret
that while speaking to this bill last evening
I unintentionally mislead the house in general, and my honourable friend from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), in particular,
in suggesting that my colleague the Minister
of Justice would come to the Senate to explain this bill in detail today. Honourable
senators will recall that a similar bill to
amend the criminal law was introduced last
session and was explained in detail by the
minister.
My honourable friend from
Toronto-Trinity said that he would prefer to
hear what the minister had to say on the
details of the new bill before expressing
himself. I had not discussed with the minister the question of his coming to this house,
but had assumed from our conversations that
he would be here. When I asked him today if
he would be here, he indicated that he was
quite willing to come, but felt that he would
serve no useful purpose by doing so, because the bill now before us is substantially
the same as the one presented last session.
It should be pointed out however, that this
bill embodies certain recommendations made
by the sub-committee of this house as well
as some made by the legal profession and
other bodies. The minister felt that the
present measure should be treated as a general
revision of the criminal law. That being so,
he was making preparations to come before
the appropriate committee of this house to
explain the measure in detail and outline
all the recommendation made, some of which
are not incorporated in the measure before us.
I have felt, honourable senators, that I
owed to the house this explanation of the
procedure which the minister intends to
follow, and under the circumstances, I would
ask the house to be content with a brief explanation which I shall now attempt to give.
Honourable senators will recall that Bill
H-8, a measure to revise the Criminal Code
introduced last session, was referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, which in turn referred it to a subcommittee. Because of the adjournment of
parliament, the sub-committee was unable
to complete its work and present its final
report. It did, however, bring in an interim
report recommending certain changes and
suggesting certain clauses be stood over for
discussion in the standing committee.

SENATE
During the recess the bill has been studied
by members of the legal profession in their
associations as well as by others, and representations have been made with respect to
some of the changes proposed by the subcommittee and certain other provisions of
the bill. The government has accepted some
of the changes recommended by our subcommittee and by the associations mentioned,
and has incorporated them in the bill now
before us. In view, however, of the divergence of opinion on other proposed changes,
the government has felt that they should not
be embodied in the bill to be introduced, at
this session, but should be deferred until
there has been an opportunity to consider
them in our committee. Both the changes
recommended and accepted and those recommended but not accepted can be considered in
detail when the bill goes before the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce.
I hope that honourable senators will share
the view that I have expressed. It should be
borne in mind that even those recommendations from the sub-committee which are
acceptable to the minister and to the government, were not actually considered by the
main committee. In view of all the changes
which have been proposed, the matter can,
I am sure, be expedited by referring the bill
to the Banking and Commerce Com.mittee as
soon as possible. I will do everything I can
to facilitate progress in this regard.
Hon. A. W. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
I must express disappointment that the Minister of Justice has not come to address us at
this time, although I quite understand his
reasons for not doing so. I thought that
some purpose might be served by our listening to what the minister had to say, and by
our taking him into our confidence in the
matter of objections to the measure. The bill
now presented to us contains a number of
highly controversial sections, and I believe
that some discussion of them at this time
would have served a useful purpose.
The honourable senator from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden) and I discussed, the matter this
morning. We agree that it is highly desirable
that this bill go to the committee as soon as
possible so that the work that we were doing
at the adjournment of the last session may be
resumed.
I would not be too sure of my figures, but
I believe that some twenty-six of the suggestions made by the subcommittee and reported
to the general committee have been incorporated in the text of the bill now before us.
I have not yet had an opportunity to find out
how accurately or how satisfactorily those
changes have been made: that is still a matter
for us to look into. I have also checked and
found that, roughly, fifteen or so of our

recommendations have not been incorporated
in the text. It might serve some purpose to
go il

these ratatters, but under the

stances, particularly as the minister is not
here, it might be better to refrain from debate
at this time and to refer the matter at once
to committee, where we can undertake the
laborious job of going through the bill section
by section and of preparing a report for the
general committee and a report by the general
committee to the house. So I shall have
nothing more to say at this stage in connection with the matter.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I do not propose to delay the house, and I
trust I shall not say anything which will cause
a continuation of the debate, because I
heartily agree with the honourable government leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) and the
honourable member for Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck) that the bill should go at once
to committee.
At this time I particularly want to point
out to honourable senators who are members
of the committee, but not members of the
legal profession, that it is their right and
duty to take part in the discussion of the bill.
All of the questions involved are not essentially legal at all; many of the important
decisions in the administration of the criminal
law are made by juries. When the previous
bill was before the committee I was not as
diligent in my attendance there as were the
honourable senators from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck), Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden), and Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris). Not being a criminal lawyer-if I
am a lawyer of any description-my point of
view is more that of the non-legal man. My
conclusion, after many hours of deliberation by the committee, is this: while I fully
appreciate the work of the honourable
senators I have mentioned, as well as that of
the honourable member from Grandville (Hon.
Mr. Bouffard), and their knowledge of both
the essentials and the fine points of the
criminal law, it is the duty of the non-legal
members of the Banking and Commerce Committee to be present all the time when this bill
is under consideration. The four distinguished
lawyers I have referred to will readily and
clearly put before their associates the significance of any section which is in question.
But let me say to our non-legal members:
The opinion of these legal gentlemen as to
the contents of these sections is, in the final
analysis, worth not a bit more than yours,Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Precisely.
Hon. Mr. Haig: -because we are dealing
with the liberties of men and women. If
the bill as amended is criticized in another

NOVEMEER 25, 1952
place, that criticismn wMl fail primarily flot
upon these four iawyers, but upon the nonlegal men and women of this house, and I
would
impress that upon them very
emphatically.
One important feature of the bll-I speak
subject to correction-is that, whereas
formeriy the common law of England applied
in titis country, by this bill ail the criminal
law of Canada is to be contained in the Code.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Oniy as to offences.
After this Code has been ad-opted ail the
offences under the common iaw will be in
the Code, but the law as to defences, procedure and so on will still be the common
law of England.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But, as I understand it,
the offences will be contained in the Code.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Offences-yes.
Han. Mr. Haig: It is our duty to see to it
that ail offences are covered. Let me give
one illustration of what I mean. Some of us
who have been members of this house for
a considerable time will remember that a
few years ago the Attorney General of
Ontario, and perhaps the Attorneys General
of Nova Scotia, Quebec, and other provinces,
recommended an amendment of the Code to
provide that if two or more people went into
a store for purposes of robbery, -and one of
them had a gun and in the course of the
operation shot and kilied some person, he
should be deemed guilty of murder. I arn
flot discussing whether such a provision is
or is flot a proper one, but the fact that the
recommendation was adopted indicates the
importance to ahl citizens of the content of
our criminal law. For the most part, the
provisions of the Code relate not to rights
regarding money and other property, but to
the very liberty and life of the subi ect.
In what I have said I arn in no way reflecting on the legal profession. Lawyers, and
especially the able professionai. men on our
committee, wish to give Canadians the best
law possible; but their very legal training
may induce in them a one-sided or partial
view. The commission which drafted the
Code consisted almost without exception of
Crown prosecutors and judges-and many
trial judges are Crown prosecutors before
they go on the Bench. It foliows that the
interests of the defence were but littie repreThe onus is al
sented on the commission.
the more cleariy on this house to see that
those interests are not ignored. I have neyer
forgotten the statement which a Chief Justice
of my province made when addressing a
number of young iawyers. He said 'I
68112-4

would rather let nine guilty men be acquitted
than have one innocent man hanged." The
principle of that statement is both good law
-and good common sense. I do not like to,
see a guilty man or woman go free, but stili
iess would I want to see an innocent man or
woman convicted. It is our duty to defend
the rights of the people of this country, to
see that law and order are maintained and
police forces respected, and to support government policy to that end. We want the
criminal law to be properly administered,
and we must see to it that the law is s0
framed that this shall be done.
For these reasons, I arn wholly in favour
of giving the bill second reading and sending
it to committee; and such time as I can spare
I wihi devote to helping the committee. But
again I plead with our lay members to be
present at the committee meetings.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second tirne.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,

Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
FOOD AND DRUGS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bihl J, an Act respecting
food, drugs, cosmetics and therapeutic
devices.
H-e said: Honourable senators, as I intimated yesterday, this bill is substantially the
same as Bihl E-il which was given second
reading and referred to, a committee last
June. The changes which have been made
in the bill now before us are of a very minor
nature, invoiving onhy one or two words. I
would remind the house that Bihl E-il was
introduced at the last session mereiy for the
purpose of securing its distribution and m-aking it available to interested parties throughout the country. It was not contemplated
that the Senate wouid consider the bill in
detail at that time, but it was hoped that it
wouhd be re-introduced at the present session.
The Department of National Health and
Welfare has been advised that representations may be expected from certain groups
interested in this legisiation. As a matter of
fact, the Canadian Manufacturers Association
has already submitted. to the minister a brief
covering a number of points raised in Bihl
E-il respecting food and cosmetics. It is not
improbable that various other associations

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I would point out that
this house gave second reading to a bill last

that second reading be postponed, if that is
what my honourable friend from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) wishes. It is not
urgent that second reading be given today,
although I should like the bill to be referred
to committee some time this week.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I do not know that I

Association have been carefully considered by
representatives of the association and officials
of the department, and substantial agreement
has been reached in respect of most of them.
I am sure that honourable senators will want
to consider these points. If the house sees
fit to give the bill second reading it is my
intention to refer it to the Standing Committee on Public Health and Welfare, and I
would ask that this committee meet as soon
as possible in order to set down dates for the
hearing of witnesses.

FOOD AND DRUGS BILL
SECOND READING
The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion for the
second reading of Bill J, an Act respecting:
food, drugs, cosmeties and therapeutic:
devices.

SENATE
Hon. A. W. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
when I moved the adjourrnent of the debate
yesterday afternoon it was not because I had
any objection to this bill, or any comments
to make on it; I was totally uninformed with
regard to it. I moved the adjournment
because at that time the bill had not been
distributed, and I thought it was exceedingly
bad form for this house to proceed to pass a
bill which had not been presented to us at
our desks for study and attention-in effect
to give approval to the principle of a bill
when we had no knowledge of what it contained. In this instance-and this is the
reason why it was suggested that we should
approve it yesterday-a bill bearing the same
title was before us at the last session. But
the present bill is not that bill; alterations
have been made. So there is no doubt that
we should never pass a measure of this kind,
or any bill at all, until we have had it before
us long enough to read it and know what
is in it. Otherwise, one can easily imagine
unscrupulous persons taking advantage of
the house. Of course, when I raised the
objection there was no opposition to the
adjournment of the second reading until
today.
In the meantime I have read the bill. One
can scarcely read any measure which is laid
before parliament without as a consequence
having some thoughts to express about it;
and my first observation with regard to this
bill is that it is a restrictive measure, and
as such should have the most meticulous
attention in a house of this kind.
Not only is this a restrictive measure, but
the restrictions have been intensified since
the passage of the original Act some years
ago; and every restriction of this type should
be carefully scrutinized by this house. In
matters of this kind one recalls these words
of a famous philosopher: "Eternal vigilance
is the price of liberty".
This bill refers to the health of Canada's
citizens, and whenever measures come before
us affecting the freedom of the individual in
matters of health I take the stand that I am
"from Missouri". There are always people
interested financially in the health of the
individual, and different schools of healthtreatment are always competing with one
another. In addition there are jealousies
within the schools themselves, and somebody
is always finding some method of making
money out of legislation which on its face
appears to be only in the interest of the dear
sweet public. I remember an incident involving Mark Twain when a committee of the
United States Senate was inquiring into a
similar restrictive health measure many years
ago. Appearing before the committee, Mark
Twain commented "Who shall interfere

between my grandmother and myself as to
her inalienab.le right to rub camphor on my
leg?" Camphor in those days was the great
specific. Well, who shall interfere today in
these personal matters of health?
Let me deal with the bill in more detail.
The word "advertisement" is defined in section 2 of the bill as follows:
(a) "Advertisement" includes any representation
by any means whatever for the purpose of
promoting directly or indirectly the sale or disposal
of any food, drug, cosmetic or device;

Now, I would stress the words "by any
means whatever", for most representations
are made orally by word of mouth. Surely
freedom of speech with regard to drugs and
health and so on is not to be prohibited by
this measure.
Then in the very opening sentence of the
bill we find a rather sloppy piece of draftsmanship. I would point out the small detail
that it uses the words "by any means whatever", whereas on the very next page we find
in exactly the same context the words "for
any purpose whatsoever".
It is a small
matter, but the use in the same context of
two words having largely the same meaning
but a different form indicates careless
draftsmanship.
Section 3(1) of the bill reads:
No person shall advertise-

-and do not forget that in this bill the word
"advertise" includes advertising by word of
mouth-any food, drug, cosmetic or device to the general
public as a treatment, preventative or cure for any
of the diseases, disorders or abnormal physical
states mentioned in Sciedule "A".

Before I deal with Schedule "A" let me
point out that "drug" includes a great many
items. For instance, it includes any substance
or mixture of substances that may be used
for the purpose of restoring, correcting or
modifying organic functions in man or animal.
That is pretty wide. Within the bill the
meaning of "drug" also includes any substance or mixture of substances that may be
used for disinfection in premises in which
food is manufactured, prepared or kept, or
for the control of vermin. The definition of
"drug" is a long one, and for my present
purposes it is not necessary to read it. But
I would point out how wide this definition is.
The bill proposes to prevent the advertising
of any drug for the treatment of the items
mentioned in Schedule "A". I shall not
attempt to read the whole schedule, but I
notice it includes heart disease. As I have
already said, I consider myself as "from
Missouri" in matters affecting health, so I
rather suspect that heart disease and its
treatment will not entirely overlook the use

NOVEMBER 26, 1952
of vitamin E, and the controversy that has
been going on in the medical profession with
regard to it. Schedule "A" also lists obesity.
Apparently, if this measure is passed, nobodv
will be permitted to tell anyone else about
any material which may be used for the
control of obesity. Well, do you not think
that is going a bit far?
Let me call the attention of the members
to the new powers which it is proposed to
give the inspectors. The explanatory note
to Section 21 reads in part as follows:
It extends the present authority of an inspector
to permit him to enter any place where he has
reason to believe there is any article intended for
sale or things relating thereto to which the bill or
the regulations apply ...

Now then, we find that the definition of
This means
"sales" includes distribution.
that if an inspector merely believes that there
may be something in your house for "distribution"-which in the ordinary sense may mean
something entirely different from "sale"he may walk into your premises without a search warrant and examine, seize,
and detain such article. Is this right? I
appreciate that legislation such as this, and
the department's regulations controlling the
handling, quality and purity of foodstuffs, are
for the protection and good of the public.
I realize that the distribution among our
people of drugs-I am using the word in
its ordinary English meaning-is a very
serious matter indeed. It has been reserved
to those who are professionals in the work,
and properly so. But this is a matter with
which this house is undoubtedly concerned,
and one to which the very best of good
judgment should be applied by us. When I
say "us" I mean that, for the bill originates
with us, and we shall be taking responsibility
for it if we send it down to the other place.
I wish to emphasize that a bill of this kind
requires the very best of good judgment to
hold the balance evenly between the real
interests of our people and the interests of
private individuals who possibly would make
money out of restricting the public rights.
I do hope, therefore, that the committee to
whom this bill will be referred wfi study
it with the greatest of care and with a "from
Missouri" attitude al the way through. I
think the committee should call the responsible departmental officials before it and
require from them a thorough explanation
of the bill. They should be asked whether
they really need all the powers given to
them by the bill, and whether they could not
possibly get along with some a little less
drastic. Is it not possible to devise some
safeguards which would prevent an inspector
from being, perhaps, a bit "high hat"? In

other words, can the bill not be changed so
as .to avoid overlooking utterly that great
general principle of English law that a man's
house is his castle?( I commend the bill to
the committee for very close study, and hope
that it will be scrutinized with extreme care.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE POSTPONED

On the Order for resuming consideration of
His Excellency the Governor General's
speech, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt for an Address in Reply thereto:
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I

LOAN COMPANIES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Norman P. Lambert (for Hon. Mr.
Robertson) moved the second reading of
Bill C, an Act to amend the Loan Companies
Act.
He said: Honourable senators, in connection
with this bill and the one immediately following it on the Order Paper, an Act to amend
the Trust Companies Act, I should like to
point out that in 1947 there was introduced
here, and passed by this house and the other
house, a bill to amend the Canadian and
British Insurance Companies Act and the
Foreign Insurance Companies Act, enabling
insurance companies who come under federal
jurisdiction to invest in the securities of the
International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development. The purpose of the bill now
before us is simply to amend the Loan Com-

SENATE
panies Act so as to extend a similar privilege
to all loan companies to whom this Act
applies.
There is nothing particularly new in the
bill except the provision extending this
privilege to the loan companies, and that is
in clause (v) of the first section, which reads:
Paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of section 61 of
the Loan Companies Act, chapter 28 of the Revised
Statutes of Canada, 1927, is repealed and the
following substituted therefor:
"(a) the debentures, bonds, stocks or other securities (v) of or guaranteed by the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development established by the Agreement for an International Bank
for Reconstruction and Development approved by
the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, 1945".

If the bill is sent to committee, any detailed
information that may be required as to the
present status of the International Bank can
be furnished there. I have a good deal of
information along that line right here, and if

it is thought desirable I can give it now. There
is not much new in this detailed information.
Particulars as to the bank's set-up and its
relations with borrowing countries were placed
on our Hansard in 1947. However, it might
be interesting to point out that the bank's
general standing throughout the world has
risen very substantially in recent years. The
purpose in founding the bank was to provide
a source of funds for reconstruction to
European countries which had been affected
adversely during the war. In its first years
of operations the bank lent some half-billion
dollars to various countries of western Europe,
but it was soon found that demands for funds
to finance reconstruction in those ýcountries
were so heavy that the objectives of the
International Bank as set forth in the Bretton
Woods Agreement could not be met. Honourable members will recall that the Marshall
Plan was approved in 1947 and commenced to
operate in 1948. It has continued until the
present time. The International Bank has
devoted its efforts to the other parts of the
world, and has already distributed a billion
and a half by way of loans to some twentyseven countries.
I may say that in February of this year
an issue of $15 million four per cent bonds
floated by the International Bank was
quickly over-subscribed in Canada. Canada,
as a member of the International Bank and
the International Monetary Fund, desires
through her borrowing and lending institutions to take advantage of the opportunity
to invest in what appears to be a secure
financial organization. This bill is sponsored by the Federal Minister of Finance,
and I think we need have no hesitation in
approving it on second reading.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I should like to ask the
honourable gentleman whether the Dominion
of Canada guarantees the bonds Lu which he
referred?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The Dominion of Canada is already a member of the International
Bank and has subscribed $65 million as ber
share of its capital. In other words, there
is a joint guarantee. The capital of the
bank is very considerable, and only twenty
per cent has been utilized. Twenty per cent
of our total contribution is $65 million. The
operations of the bank have been sufficiently
remunerative to make further payment
unnecessary. The fact is that we are already
a guarantor of the whole operations of the
bank, and, any company which chooses to
invest in its bonds would automatically have
the guarantee of the Dominion of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I was wondering what
security loan companies would have, and
how they could enforce payment of these
bonds, for instance.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: As I have said, the
bond issue of $15 million recently floated in
Canada was quickly taken up by all kinds
of institutions. The loan companies and the
trust companies were not authorized to invest
in the bonds, but the insurance companies,
for instance, bought them up with, I suppose,
the same confidence as they would have in
buying bonds of the government of Canada,
the government of Great Britain or any other
government. These bonds are backed by
some fifty-five nations, each of which has
contributed its share of the capital required
in the setting up of the International Bank.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I assume that the responsibility for the redemption of these bonds must
ultimately rest with the International Bank,
and that our country would have no responsibility beyond its original contribution of $65
million. In other words, we have no responsibility to any individual trust company. That
responsibility,

I would

say, rests

entirely

upon the International Bank. Am I right in
that regard?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: That is correct. The
bank was incorporated after the passage of
joint legislation by all the member countries,
in much the same way as the United Nations
was set up, and contributions for that purpose
were provided for. Canada, for instance, contributes to the United Nations 3-4 per cent
of the total cost. In the case of the International Bank the member countries could, if
necessary, be called upon to supply the balance of the capital subscribed; however, as I
have said, future prospects are so favourable

NOVEMBER 26, 1952
that the twenty per cent already contributed
would seem to be sufficient to meet its needs.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
with only the amendment and not the Act
before me, I find it a little difficult to visualize the exact limit of authority that is being
applied to this bill. The explanatory notes
indicate that the amendment is aimed at insurance companies and trust companies who
invest in bonds issued by the International
Bank. I would point out that many trust
companies and insurance companies are incorporated by provincial charter, and that the
investment of money is a matter of civil
rights. How then does the sponsor of the bill
justify this measure, which deals with what
is really a matter of provincial jurisdiction
affecting the investment of moneys?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: In saying that trust
companies and loan companies are not conpletely under the jurisdiction of the federal
authorities my honourable friend has raised
a point which is certainly new to me.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Ail of them are not.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: True, there may be
some local loan companies which are not,
but I am quite sure that all those to which
this amendment is intended to apply are
authorized by federal charter.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That may be so.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Certainly they come
within the jurisdiction of the department that
would supervise this operation.
Hon. Mr. McLean: Honourable senators, I
should like to ask the sponsor of the bill
what is the commitment of the Dominion of
Canada to the capital of this bank?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Canada's total subscription to the capital is approximately $360
million, of which twenty per cent, or $65
million, has already been paid. The bill
authorizing such a contribution was passed
by parliament two or three years ago.
Hon. Mr. McLean: Honourable senators, I
remember when the Bretton Woods agreement was made and the International Bank
was organized for the purpose, as I understood, of helping down-trodden nations. I
pointed out at that time that this bank was
neither a bank of issue nor a bank of deposit,
and that any money it lent had first to be
borrowed from the member nations at, as has
been said, about four per cent. That means
that with the overhead costs, commissions and
other expenses, the down-trodden nations will
have to pay about five or six per cent for any
money they get. That does not seem reasonable to me.

Hon. Mr. Lambert: I should have pointed
out when introducing the bill that of the 15
million which was recently raised in Canada,
a good deal is being spent here, and considerable reconstruction work is being done.
Hon. Mr. McLean: Canada has never
received any loans from the bank.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Canada is benefiting
very greatly by the reconstruction work that
is being done, not only under the auspices of
this institution but of the Marshall plan as
well. By investing our money in this kind of
issue we are doing a good deal towards financing our own projects-a proceeding which
has become, I suppose, an outstanding feature
of our economy since the war ended.
The statement that this institution was
established for the purpose of effecting reconstruction and aid to the down-trodden countries of Europe is correct, and about $500
million was loaned for that purpose before
the Marshall plan came into effect. The
Marshall plan dealt with the problem on a
much larger scale than was contemplated by
the founders of the International Bank or
through the provisions of the Bretton Woods
agreement. I do not see anything unusual
about the bank floating its bonds and asking
member countries to invest in them. Subscribers receive a good rate of interest,
between 3j and 4 per cent. In Canada the
bonds were floated on a 4 per cent basis.
In the United States much larger issues have
been sold on a 3j per cent basis. So in respect
of these bonds we have the advantage of an
additional one-half per cent.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask one other question? Before I do so I would express the
opinion that this is a perfectly good security
for trust companies; and if there be any such
companies incorporated under provincial law
-I am not sure that there are-this federal
legislation would not effect any control over
them. After all, this legislation is merely
permissive. The responsibility of investing
in any securities issued by the International
Bank rests upon the directors of the individual trust companies, in the light of their
duty to their shareholders.
My question is this. The sponsor of the bill
has stated that Canada is committeed to the
International Bank in the amount of something like $300 million, of which some sixty
or sixty-five million dollars have actually
been contributed.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Has the levy of 20 per cent
been made generally on the countries which
are participants in the International Bank?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Quite.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Euler: And have all of them paid
up?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: All of them have paid
up, yes.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
am not going to oppose the bill, though to be
quite candid, I do not like it. I have no
difficulty about the legal question. The bill
applies only to trust companies incorporated
by the Parliament of Canada. But what I
do not like about it is that this International
Bank was and always will be a political
instrument. It is controlled largely by the
United States, who are the biggest subscribers
to it and who run it. I believe that any money
which we provide for the bank should be
contributed directly by the people through
the Parliament of Canada, because it would
then be recognized for what it is, a political
instrument, used-and I employ the term in
the best sense-for political purposes. I do
not approve of the contribution of money by
trust companies, loan companies or any other
private organizations to an institution which
is fundamentally political.
Further, I believe, although I may be
wrong, that all the money we have available
is needed for development here at home,
and that we should use it for this purpose,
because, if things go as we hope they will,
no country in the world will need more
capital than Canada. At the present time we
are offering high rates of interest and great
prospects of profit to the citizens of another
country to invest their funds here, and money
is coming in so fast that our currency has
gone above par. This condition has nothing
to do with internal management; it is entirely
the result of a flood of American money.
I have said that the International Bank
is a political instrument, and that private
companies or private citizens should not be
encouraged to invest money in such an institution. If things go wrong the Senate of
Canada will be blamed for having permitted,
by this bill, the investment of money in this
way. As a senator, I am quite willing to
vote whatever funds are necessary for the
International Bank, provided they are contributed by Canada herself. In so doing I
am deciding on the basis of my political and
business judgment that such action is in the
interests of Canada as a whole. But I do
not think I have any right to put the stamp
of approval on private investment in an
institution over which Canada has absolutely
no jurisdiction. One reads reports from all
over the world of requests for loans of money
for development. Iraq, Iran, Ceylon, Pakistan, 'India, and other nations are looking for
loans. I do not criticize them, and it may be
proper to make advances of this kind, but I

do not believe that the individual citizen is
qualified or should be expected to take the
risks they involve.
I do not oppose the reference of the bill
to committee. Like the honourable member
from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) I have a
very high regard for the directors of our
I
insurance, trust and loan companies.
believe they are as able men as any in our
Dominion. But aside from that, we here
have a responsibility which they have not.
If we pass the bill we shall be saying to
people who have money to invest in bonds
and stocks, "We have approved of this kind
of loan"; and I do not approve of it.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Honourable senators, I
do not think the points raised by the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) are well
taken. In my opinion the International Bank
is anything but a political institution. You
might call United Nations a political institution, dominated by the United States.
Hon. Mr. Haig: So it is. It is a political
institution.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Do you think it is
dominated by the United States?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I did not say that. I said
the bank was.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I do not think it is
dominated by the United States.
The Bretton Woods agreement, which was
reached after a long series of conferences,
established two institutions: the International
Bank and the Monetary Fund. Naturally the
larger nations, contributing according to their
national income, would contribute greater
sums than the smaller nations. But the
international character of these institutions,
and the spirit in which they were founded,
certainly removes them from any charge that
they are political institutions. I do not feel
that such a contention can be upheld for a
minute in any serious discussion of the subject. The honourable leader opposite, or
anyone else, is quite capable of securing in
committee the details regarding these securities as they relate to the trust companies and
loan companies. I think the principle of this
bill was adopted five years ago when we
passed legislation enabling insurance companies to invest in these securities. All that
we are asking here is that the loan companies
and the trust companies may enjoy the same
I
privilege as the insurance companies.
would point out that the trust companies and
loan companies themselves have requested
this. I think we can be sure of this because
I cannot conceive of the Department of
Finance, supported by the government of this
country, thrusting down the throats of these

NOVEMBER 26, 1952
companies the securities of the International
Bank. If there is any doubt about this, let
us get it cleared up by the officials when the
bill is in committee.
For the reasons I have given, I would urge
that the bill be given second reading.

CANADA EVIDENCE BIILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. W. de B. Farris moved the second

reading of Bill F, an Act to amend the Canada
Evidence Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
simple bill which provides for an amendment
to an amendment which was made to the
Canada Evidence Act ten years ago. The
amendment passed at that time provided that
photographic films of documents could be
used in evidence. This provision enabled
departments of the government to destroy
voluminous documents or to return documents to their rightful owners; at the same
time, the taking of photographic films, which
can be stored in a small space, was a safeguard against possible loss.
Under the amendment of ten years ago
the films were required to be taken under
specific conditions and in a prescribed manner. If the requirements were met, the
films could then be produced in court as
evidence in the same way as the original
documents could have been. One of the
requirements was that an affidavit be taken

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third

Hon. Mr. Haig: It is not necessary.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: If the house has no
objection, we are quite agreeable to having
the bill read the third time now.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I think it ought to go

do not know why the officials should not
explain how it is that these affidavits were
taken before a commissioner instead of before
a notary public. The Act makes it perfectly
clear that such affidavits must be taken before
a notary public. I do not suggest that because
of the error we should get on our high horse
and refuse to pass the validating amendment;
but as I have said, I do not know why the
officials should not come and tell us how it
comes to be necessary. It looks like a very
sloppy proceeding, and I should like to see
the bill referred to a committee.

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Norman P. Lambert moved the second
reading of Bill P, an Act respecting Interprovincial Pipe Line Company.
He said: Honourable senators, the Interprovincial Pipe Line Company, which was the
first incorporation put through parliament
under the new Pipe Lines Act of three years
ago, is really the transmission line of the
Imperial Oil Company from Alberta to Regina
and points east via southern Manitoba and
Duluth, Minnesota. The capitalization of the
company provided for $17 million in convertible debentures, and some four million
shares of common stock having a par value
of $50 each. Today this stock is worth $180
to $190 a share.
The company wishes to have the Act
amended so that its four million shares may
be redistributed on the basis of ten for one.
That would mean that instead of four million
shares of common stock, with a par value of
$50 each, as at present, there would be forty
million shares, with a par value of $5 each.
The reason for desiring this amendment is
stated pretty clearly in the explanatory notes
attached to the bill. The company wishes
to make its shares more readily available to
the public, and thinks that this will be one
result of a reduction in par value from $50
to $5. Also, the company would like to
enable employees to become shareholders.
As everybody knows, the Imperial Oil Company has a stock-sharing system for the
employees in its filling stations, the drivers
of the company's trucks, and so on, the idea
being to give them a proprietorial interest
in the company. The Interprovincial Pipe
Line Company has introduced a similar
arrangement into its economy, and it is felt
that employees would be more likely to purchase the stock if the par value were reduced
from $50 to $5 a share.
I think that the desires of the company are
justified. Its officials are only too willing to
come before a committee to explain anything
that any senators would like to have explained
in connection with this plan to subdivide their

remain exactly the same as when the company was incorporated. I would suggest that

we give the bill second reading and refer
it to the Committee on Transport and Communications, where any senators who wish
to make detailed inquiry may do so.
Hon. Mr. King: Did I understand the honourable senator to say that the original shares
of the company are today worth $180 each?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The company's stock,
with a par value of $50, two shares of which
may be obtained in exchange for every $100
convertible bond, are today worth from $180
to $190 a share.
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: It is selling for that?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: It is quoted at that. I
saw a quotation in the papers yesterday.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Why didn't you let us in
on that?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Is that valuation justified by the company's assets or earning
power, or is it just the result of market
speculation? We should not by legislation add
to the value of stock.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I am sorry that I have
not before me the last annual statement of
the Interprovincial Pipe Line Company, but
I have here the company's prospectus in
which the prospective earnings are set out. I
had the pleasure of being present at the
official opening of the pipeline, at Edmonton,
two years ago last October, so I know that
the company has been operating for two years.
One year's financial statement has been submitted to the public, and it has entirely
measured up to the claims set out in the
prospectus. I am not able to say exactly what
profits were made by the pipeline company
during the first year, because I have not the
first annual statement before me. However,
I am sure that information could be made
available to the committee.
The operations of the Interprovincial Pipe
Line Company are well known. Since the
Leduc field was opened up, the output of oil
from Alberta to meet our country's needs
has advanced from nine per cent to thirtyseven per cent. In my opinion the activities
of this company contributed largely to such
an increase. The next big outlet for Alberta
oil is through the Trans-Mountain Pipe Line
to Vancouver and other coastal points. Honourable senators will recall that following the
establishment of the Interprovincial Pipe
Line, many gas pipeline companies were
incorporated. Now the trend is toward
carrying oil westward to Vancouver and
other points on the west coast.
I do not think it can be said that the
provisions of this bill are an attempt to
influence the market or promote the stock

DECEMBER 1, 1952
of this company for the purpose of enriching
the shareholders. It must be remembered
that out of the issue of convertible debentures amounting to $17,000,000 only $7,500,000 was distributed to the public. The
balance of that issue is held by the Imperial
Oil Company and its affiliated companies in
the United States.
Hon. Mr. King: I presume that when the
company officials are before the committee
they will be able to give us further information as to the extensions into the United
States.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Did I understand my honourable friend to say that the bonds of this
company are now worth $180?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: No; the bonds would
be worth twice that amount, the reason being
that until 1954 the debentures can be converted at the ratio of two shares for one.
The bonds, therefore, would be worth not
$180 or $190 but approximately $360.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: Does the company
pay dividends on its shares now?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I do not think so.
Hon. Mr. Wood: Yes, dividends are paid.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I do not think there
bas been any public announcement as to the
payment of dividends.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I should like to learn from
my friend how widely this stock is held.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I could not say what
is the number of shareholders, apart from
the Imperial 011 Company and its associates,
but I believe that the $7,500,000 worth of
debentures made available for distribution
were bought by the public. Information as
to the number of shareholders could no
doubt be secured from the officials of the
company.
Hon. Mr. Haig: If I understand the honourable gentleman correctly, the reduction of
the par value of this stock will make it more
attractive to purchasers. Many people are
prepared to pay $5 a share for stock who
would not pay $100 a share for it, even
though it might be worth twenty-five times
as much. As my honourable friend from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) says, we
should not by legislation add to the value of
stock, if the value is not in it.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Or give the prestige of
the Senate to such a transaction.
Hon. Mr. Haig: If, on the other hand, I
know that the value is in the stock, and I am
satisfied that what I am doing is proper, that

is a different matter. If the officials of the
company will come forward and say that the
stock is worth not $50 a share but $180 a
share, I would go along on that basis and
decide what should be done about it. But
without the proper assurance I am a little
afraid that we might be giving the stockholders who are on the inside an advantage
in the development of our own natural

amount of money invested.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: They would be able to
unload their holdings.
Hon. Mr. Haig: They certainly would.
I repeat that the stock is more attractive
at $5 than it is at $100 a share.
Hon. Mr. Farris: The change would only
make it possible for those who want to buy
ta do so.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No; any person can buy the
shares he wants. I recall that on several
occasions since I have been a member of
this house the par value of stock has.been
reduced so as to give it a wider distribution.
Hon. Mr. Farris: That is to give the other
fellow a chance.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No; it just gives those who
got in early and bought at par an advantage
that they otherwise would not have. Lawyers
who do a financial business will agree with
what I say. Whenever the par value of
stock is reduced, the assets can be reduced
accordingly, and the stock will sell faster.
It is for that reason that mining stocks, for
instance, are put on the market at as low as
twenty-five cents a share. More people will
buy a stock that is selling at twenty-five cents
a share than will buy one at a dollar, even
though the latter is worth eight times as
much. In this instance I want to know what
I am doing. I think my honourable friend
would rather deal with this in committee.
If so, I will be perfectly satisfied.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Honourable senators, it
is my opinion that the value of these shares
on the market will be, not $5 each, but $18
or $19, because they are now selling at $185
to $190, and if they are split ten to one the
holders will not sell them anywhere around
$5, but at about $18.
I do not think this measure will add anything to the value of the shares; the only
result will be to widen their distribution a
little. After all, the market for these shares
will set the price. As I understand, it is not
intended to issue any new shares at $5 each.
All that is to be done is to split shares now
owned by people who have paid, perhaps,
$185 apiece for then or, perhaps, by buying
them at the commencement of the company,

SENATE
In any event, the value is
e hv ten for one;
in the other, by more than three times the
issued price.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I should like to cover
one point made by the honourable leader of
the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), namely, that
the subdivision of these shares will make
them more valuable. He must realize-for
the market bas been full of such examplesthat to subdivide a stock to make ten shares
where there was one before, bas, if anything,
a depressing influence on its value rather
than an enhancing one.
It does not seem to me fair, or even possible,
to compare the organization which is represented in connection with this by the Interprovincial Pipe Line Company with the
ordinary run of exploration companies. I hold
no particular brief from the Imperial Oil
Company, but we all know the work that was
done in the Province of Alberta before anything in the way of a producing well was
obtained. At the time this pipeline company
was incorporated, some three years ago, it
was stated that the Imperial Oil Company had
spent over $80 million in explorations in
Alberta before it had anything to show for
the outlay. I believe the principle which
has been stated here, of having the par value
of the shares reduced to $5 so that the public
can buy them more readily than they could
at the higher price, and to enable the company's own employees to share more generally
in its profits, is a sound and good one. What
is the alternative? It is, to let the State take
organize
charge of these explorations,
companies, produce the oil and sell it. What
is evident in the development of oil in this
country, particularly in the Province of
Alberta, is a fine measure of co-operation
oetween the best sort of skilled enterprise
and the state in relation to our natural
resources. The more that idea can be
encouraged and extended, the better, I suggest, for all concerned.
As to the value behind the present capital
of the company, I am willing, if honourable
senators so wish, to have the matter examined
in committee. But I myself have no hesitation in suggesting that the proposition which
is presented through this bill is a sound one.

COASTAL FISHERIES PROTECTION BILL

the nne

The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Honourable senators, I
move that this bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications.
The motion was agreed to.

Hon. A. B. Baird moved the second reading
of Bill E, an Act to protect the coastal
fisheries.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
to revise the Customs and Fisheries Protection Act, Revised Statutes of Canada,
1947, chapter 43. The main provisions of the
Act were first enacted in 1868 in a measure
entitled "The Foreign Fishing Vessels Act".
The last amendment of the Act took place
in 1913.
The principal purpose of the Act was to
protect Canadian fisheries in territorial and
inland waters from encroachment by foreign
fishing vessels, and to regulate the conduct
of foreign fishing vessels in our ports and
territorial waters. But the last half century
has brought about a significant change in the
status of Canada within the Commonwealth,
and this and the entry of Newfoundland into
Confederation, and particularly the changed
methods of fishing, involving the use of longrange fishing and processing boats, have rendered many of the provisions of the Act obsolete or at least not in harmony with the
changed conditions.
The following is a brief summary of the
defects in the existing Act which the bill
aims to remedy.
The existing Act purports to exclude from
our territorial waters foreign fishing vessels.
There is, however, no definition in the Act
of what constitutes a fishing vessel. It is
doubtful if in its ordinary sense the term
''fishing vessel" could be construed to include
vessels hunting seals or taking marine plants
in our territorial waters.
There is also serious doubt whether the
present Act would exclude vessels that are
not engaged directly in fishing, such as, for
example, fish-processing vessels, or even
mother ships which do not engage in direct
fishing but store or transport fish caught by
catching boats.
The Act only excludes fishing vessels which
are "foreign or not navigated according to
the laws of Great Britain or of Canada" and
which are not permitted to come in by "any
treaty or convention or any law of Great
Britain or of Canada."
The bill would bring the Act into line
with the present status of Canada within the
Commonwealth, and all fishing vessels except Canadian fishing vessels would be prohibited from coming into our territorial or
inland waters, unless permitted by any treaty
or law of Canada. Under the existing Act the
Governor in Council is authorized to allow

than fish, and partly because her own fishermen have been catching more cod all the time
and her need to buy from us has been thereby
reduced.
When the terms of union were being negotiated between Canada and Newfoundland,
the use of Newfoundland ports by these
foreign ships was one of the issues. It was
not a controversial issue, because Canada
readily conceded that special provision for
the use of Newfoundland ports by those
foreign ships should continue to be made.
They had not been using any of the Atlantic
ports of Canada. Provision was made to
maintain the traditional policy of the island's
foreign trading relations with those particular
countries. Since then everything has gone
along smoothly, the government of Canada
having granted yearly licences to meet the
requirements.
As I say, the purchases by Portugal and
Spain of our sait cod have fallen off very
considerably. Our need to sell this product
in those countries is no less than it ever
was, but I am not now suggesting the policy
whereby that trade may be increased. What
I am suggesting is that our power to negotiate
with these countries be retained. Let us
get what we can for what we give. Of
course, I do not wish to imply that we are
losing that power under this bill, but a little
later on I shall make a point which bears on
that.
What I wish to make clear at the moment
is that the problem to which I have been
referring is one that particularly concerns
Newfoundland. It has been tied in with
Newfoundland's economy for centuries. There
must not be any thought that what is needed
is an across-the-board adjustment applying to
the other provinces as well, for the fact is
that they are not now and have never been
vitally interested in this matter and any new
interest created would be at the expense of
Newfoundland.
Our ports in Newfoundland are used by
vessels from these foreign countries today
more than ever before. During the past
summer and fall it was not unusual to see
in the harbour of St. John's ten, fifteen or
twenty ships from these countries tied up
while taking on supplies and bait, loading
salt, etc., for the voyage to the Grand Banks.
The increase in the number of these vessels
using those fishing grounds suggests that
some time the area may be called the Banks
of the Iberian Peninsula rather than the
Grand Banks of Newfoundland.
The visits of these foreign ships to our
ports are of considerable trading value. Yet
I will tell you that the value of the business

done through sales to those vessels is insignificant in comparison with the bigger issue
of maintenance of trading relations for the
disposal of our fish. I am sure that there
is not a merchant in Newfoundland who
would say that the trade resulting from the
use of our ports by these foreign vessels has
any importance in comparison with the
importance of a clearly defined and beneficial
policy for our fish export trade with the
countries I have mentioned.
I wish to make this point very clear. It is
stated that the purpose of the bill is to revise
the existing Customs andt Fisheries Protection
Act. But as I said, the bill is not entirely
revisory. One new factor it introduces is the
inclusion of the Atlantic coast ports, that is of
the Maritime Provinces, under the same
arrangement as Newfoundland ports, for the
servicing of these foreign vessels. Now, I do
not think that the Maritime Provinces ports
would naturally be used very extensively,
since they are farther away from the Grand
Banks than our Newfoundland ports are. I
think it is quite possible that at some time,
according to the present trend, the province
of Newfoundland may have to ask the government of Canada to revise the policy for the
use of Newfoundland ports by these foreign
boats. The prevailing system has been developed and maintained because the countries
from which these vessels come have been and
are still to some extent our customers. But
these boats have not used the Maritime Provinces ports in the past, and it seems to me
quite likely that if the law is changed and
these boats use not only the ports of Newfoundland but those of Nova Scotia and even
of New Brunswick, then at some future time
if the Act comes up for revision or if it is
thought advisable in the interest of the fisheries of Newfoundland to introduce restrictions,
there might be a conflict between the provinces over policy. The Maritime Provinces
would be interested only because of desiring
to develop, one might say, shopkeeper trading
with those foreign vessels, whereas Newfoundland would regard that trade as insignificant when compared with the fish export
relations with those countries.
I presume that this bill will be referred to
a committee. I should like to see it studied
very carefully there in its full significance.
Also I think that the government of the
province of Newfoundland should be consulted and asked for its opinion as to the
future policy to be employed under such a
law as this. It has been and is a most
important issue to Newfoundland, and I hope
it will be viewed in that light by the
committee.

vessels in the south which carry nets 4,850
feet long and some 320 feet deep. It is
natural with the decline of the tuna fish elsewhere that these boats should search for more
productive areas. Many of those vessels contain freezing units, by which the fish that are
caught can be preserved indefinitely.
It can be seen that, under the treaty, the
commission on wbich I sit has some responsibility in saying to Canadian fishermen that
they may not fish for salmon during certain
months or during certain week-ends of the
year. The fishermen may reply that they
are not fishing for salmon, but everyone knows
that nets do not catch only one species of
fish.
I would suggest to the government that
when introducing a measure such as the one
now before us, consideration should be given
to the points I have mentioned, so that in
future inestimable harm may not be done to
our sockeye salmon industry. I shall have
something further to say about the Japanese
peace treaty when it comes before us for
ratification. At the moment, at least, we
are protected from Japanese fishing operations in relation to salmon, herring and
halibut.
In my opinion, honourable senators, this
is an excellent bill. It is well to bear in
mind, however, that in so far as fishery
research is concerned Canada is away behind
the times. I hang my head in shame when
I realize that Japanese fishing interests know
all the routes followed by the fish on our
Pacific coast, and where they go, but we
know little or nothing. Japanese scientists
can tell that there are in the open seas
definite lines or roads along which these fish
travel. In years before the war, when I was
pointing out these facts to the government,
very little attention was paid to Japanese
activities. I do not know whether we can
expect anything better now, but let me say
that we have a Fisheries Research Board
which needs in the worst way to be overhauled. If I were speaking outside this house
I might use stronger language. Much of the
money allotted to this work is being wasted,
and it is a fact that a foreign nation knows
more about our fisheries and fishing routes
than we Canadians know ourselves. I wonder
whether honourable senators know that,
although by treaty the Japanese have agreed
not to fish for salmon, herring or halibut,
before the war they were able to introduce
into the waters of the Pacific nets six miles
long. Do not suppose this is a "fish story";
I am giving facts. These people could, if
they desired, plant the nets right across
these lanes: they know where they are,

because their scientists located them when
Japanese boats were off our shores before
World War Il. I pointed these things out
to the government.
As I have said, this measure is splendid
as far as it goes, and I commend the government for it. My chief reason for rising
tonight is to point out that something further
should be done. Too long have fisheries
been looked upon by the government as an
orphan, instead of one of the mainstays and
basic industries of the country.
Hon. Mr. Baird: In reply to the question
of the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), I think I can
assure him, although I am less learned in
the law than he, that embedded in the existing Act are provisions dealing with this
matter of boarding and search that he has
mentioned.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Before the honourable
gentleman takes his seat, will he tell us what
have been the reactions of the appropriate
departments of the provincial governments
to the provisions of this bill?

BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. H. R. Emmerson moved the second
reading of Bill G, an Act to amend the Prisons
and Reformatories Act.
He said: Honourable senators, some years
ago British Columbia established an institution for the rehabilitation of young offenders
or delinquents sentenced to terms of not
less than three months and up to two years
less a day. In 1950, at the request of the
British Columbia government, an amendment
of the Prisons and Reformatories Act was
made, whereby the inmates could be transferred from Oakalla Prison Farm to New
Haven. This New Haven institution has been
so successful that the provincial government
has established a second institution, which
they term the Young Offenders' Unit, which,
although a part of Oakalla Prison Farm, is in
a separate building. The present amendment,
which is requested by the government of
British Columbia, is merely to enable them
to transfer these young offenders from the

DECEMBER 1, 1952
Young Offenders' Unit to New Haven, and
vice versa, and between these institutions
and the Oakalla Jail.
An Hon. Senator: Where is New Haven?
Hon. Mr. Emmerson: I understand that it
and the Oakalla Prison Farm are in the New
Westminster district of British Columbia.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the honourable
member if he can tell us what changes are
intended by sections 147B, 147C and 147D?
They are in the bill, but no explanation of
them is given.
Hon. Mr. Emmerson: I am not learned
enough in the law to give the technical
explanation, but I know that these provisions
are necessary to authorize the transfer of
these young men, whether on determinate or
indeterminate sentences within the limits
specified in the Act.
Detailed information on this bill may be
secured in committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

1923, provision was made to enable insolvent

debtors, including corporations, to make proposals to creditors for the payment of claims
of the creditors without first going into bankruptcy.
The present position is, therefore, that an
insolvent company that wishes to make a
proposal to pay the claims of its creditors
may proceed, at its own option under the
Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act or
the Bankruptcy Act. It appears, however,
that a large number of companies which
might readily avail themselves of the facilities of the Bankruptcy Act, choose to make
their proposals under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act. The evidence is that
this is working to the disadvantage of creditors, particularly trade creditors, who not
knowing what assets are left in the company
accept whatever settlement is offered. It is
hoped that this bill will correct this situation.
Under both the Bankruptcy Act and the
Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act the
approval of the court is required before the
proposal is binding on the insolvent company
and the creditors. Under the Companies'
Creditors Arrangement Act, however, no

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. J. W. de B. Farris moved the second
reading of Bill Q, an Act to incorporate
Peace River Transmission Company Limited.
He said: Honourable senators, we have had

Hon. Mr. Roberison: Dispense!
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I insist on making my

speech.
This bill seeks incorporation of a very
modest company, whose total capitalization is
$500,000. To meet, in anticipation, a question of the leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig),
I would point out that the shares are $5
each, so that anyone wishing to buy sharesif there are any available for purchase-will
have the advantage of the low price from
the beginning.
Section 5, which is one of the important
sections, provides that the company will be
subject to all the limitations of any general
legislation enacted by parliament relating
to pipelines for the transportation of gas or
oil. The powers to be conferred under section 6 of the bill will be substantially the
same as those given to companies that have
already been incorporated by Act of Parliament.
This is primarily a pipeline company for
the transmission of gas; and being comparatively small, its operations will be of a limited
nature in the vicinity of the boundary of
Alberta and British Columbia.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I should like to make one
comment at this time about bills which have

During our discussions on these bills at the

certain governmental boards where they
could obtain authority to build pipelines to
specific points in the country. I was pleased
that permission was given to transport oil

from British Columbia to the seacoast. To
that, of course, no one could raise any objection. My only thought was that they should
not have gone into Vancouver with the plant,
but should have stayed on the Fraser River
side and built the refineries there.
Now this company is going down into the
States to build a $35 million refinery. I think
we should not overlook this trend of affairs.
Of course, I know that we must have the
assistance of large communities and of our
neighbours in order that gas may be brought
to the British Columbian coast, but we are
just at the beginning of the development of
our great oil reserve, and this is the first
pipeline through which oil will be exported.
When visiting California at the first of the
year I was surprised to see the hundreds of
oil wells operating night and day, and it never
occurred to me that our oil would need to
be exported to the United States.
I think the Senate would be well advised
to take another look at the general Pipe Lines
Act. In my opinion we have in this country
the greatest reserves of oil and natural gas
in the whole world, and nothing can keep
back the development of these tremendous
resources. In fact, the eyes of the world
are upon Canada. But I was a little disappointed when I learned that this company
intended to take our oil and divert it down
into the United States and build a $35 million refinery close to the boundary line. We
ourselves need the by-products from crude
oil-the fuel oil, the lubricants and other
things. Also, I am one of those who believe
that by refining the oil ourselves we can
give employment to many people. The oil
should be refined here in Canada, and what
we should export is the gasoline and any
other products that we ourselves cannot consume. I am opposed to what appears to
be the trend-the building across the line
of refineries for manufacturing products that
should be manufactured in this country.
I think that we in parliament should take

cognizance of what is going on, and I repeat
my suggestion that the Senate should perhaps
take another look at the general Pipe Lines
Act.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Farris: I do not know if honour-

able senators would wish to have this bill
go to committee. There is nothing much
that I can add to what has been said.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think it ought to go to

committee.

I agree with what was said by

the senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.

DECEMBER 1, 1952
Reid). There is in this country a very strong
feeling that we should be on strict guard
so as not to allow these natural resources to
go across the line. They are development
resources, unlike iron or steel or other
resources of that kind, and we need to be
very careful in dealing with them. We ought
to look the facts straight in the face. The
United States showed just this year what
they will do if they wish. I am persuadedI hope I may be wrong-that in some matters
the incoming government over there will
take firmer action than the present government has taken, and that if we export to the
States any goods that compete in price with
American products they will jack up the
tariff wall.
I think this bill should go to committee,
so that we may show the people of Canada
that we are looking into these things on
their merits.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am opposed to rushing
a bill through the house unless there is some
urgent necessity for so doing. I personally
would object to giving this bill third reading
without first having a reference to committee.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I would point out to my
honourable friend that the capitalization of
this company is $500,000.
The minimum
expenditure required to take natural gas over
to the United States would be $100 million,
so this company has no more relation to the
export of natural gas from the northern part
of British Columbia and Alberta than with

the export of gas from the moon. I would
move, honourable senators, that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills.
Hon. Mr. Haig: On that motion I can speak
also. My friend says that the company's
However,
capitalization is only $500,000.
there is nothing in the world to prevent
the company from applying here a year from
now and asking for an authorized capitalization of $500 million.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Well, we could deal with
that application then.
Hon. Mr. Haig: You would be the first one
to say "Oh, we passed on the principle of
this measure last year, and now we should
grant the company's request for a larger
authorized capitalization."
My honourable
friend's point does not influence me at all.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I did not expect it would.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Honourable senators,
I am not objecting to the reference of this
bill to committee, if that is the desire of the
house. I have only just now glanced at the
measure, and I should like one point made
clear. I take it that at the moment there is
no thought of exporting to the United States.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I think I made that plain.
The motion was agreed to and the bill was
referred to the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills.

Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not of course believe
that the present Prime Minister would throw
this country into the turmoil of a general
election just prior to the coronation. He is
much too able a man, in my opinion, to be
guilty of such a mistake, for if he did that
he would be challenging the Canadian people
who regard the coming coronation as a
religious ceremony in which a large part of
the freedom-loving people of the world dedicate themselves to a great cause. I am one
of the many who believes that the reign of
Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will be
written in the annals of history as one of
the great epochs in the progress of the world.
So much for the election.
Many subjects are discussed in the Speech
from the Throne. I do not intend to deal
with them seriatim, because most of them
consist of suggested legislation which will
or already has come before us. I want to
congratulate the leader of the house (Hon.
Mr. Robertson): I think he did a service to
the Senate when be persuaded his cabinet
colleagues to introduce in this house so much
legislation at a period of the session when
we can give attention to it and send it to the
other place in ample time for the members
there to give it careful consideration.
I have never been very enthusiastic about
the United Nations. I hate to say that, but
it is the truth. This is a matter of individual
opinion. I have not discussed it, nor do I
intend to discuss it with any member of my
party, nor in this matter do I speak as their
representative. It is said that the action of
the United Nations stopped aggression in
Korea. That is so, but only because the

Russian government was "in a huff", and
decided not to be represented at the meeting. Had her nominees been at the assembly
they would have vetoed action.
I do not say that I am opposed to the
United Nations Organization; I have not
reached a conclusion on the matter. I do
not think that one should oppose a body of
this kind unless he can suggest some better
way of meeting the problems it was formed
to solve.
I recognize that Russia-her
satellites also, but particularly Russia-use
the United Nations Organization as a sounding board for propagandizing the world's
peoples. At one time it seemed like a fine
idea on the part of Russia. The organization
was set up immediately after the second
world war, in the course of which Russia
had been helped by all the free world to
resist the attack of Germany, and it took us
considerable time to see the situation as
it really was. Today, so far as I can see,
Russian policy is serving the cause of anticornmunism in Canada, the United States,
Great Britain and other countries. By using
the United Nations sessions to spread their
propaganda they have only succeeded in
convincing our people that the Russian
policy and the Russian economy are not such
as the free world wants to adopt. It is a
common habit of mind in the United States,
Great Britain, France and probably other
western nations, to listen to what the other
fellow has to say: although we may be sure
we are right, we do not want to criticize
the good points of our adversary's case. Certainly since 1946 the world has had a surfeit
of the sort of thing Russia stands for; and
I defy anybody to point to a single person
who has been converted to communism
through the actions of the Russians and
their satellites in the United Nations
Organization. In that respect it can be said
that UNO is a great success, but not as an
agency to solve the problern the world
faces today.
I want peace: any of us who had boys in
the last war or served in the first war know
what war means. I should like to mention
a little personal experience. I asked a young
man, "What did you think about when you
got into your bomber to leave for the front?"
He was unmarried. He said: "I thought of
dad and mother when I said 'Let her go',
but I was thinking too that that night I was
going to kill fifteen or twenty fathers and
mothers; it was my job to drop about six
tons of bombs on Cologne"-or Dresden, or
Berlin, or Hamburg, or some such place.
When you hear a young man talk like that
you realize what a terrible thing war is. If
we can credit these stories from the United
States about the hydrogen bomb, it would

DECEMBER 2.
seem that after half a dozen of them had been
dropped there would be no Britain, no Holland, no Belgium, and very little of France.
We are standing on the threshold of that
kind of a world. It is a desperate situation.
The United Nations at least provides a temporary exhaust-valve which can be used
by the spokesmen of various countries in
their discussions, but I do not think it will
ever solve our main problems. I cannot see
how it is possible to solve them so long
as one part of the world refuses to let its
people see the other part of the world. It
would be a calamity if we in Canada refused
to admit people from the United States or
Britain or any other country. I would not
like to live here under those circumstances:
I would feel that something was fundamentally wrong. We of the western nations
benefit by letting people from elsewhere come
to our country. Incidentally I notice an
announcement that the Government will urge
all Canadians next summer to visit the
beauty spots of our own land. Some day,
though it may be a long time hence, the
inhabitants of these Communist countries
will realize that if the rest of the world is
not allowed to visit them, and they are not
allowed to see the rest of the world, there
must be something wrong with their system.
So much for the United Nations Organization. I do not say I am against it, I have
no counter-suggestion to offer; but I do not
want this country to depend on the United
Nations. We must be prepared to meet the
world situation as though UNO did not exist.
One point in criticism of this institution is
that hardly any of the member states are
represented in the armed forces in Korea.
The burden is borne mainly by the United
States, the British commonwealth, and
Turkey. The majority of countries voice
criticism of aggression, while doing nothing
about it. This has shown me, as I have
no doubt it has convinced others, that we
cannot depend too much on that system. That
Canada bas very little confidence in it
is proven by the part our country has taken
in building up and supporting NATO, supplying arms and munitions to Europe, and sending soldiers to Germany. So, I repeat, while
I cannot suggest anything to take its place,
dependence on UNO will not save us in a
crisis.
I do not intend to discuss defence expenditures fully, but I strongly feel that the amount
we are spending on war materials is too great
in proportion to the personnel of our armed
forces. I am of the opinion that in a great
many cases we have supplies that would
equip an army of a milion men instead of
one of 100,000, which we now have. Let
there be no doubt or misunderstanding about
68112--5

1952

the number of men serving in our armed
forces. It is only 1/36th of the number the
United States have. If we had the same proportion of men in the armed forces as there
are in the United States, they would number
300,000; and if we had the same proportion
as there are in Britain, they would number
225,000. This would have to be an enlisted
army, but the simple fact is that no party
in Canada, except in time of war-and it
would have to be a pretty busy war-will
give us conscription. They have conscription
in Great Britain and in the United States,
but we will not have it here, so there is no
use talking about it.
With the tremendous scientific development
that is taking place, the machines now being
manufactured will probably be obsolete in
five years. Let me give an illustration. When
a young air force man came back to Winnipeg
in 1945, I said to him, "There were not so
many killed in airplanes in the last three
years of the war". He said, "No, we had
radar and were able to bomb the enemy targets from an altitude of 20,000 feet". He
pointed out that fliers in 1941 and 1942 had
to bomb from 5,000 feet and were easier
targets for anti-aircraft guns. A Lancaster
bomber carrying a full load and flying at 275
miles an hour is obsolete today. Modern
fighter planes can fly rings around it.
The statement is made by the Minister of
Defence that we have got to be ready to put
men into the field and equip them properly in
case of war. Well, we did not make any such
preparations prior to 1914 or 1939. The
United States, Great Britain, Russia and the
low countries of Europe were unprepared;
yet they saw Germany rearming. We are
spending about $2 billion on our defence program, and I just wonder whether this stockpiling of great stores of supplies to be used
in case of war has gone too far. I know I
will be criticized, and that it will be said
I had no business making this statement
because a country should be prepared in case
war breaks out. I would point out, however,
that we will be quite unprepared if we go
broke in .carrying out this program.
I come now to the question of taxes, a subject that is as old as the days of the Pharaohs,
when tax collectors roamed up and down the
land. Our corporations tax is simply a
double tax on every shareholder in a corporation. Take a case in point. Let us suppose
that I own 100 shares of Hudson Bay Mining
and Smelting Company stock. The money
I have invested, together with that of other
individuals, has enabled this company to
become established. Let us say the company is now naking so many millions a year
profit: fifty-two per cent of its net profit

SENATE
is paid to the government in taxes. Therefore my dividends are reduced 50 per cent
to start with, and when I receive the balance
of 48 per cent the government taxes me all
over again on that amount. Now, if I had
my money in mortgages, bonds, real estate
or in any of the many other kinds of securities that do not pay corporation taxes, I
would get the whole 100 per cent and would
only have to pay income tax on that amount.
It is unfair that people who put money into
corporations should be taxed as they are now.
How can the economic system of this country
operate without corporations? I understand,
for instance, that some $14 million is being
spent on the development of the great Sherritt-Gordon mine in Manitoba. This capital
had to be raised by the selling of shares; it
could not be raised by individuals. The same
is true of the money raised to develop the oil
fields of Alberta. I have read that on the
hustings the C.C.F. bas advocated the imposition of a 100 per cent tax on corporations.
Well, who are the corporations? They are
just made up of little fellows who buy shares
in them. I know a man who bought a hundred
shares in Sherritt-Gordon. He wished he
could have afforded a thousand shares. He
wanted to invest some money, and that was
about the only kind of investment he could
make, except putting his money in a bank
and drawing 14 per cent interest.
I come now to the income tax. This
country has got to reduce this tax if its wants
to continue selling goods on the world market.
The issue in the coming election will be not
what has been done in the past five years,
but where we are going to sell our goods in
the next five. That is precisely why the
present conference is being held in London,
England. A government official announced
over the radio just today that Great Britain
is only going to take 10 million pounds of
tobacco from Canada. Last year she took
40 million pounds. She simply has not the
money this year. If we cannot sell our
tobacco to Great Britain, we cannot sell it to
anybody, and our tobacco producers will be
forced out of business.
The Minister of Finance has said several
times that be is quite prepared to reduce taxes
if somebody can show him where he can
reduce them without cutting out some
services. Well, an Edmonton housewife gave
the right answer. She said, "Why, Mr. Abbott,
I don't need to tell you how to solve that
problem. All you need to do is to reduce
the taxes, and the government will find a
way to cut down expenditures. If my husband
earned $500 a month we would live according
to a certain standard, but if he came home
and told me that his salary had been cut to

$300 a month, because business had fallen
off and the proprietor could not pay a larger
salary than that, I would not continue to
spend as if our income was still $500 a month.
Oh, no. I would cut our expenses to conform with our lower income, and I would
be the best qualified housewife in Alberta to
say what expenses should be cut." That is
so, and today the Honourable the Minister of
Finance would be the best qualified man in
Canada to say where taxation should be cut
if the government's income were reduced.
All that parliament has to do is to give the
minister $3 billion, say, instead of $4 billion,
and be will do the cutting. No person would
dare to say to any government "Cut out this
or that." The only thing that one can do
is to urge the government to cut down its
expenditures to a reasonable basis.
Our expenditures in this fiscal year are
larger than they have ever been before. They
are four times as large as they were in 1939,
and aside from the people that came in
through the union with Newfoundland we
have not a much greater population than we
had then. We are spending just as mu-ch now
as we did during the war, yet we have a
surplus of about $280 million. That is not
right. My children and grandchildren, and
your children and grandchildren, should pay
part of the cost of the struggle that we are
going through and have been going through
for some years. We fought from 1939 to
1945 to save this country. We did the best
we could in every possible way. Our young
men and women went to the war, some of
them unfortunately never to come back, and
the country as a whole gave freely of its
energies to help win the war. Yet today
we are going on and spending as if we haýd
to pay the whole debt of Canada instead of
leaving some of it to be paid by its future
citizens. That kind of thing simply cannot
be done.
No wonder the cost of living bas gone up so
high. At present, it is true, the figures indicate a slight reduction in the total cost of
living, but if you look at the reports that
come out every month you will see that it is
my friend the farmer from Rosetown (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) and my friend the farmer from
Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) and all the
other farmers and agricultural producers of
this country who are paying the shot. There
has been no reduction anywhere except in
the cost of primary products.
We had a magnificent crop in western Canada this year, one of the greatest we ever
had. It was fortunate for us, though unfortunate for other people, that Argentina,
Australia and other countries had poor crops.
Australia, India, Pakistan and Ceylon wanted

DECEMBER 2,
to become manufacturing countries instead
of grain growing countries, and so it happens
that this year we are fortunate in being able
to sell all the grain that we can get to seaboard. But that situation will not always
exist. The western states are threatened
now with dry weather, as we are in western
Canada, and what will happen next year
nobody knows. But in any event we cannot
hope that our farmers and other primary producers will continue to enjoy the good times
that they now have, unless something occurs
to cause the rest of the world to continue
buying their products-and I can see no
likelihood of that.
In the United States they have elected a
new government. Let us not blind ourselves
to the fact that all the free-traders in Canada
hoped that the Democrats would be returned
to office, with Mr. Stevenson as president.
They thought that General Eisenhower would
be inclined to go against free trade. Well,
General Eisenhower and his Republican party
got in. Whether the fears of Canadian freetraders were well founded or not, I do not
know, but I do know that the Republican
party, whether from choice or from compulsion, will want a tighter hand kept on the
strings of the United States purse from which
money is being paid out to Europe. No
country can indefinitely take such insults as
have been directed at the Unite-d States from
Europe-from Britain, France and other
countries-to the effect that the American
money they receive is charity.
Now I want to deal briefly with the question of trade. It is all right for anyone to
say he is in favour of free trade, but how
can you get free trade unless there is someone to trade with? It is quite plain that
unless the British people are willing to work
fifty hours a week and much harder than
they are working now, or unless we lend
them more money-and we could not do that
for long-they cannot buy our goods. That
may be regarded as a bold statement, and I
may be criticized for it up and down this
country, but it is the truth. We have got to
do the very best we can, work as hard as
possible, so that the people of Britain will
not be able to say, "Oh, in your present
fortunate position you can reap a bountiful
harvest because we sheltered you from destruction during two wars. But now you forget
about all that." Of course, there is no doubt
that Britain's action twice saved democracy.
We are in the midst of a struggle the like
of which the world has never known before.
Nearly all of us here were born before 1910
or 1915, when the old era died. Today people
everywhere are clamouring to get things out
of other people. The people of Iran do not

want to work. Why should they work, when
they have got so much oil? True, their oil
resources stood undeveloped for thousands of
years, until the British came along. In Iraq,
Egypt and other eastern countries the story
is very much the same. It seems to me that
we Canadians must realize that our hope of
continued prosperity depends on trade with
the rest of the world. Yet, today the rest of
the world has not got the kind of money that
we insist on receiving in payment for our
goods. It seems there will be a clash between
the two systems. I do not know what will
happen at the economic meetings now being
held at London, but I am sure that Canadians
must take a greater interest in the development of world trade.
I have not followed my notes closely, or
perhaps I would not have taken so long. I
wanted to say a word or two about tobacco.
A new American cigarette bas just come on
the market, selling at twenty for 33 cents.
The old price of Canadian cigarettes was 39
cents, but I see today that there has been
a reduction to 36 cents. In an office at
Toronto the other day I was shown two
cigarettes, a Canadian brand and this new
American one. The American cigarette was
made of dark, stubby tobacco, the Canadian
cigarette contained a light-coloured tobacco,
which our people like much better. This eut
in price is going to mean a great loss to
tobacco growers in Canada.
And we know what happened to the price
of sugar. A little more than a year ago we
entered into a contract with Cuba to take
75,000 tons of raw sugar a year for three
years. Although the agreement does not provide for the importation of granulated sugar,
it has been sent in, and our primary producers in Alberta, Ontario, Manitoba and
Quebec are not going to be able to compete
in the market. Our local production had
just commenced to increase. In the eastern
half of the province of Manitoba the sugar
beet crop-which is not yet on a very large
acreage-offers a diversification in farming.
For the information of the bouse I shall give
the production of sugar beets by the four
producing provinces. It is as follows:

I believe that Canada's purchases of sugar
from Cuba should have been put on a quota
basis, the same as that of the United States;
and under the Geneva Agreement that can
be done.
In return for the sugar, Cuba has agreed
to take from Canada codfish, wheat, flour and
seed potatoes. It is interesting to note that in

By this amendment, the clearing and breaking of land within reserves is included in the
purposes for which loans may be made.
Another of the proposed amendments follows from the discovery that there is no
provision in the Indian Act for the seizure
of minerals and other commodities which have
been unlawfully taken from a reserve. It is
now proposed to remedy this omission by
giving the authorities power to seize any
commodity which has been illegally removed
from a reserve; also power of search is given
to peace officers and other authorized persons.
I believe those are all the matters comprised
in the amendment to section 101. But, reading it over, I am not so sure that this is the
purpose of the section, or that it can be
accomplished through this amendment. The
clause reads:
Whenever a peace officer or a superintendent or
a person authorized by the Minister believes on
reasonable grounds that an offence against section
thirty-three, eighty-nine, ninety-two, ninety-three,
ninety-four or ninety-six bas been committed, he
may seize all goods and chattels by means of or in
relation to which he reasonably believes the offence
was committed. and he may enter, open and search
any place or thing in or upon which he reasonably
believes any such goods or chattels may be found.

This puzzles me:
-he may seize all goods and chattels by means of
or in relation to which he reasonably believes the
offence was committed.

MERCHANT SEAMEN COMPENSATION
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. J. Kinley moved the second reading
of Bill I, an Act to amend the Merchant Seamen Compensation Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
an amendment to the Merchant Seamen Compensation Act, 1946. The purpose of the bill
is to revise the rates of compensation payable to disabled seamen and dependents of
deceased seamen under the Merchant Seamen
Compensation Act, to bring them in line with
present-day conditions. I shall outline the
proposed amendments.
The Act is now administered by the Department of Labour, and the Act is to be
amended so that the term "Minister" will
apply to the Minister of Labour. The number
of days' disability before compensation is
payable is to be reduced from seven to four.
It is proposed that the Act be amended to
provide for the following changes in the
scale of benefits payable under the Act:
(a) increase the amount of the grant for burial
expenses for a deceased seaman from $125 to $200:
(b) increase the amount of the monthly payment
to the dependent widow of the deceased seaman
from $45 per month to $50 per month;
(c) increase the amount of compensation payable
for a dependent child under 18 years of age of a
deceased seaman where there is also a dependent
parent, from $10 per month to $15 per montb;
(d) increase the amount payable to a dependent
child under 18 years of age of a deceased seaman
where the only dependents are children, from $20
per month to $25 per month;
(e) increase the amount of compensation payable
to injured seamen from a minimum of $12.50 per
week to an amount of $15 per week;
(f) increase the maximum amount of average
earnings of seamen which may be used for the purpose of computation of compensation payable to a
disabled seaman from $2,500 per annum to $3,600 per
annum.

Under the Compensation Act 66§ per cent of
a seaman's earnings is the amount allotted
ior tne purpuse oi comuiputisg the comtpensation payable to a disabled seaman. This
amendment will mean that a disabled seaman,
according to his rate of pay, may get up to
$200 per month, or about $46.15 a week.
Paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection 9 of
section 30 of the Act are to be repealed and
the following substituted therefor:
(a) where the widow or an invalid husband is
the sole dependent, a monthly payment of fifty
dollars, or if the seaman's average earnings are
less than fifty dollars per month, the amount of
such earnings; and
(b) where the dependents are a widow or an
invalid husband and one or more children, a
monthly payment of sixty-five dollars for the
widow or invalid husband and one child irrespective of the amount of the seaman's earnings, with
a further monthly payment of fifteen dollars for
each additional child unless the total monthly compensation exceeds the seaman's average earnings
in which case the compensation shall be a sum
equal to such earnings or sixty-five dollars, whichever is the greater, the share of each child
entitled to compensation being reduced proportionately.

This would seem to indicate that a widow
and dependents of a deceased seaman cannot receive more in the way of compensation
than the average wages of the deceased
during the period on which the computation

of this compensation is based. The payment
of compensation is usually considered a civil
right in Canada, and as such it falls within
the jurisdiction of the provinces. However,
a merchant seamen compensation agreement
covering the entire marine industry would
naturally have to be national in its scope.
Therefore we must have a national Act of
compensation for merchant seamen. I understand that the authority comes from the
British North America Act itself, which provides that navigation and shipping matters
come under federal jurisdiction.
Each province in Canada bas a Workmen's
Compensation Act, with some provinces paying more by way of benefits than others. The
scale of compensation under the national Act
is the same as the scale found in the provincial Acts at present in force in Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward
Island, and New Brunswick. Most of the
claims under the Merchant Seamen Compensation Act now come from that portion of
Canada. Inland navigation does not come
under this Act, being covered by provincial
statutes which apply to the Great Lakes and
the St. Lawrence.
I am told that an employer is able to elect
whether he wishes to insure privately or
come under the provincial Acts. The obligation under the Act is that employers must

DECEMBER 2.
carry insurance so that they can pay compensation to disabled seamen, and dependents
of deceased seamen, in accordance with the
scale of benefits found in this bill. That is
done in different ways in different parts of
Canada. At present only sixty-six employers
come under this Act, and last year only fiftysix accidents were reported. In 1946, when
the statute was passed, it applied to 102
employers, and 188 accidents were reported
that year.
The Workmen's Compensation Acts of
British Columbia and Quebec provide that
the compensation payable to an employee who
suffers permanent total disability is 70 per
cent of his earnings. Under the Acts of
Ontario, Saskatchewan and Alberta the benefits in the event of permanent total disability
are even higher, namely, 75 per cent of earnings. However, it must be remembered that
the moneys payable to injured seamen under
the Act now before us are not the sole benefits
to which they are entitled. The medical aid
made available to seamen by the Canada
Shipping Act is a little better than what is
provided under provincial Workmen's Compensation Acts. In British Columbia most
of the seamen are insured with the British
Columbia Compensation Board. I believe
that was the result of a decision handed
down by the Privy Council, which held that
it was competent for the provincial authorities
to give this protection. As I understand it,
the British Columbia statute covers men who
are employed outside as well as within the
province. Therefore the Merchant Seamen
Compensation Act is not made much use of
out on the west coast.
The reason why more seamen are not covered by this federal Act is that a good many
Canadian ships have been sold abroad. and
many owned in this country are being operated under foreign registries. I think this is
an unfortunate condition for our merchant
marine.
The proposed changes in the legislation are
salutary. The purpose is to see that men
who make their living on the deep seas shall
be given the same protection as men who
work upon the land. The amendments are
not extensive. I notice that the present Act
uses the spelling "dependent", as does the
provincial legislation in Nova Scotia, Quebec, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and British
Columbia; whereas the bill before us spells
the word "dependant", in conformity with the
spelling used in the provincial statutes of
Ontario and Alberta. It seems to me that a
uniform spelling should be agreed upon, and
that this point should be considered in committee.
68112-6

1952

The Act is administered by a board consisting of A. H. Brown. Assistant Deputy Minister of Labour, B. J. Roberts, member of
the National Harbours Board, and C. Johnstone, of the Department of Transport.
The higher benefits provided for by this
bill will not bring about any increase in the
consolidated revenue account, for the employers will pay the shot. In the days when
workmen's compensation statutes were new
legislation-I was then a member of the Nova
Scotia Legislature-it was generally thought
that the whole cost of the benefits would be
paid by employers and that no contribution
at all would be made by employees. Of
course, that is not and never has been so.
In the first place, the maximum benefits
payable to an injured employee are only a
certain percentage of his earnings prior to
the accident. In Nova Scotia, for instance,
for an employee who suffers permanent total
disability it is two-thirds of his earnings,
and the other one-third represents his contribution. But for the Compensation Act he
could sue for 100 per cent of his wages. The
compensation statutes provide that the injured workman surrenders his common-law
right as against his employer. This does
away with the need for litigation, and is good
for stability and economy.
This federal Act comes into play only where
provincial statutes cannot prevail. In provinces where merchant seamen are not covered, the provisions of this Act are invoked,
when necessary.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Kinley: Honourable senators, I
move that the bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
TERRITORIAL LANDS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. James A. MacKinnon moved the
second reading of Bill K, an Act to amend the
Territorial Lands Act and to repeal the Yukon
Quartz Mining Act and the Yukon Placer
Mining Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
deals with two great territories of Canada,
the Northwest Territories and the Yukon,
and principally with a major industry in
those two territories, that of mining. Regulations in force in the Yukon and in the Northwest Territories differ, and it is intended by
this bill to make them uniform. For instance,
some of the Northwest Territories regulations
governing the method of staking claims and

SENATE

of developing them are entirely different from
the regulations governing the same matters
in the Yukon.
This bill will repeal the Yukon Quartz
Mining Act and the Yukon Placer Mining
Act, and will make the necessary amendment
to the Territorial Lands Act. Upon the repeal
of these two statutes the administration of
quartz and placer mining will be brought
under the Territorial Lands Act, which was
passed in 1950, and replaced the old Dominion Lands Act.
The Dominion Lands Act was first passed
in 1872. Except for quartz and placer mining
in the Yukon, to which reference will be
made later, it was the statute which governed
the disposition and administration by the
federal government of the lands and other
resources owned by it in the four western
provinces and in the Yukon and Northwest
Territories. Upon the transfer of the resources to the provinces in 1930 the Act continued
to apply to the Yukon and Northwest Territories only.
Except for certain special provisions relating to homesteads and school lands, the
Dominion Lands Act gave the Governor in
Council full aýuthority to pass regulations for
the sale and other disposition of all lands,
mineral rights, timber, and other resources.
Under the Act quartz and placer mining
regulations were established and applied to
both territories until the Yukon Placer Mining Act (1906) and Yukon Quartz Mining Act
(1924) were passed. With these exceptions,
and until 1930, the regulations applied to the
western provinces and the Northwest Territories. From 1930 they applied only to the
Northwest Territories. In 1932 the regulations were revised and brought up to date
and, subject to amendments made from time
to time, have continued in effect up to the
present time.
The present situation therefore is that all
federal resources, including the surface rights
and petroleum in the Yukon and Northwest
Territories are administered under the Act
by regulations, with the exception of quartz
and placer mining in the Yukon.
The Territorial Lands Act gives the Governor in Council the same powers to pass
regulations as were contained in the old Act.
Section 7 of the Territorial Lands Act
provides:
The Governor in Council may make regulations
for the leasing of mining rights in, under or upon
territorial lands and the payment of royalties
therefor, but such regulations shall provide for the
protection of and compensation to the holders of
surface rights.

The need for uniformity in the regulations

in both territories has become increasingly

apparent, particularly now that mining and
oil developments are taking place adjacent
to the common boundary line. There is also
a need to revise and bring up to date the
quartz and placer mining laws in the Yukon.
It is intended to revise the existing quartz
mining regulations now in effect in the
Northwest Territories and to make them
applicable to both territories. This can be
done when the proposed legislation is passed.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the honourable
gentleman whether all the mineral rights in
the territories mentioned are held by the
Dominion

government,

or

do

the mineral

rights pass with the transfer of land to a
new owner?
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: I am quite satisfied

that the Dominion Government was the
holder of title to all lands in both the territories; but any lands that have been disposed of through private indivi'duals-that is
in the Northwest Territories, and I think it
is the same in the Yukon-are now held by
the purchaser in his name, minerals excluded

SAINT JOHN BRIDGE AND RAILWAY
EXTENSION COMPANY BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. J. Hayes Doone moved the second
reading of Bill L, an Act respecting the Saint
John Bridge and Railway Extension Company.
He said: Honourable senators, the chief features of this bill are the repayment of a loan
and the resolving of certain rights.
The historical background may be briefly
stated as follows: The Saint John Bridge and
Railway Extension Company was incorporated by the Statutes of New Brunswick (1881),
44 Victoria, Chapter 44, with authority to
construct and maintain a line connecting the
Saint John and Maine Railway at Fairville,
New Brunswick, with the Intercolonial Railway at its terminus in Saint John, New
Brunswick. It was also authorized to construct a bridge across the Saint John River
as part of this undertaking. By Chapter 26
of the Statutes of Canada 1883, the company
was declared to be a work for the general
advantage of Canada.

DECEMBER 2, 1952
By the Act last mentioned the federal government was authorized ta make a loan to
the Saint John Bridge and Railway Extension
Company of $433,900 upon the security of
a mortgage on the entire assets and property
of the company. The loan was made, and the
mortgage was given by the company ta thé
federal government on December 10, 1883.
The loan was repayable in fifteen years, and
in 1898 under authority of Chapter 9 of the
Statutes of 1898 the maturity date was
extended for another fifteen years. No
further extension has been given, but interest
has been paid annually at four per cent.
The Canadian Pacific Railway Company
acquired a majority of the common stock of
the bridge company in 1905, and has for
many years owned all outstanding shares and
securities.
The Canadian Pacifie Railway Company
bas advised the government that it is now
prepared ta repay this loan and wishes ta
take an assignment of the mortgage. The
railway represents that it is necessary, upon
repayment, that all title of Her Majesty in
the properties mortgaged become vested in
the Canadian Pacifie and that its right ta
ownership of the shares and securities be
beyond question.
Although the bridge company is a separate
corporation, it is by ownership and operation
an integral part of the Canadian Pacific system. In view of this it is desirable that the
companies be given the powers contemplated
by sections 151 ta 153 of the Railway Act,
and clause 3 of the Bill is intended ta accomplish this purpose.
I may say that section 151 of the Railway
Act provides the machinery as between companies for the making of agreements of sale,
leases or amalgamations; it stipulates the
method of taking the vote, the making of
submissions ta the Board of Railway Commissioners and recommendations ta the
Governor in Council, and so on. Section 152
grants powers for amalgamation, and reserves
certain rights and privileges. Section 153 is
a saving section in respect of prior claims.

68112-61

This is a simple bill for the purpose of
enabling the Canadian Pacific Railway Company ta repay the loan ta the government and
ta have the title of Her Majesty in the
properties covered by the mortgage vested
in the Canadian Pacifie Railway Company.
The motion was agreed ta, and the bill was
read the second time.

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. W. H. Taylor moved the second reading of Bill R, an Act respecting Beaver
Fire Insurance Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a very
short bill. The purpose is ta change the name
of Beaver Fire Insurance Company, a company incorporated by chapter 68 of the
Statutes of 1913, ta "Beaver Insurance Company." The Beaver Fire Insurance Company,

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
before the orders of the day are proceeded
with I should like to make a few brief
observations as to the work of the house.
I regret that circumstances beyond my
control make it impossible for me to proceed
today with the debate on the Speech from the
Throne. Unfortunately, I must also ask that
Item No. 2 on the Order Paper stand. This
will result in a brief sitting of the house
today; however, it is not an unmixed blessing,
for it will facilitate the work of the various

DECEMBER 3, 1952
committees, particularly that of the sub-committee of the Banking and Commerce Committee, which is giving careful attention to
the Criminal Code Bill.
While I am on my feet, may I call the
attention of the house to a mistake in the
printing of the Order Paper for today. Item
No. 3 should read:
Second Reading of Bill (N), intituled: "An Act
respecting the appointment of Auditors for National
Railways."

NATIONAL RAILWAYS
AUDITORS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill N, an Act respecting
the appointment of auditors for National Railways.
He said: Honourable senators will recognize
this bill as one which comes before Parliament annually. It provides for the appointment of George A. Touche and Company as
auditors to carry out an audit of the accounts
of National Railways for the year 1953. Honourable senators will also recall that this
well-known and reliable firm of auditors has,
with I think one exception, undertaken the
audit of the Canadian National Railways
System since its inception in 1923.
Provision for the manner in which such
auditors shall be appointed is found in Section 13 of the Canadian National-Canadian
Pacific Act, 1933, as amended by Section 3 of
Chapter 25 of the Statutes of Canada, 1936.
In effect, it requires that a continuous audit
of the accounts of National Railways shall
be made by independent auditors appointed
annually by a joint resolution of the Senate
and the House of Commons, and that they
make an annual report to parliament in
respect of their audit.
The reason the annual Act appointing the
auditors contains the provision: "Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13 of the
Canadian National-Canadian Pacific Act . . ."
is that the appointment by joint resolution
of the Senate and House of Commons was
found to be too complicated and cumbersome
for practical purposes. In consequence, the
simpler method of appointing the auditors
annually by an act of parliament has been
adopted.
The bill is similar to all those previously
introduced for this purpose, with the exception of an additional clause to bring the Act
into line with the new Revised Statutes of
Canada which are expected to appear early
in 1953.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask whether, after
the passage of this bill, the appointment of
auditors will be automatic without reference
to parlianent?

Hon.
Mr.
Robertson:
This measure
authorizes the appointment of this firm as
auditors.
Hon. Mr. Reid: For any specific length of
time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: One year. Originally
the auditors were appointed by a joint resolution of the Senate and the House of Commons.
In its place, a bill is now introduced annually,
to cover the ensuing year only.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the, third
time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I move that it be referred to the Standing
Committee on Transport and Communications. While fuller information upon the bill
itself may not be required, perhaps some
honourable senators who are members of the
committee will be looking for information on
matters subsidiary to it.
The motion was agreed to.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from Tuesday, December 2, the consideration of His Excellency
the Governor General's Speech at the opening of the session, and the motion of Hon.
Mr. Vaillancourt for an address in reply
thereto.
Hon. Wishar McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, may I at once, as Mr. King used
to say, join with the honourable leader opposite in his felicitations regarding the coming
Coronation of Her Majesty the Queen. I
need hardly say that in his remarks he
voiced the viewpoint held by all loyal and
admiring subjects of Her Majesty, not only
within the commonwealth but throughout the
free world as well.
May I also join with the honourable leader
opposite in his complimentary remarks to the
mover and the seconder of the Address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne? I
subscribe heartily to what he said. The
speech of the mover, he said, reflected a great
deal of research, careful thought, wide
experience and many other qualities which
are valuable in dealing with the problems

which Canada today faces. I was intrigued
with the remark of the honourable leader
when ne sai. that nhe speech or the seconder
was one which might more properly have been
made in another forum than the Senate-I
believe he suggested the House of Commons-and by a member who was about to
seek re-election.
My recollection of the speech made it difficult for me to accept that viewpoint, so I
took the precaution in the interim of
re-reading what had been said. In my
opinion, in order to appreciate its importance
in a house such as our own, something should
be added by way of background.
The
seconder is one of the leading business men
of Eastern Canada, a man who was born
with no silver spoon in his mouth, but who,
like so many other successful Canadians,
inherited a good name and a great will to
work. Through diligence and industry he
developed one of Eastern Canada's outstanding businesses in foreign products. He accomplished this by exceptional mastery of detail
and, above all, by careful financing. I suppose that he budgeted much as the government of Canada does. Sometimes he was
confronted with an unexpected surplus, sometimes with an unforeseen deficit. But it is
my guess that when he found himself with
an unexpected surplus he did not fritter it
away, but used it in paying off existing
obligations, if he had any, or deposited it in
the bank against a rainy day. In addition to
business-building and financing he had to
attend to the selling part of the job, in which
from time to time he met with some successes
and some sizeable reverses. Having for many
years disposed of his products mainly in the
British market, he suddenly found that market gone. But there was no moaning or
groaning: he proceeded at once to adapt himself to the changed circumstances, built
another plant to produce products for the
American and upper Canadian markets, and
met with great success. In due course the
Prime Minister invited him to accept an
appointment to the Senate, and it was my
privilege, as a fellow Nova Scotian, to ask
him to second the motion for the Address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne. It
seems to me wholly natural that a man with
the background I have sketched should stress
the features which, to his mind, characterize
the government of the day, namely sound,
safe financing, and the use of unexpected
surpluses to reduce the public debt. While
private industry does not expect a government to find markets, it appreciates governmental help in securing them.
The honourable senator pointed out that,
apart from the fact that careful financing pays

DECEMBER 4, 1952
dividends, it has other beneficial effects as
far as personal taxation is concerned. He
gave the instance of a married man with two
children and having an income of $3,000. In
1948 his tax was $230; in 1952, only $130, part
of which goes to provide for an old age
pension of $960 to himself and his wife.
It seems to me, honourable senators, that
the honourable senator's speech contained
the essence of sound goveramental finance
and sound government policy in regard to
trade. He said that such a policy is what
encourages capital to come in from outside,
and that it has paid good dividends to the
ordinary taxpayer of today, and I ask, honourable senators, is there any more fitting
theatre than the Senate for a doctrine of this
kind? I suggest that it is suitable to the
Senate, the House of Commons or to any
theatre within or without the walls of parliament.
I know that the views of the leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) are different. He has
expressed the thought on several occasions
that no political speeches should be made
in this chamber. It is his right to express
his views on this question, but I would
remind honourable members that it was not
ever thus. When I first came into this chamber the members sitting opposite were very
much more numerous than they are today,
and I remember well the slashing attacks
made on the government of the day by
the late Senator Ballantyne, my honourable
friend's predecessor. It was certainly a matter of politics on his part, but I think he was
quite right in making such speeches. It
seems like only yesterday that I listened to
the rapier-like speeches of the honourable
gentleman from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder),
whose remarks in this chamber were as
penetrating as anything I ever listened to.
I confess that as a government supporter I
often squirmed in my seat when he spoke,
but my natural antagonism was greatly softened by my intense admiration of his skill.
I remember well the masterful attacks made
by the honourable senator from Peterborough
(Hon. Mrs. Fallis), even though they were
tempered with such an excellent flow of
English and manner of presentation that I
was always at the point of forgiving her.
The honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) has himself been in rare fornm on
occasion, and many a time I have observed
many of my supporters just waiting for an
opportunity to reply to him. The honourable senator from Blaine Lake (Hon.
Mr. Horner) is a faithful follower of his
leader, but I would rather suspect that before this debate is over he will have something to say about a certain part of his
leader's address-and as government leader

in the Senate I have the comfortable feeling
that my able colleagues will be ready and
willing to reply to any attack he may make on
the government.
I would remind the house that the leader of
the opposition in the Senate is one of the
shrewdest and ablest political figures in Canada. I would be prepared to say that from
the point of view of experience, shrewdness
and brains he is the leading figure in his
party today.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: My honourable friend
knows quite well-and here he proves his
shrewdness-that if any matter came down
to a bitter political debate backwards and forwards, in a house that is so terribly lopsided
from the point of view of party affiliations as
this one it could hardly receive reasonable
and fair consideration. So my honourable
friend, with that political astuteness which
characterizes him-and the more I see of him
the more I think of his astuteness-feels that
it would probably be well not to emphasize
the political side of any issue, hoping that the
latent ability of the colleagues around and
behind me here will show itself by their
fighting with one another. I suggest to my
honourable friends that they do not take too
seriously the admonition of the leader of the
opposition, but use their own judgment as
to whether they will speak politically or not.
I certainly would find no fault with anybody
on either side of the house for doing that.
I was much interested in my honourable
friend's address. Indeed, the more I read it
the more I saw in it; and that, among other
reasons, was why it seemed to me that I
should take an extra day in the careful preparation of my own remarks. His speech
was very moderate in tone, as honourable
senators know, in keeping with his own
admonition; nevertheless, it expressed a very
definite viewpoint, or could perhaps be taken
as expressing a very definite viewpoint, on
two of the major political issues in this
country. Reading his speech in conjunction
with speeches by members of his party,
whom I heard over the radio the saine night,
I should expect that his address had been
prepared after some consultation with various members of his party in parliament.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, no, none whatever.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Well, at least he
reflected the same viewpoint as they did. I
will put it that way.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I was only thinking a little
faster than they were.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: That simply confirms
my view that my honourable friend is the

SENATE
leader of the members of his party, and that
they will adopt today what he said yesterday.
The two questions with which he deait
principally were defence and trade, including
markets. I agree with my honourable friend
that these may well be two issues in the next
election campaign.
Let us deal first with the question of
defence. Running through the speech of my
honourable friend was the same theme which
ran through the speeches of the three members of his party who spoke over the radio, a
relating of the total expenditures on defence
to 100,000 men in uniform.
The radio
speakers, I felt, sought to give the impression
that by dividing the total defence expenditures by the number of men in the Canadian
army one got an average figure of approximately $11,000 per man, whereas a similar
calculation on a similar basis for the American army would show a figure of approximately $22,000, -which, I suppose, is one way
of suggesting that the provision for Canadian
soldiers is superior to that for Americans.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The figures were the other
way around.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I will quote from the
Montreal Gazette an Ottawa dispatch dated
December 2:
While
regarded
for each
against
spenders
when it
of forces

United States defence spending was
as lavish, the estimated 1952 expenditure
United States man in uniform was $10.756,
$22,035 in Canada.
Canada's "liberal"
made the Americans "look like pikers
comes to the cost of defence on the basis
in being."

I am not sure just what I said, but that is
what I intended to convey.
Hon. Mr. Wood: You reversed the figures.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: That relates the total
expense to the number of men in the active
force. But that is not what my honourable
friend did. He said, as I remember it-and
he will correct me if I am wrong-that he
thought the total expenditures on defence,
including armament and everything else, were
too large in proportion to the total number of
men that we have in uniform, and that this
total might possibly be reduced. His
approach is perhaps more difficult to answer
than the other one, and this again bears out
my contention that ie is the leader in his
party and is more astute in these matters than
are the other parliamentary members of his
party.
Now, honourable senators, on the contention that our expenditures per 100,000 men
in the active army appear too large, may I
say just a word or two? It is no secret, for
the minister bas stated it time and again, that
the basis of our defence force is not a large
army, nor indeed a large navy. Owing to

the peculiar circumstances in which we are
placed in Canada our emphasis has been on
a very large air force, with a striking force
of parachute troops, as being the most effective method-if there is an effective methodof defending ourselves against a possible
aggressor from the north. The view bas been
that in this age enough men could not possibly be found to constitute any effective
defence in the wildernesses of the north. And
of course, when you put your emphasis on an
air force, you have to be prepared for terrifle
costs. Everything pertaining to a modern air
force is very expensive. For instance, a sabre
jet, which carries only one man, costs about
$300,000. Air fields are another very costly
item, as are ail the various paraphernalia
which have been developed in recent years to
lessen the loss of life and to increase the
skill of our armed defenders in the air. So
of course our total expenditure cannot help
being extraordinarily large in relation to the
number of men in our army, which has purposely been kept relatively small.
Also, this line of criticism leaves entirely
out of consideration the fact that, rightly or
wrongly, the government bas decided to stockpile against a possible emergency, so that we
may not be caught again, as we were in 1939
and at the beginning of the first war, with
practically no equipment or even clothing for
our troops when mobilized. That is part of
the government's policy on defence, and any
analysis of the total defence expenditures
must take it, as well as ail the other relative
factors, into consideration.
But there was another point which, in my
opinion, was of even greater significance. It
remains to be seen whether my opinion on
it is right or not. My honourable friend
came out quite definitely for deficit financing of our war expenditures. He pointed out
the fact that our total outlay on defence is
beginning to come fairly close to what it was
in the peak years of the last war, and since
part of the cost of waging the war was passed
on to future generations be thought it would
be a good idea to follow a similar policy with
regard to our present expenditures on defence.
If that becomes the fixed policy of my honourable friend's party, there will be quite a
difference of opinion about it. Some will support it, no doubt, and sincerely. But I think
it is only fair to say that during the first war
we capitalized practically ahl of our expenditures, whereas, during the second war, the
deliberate policy of the government was to
capitalize and pass on to future generations
only about one half of the expenditure, the
purpose being to keep the amount of the war
debt payable in the future down to the lowest
possible level. There was some criticism of
this policy, but it was the policy of the day.

DECEMBER 4, 1932
Our total expenditures having reached the
sum they have reached today there naturally
follows the question: Why do we not
capitalize part of the cost and save the
present taxpayer some money? That is an
argument, and perhaps a logical one in some
respects; but I think that before passing on
obligations to coming generations, or as it
were ceasing to live within our income, we
should determine our ability to pay. Indeed,
our ability to pay has in a large measure
been governed by our total expenditure on
armaments. We should perhaps bring to
mind the tremendous change that has taken
place in the economy of Canada during the
recent years. Today the yardstick popularly
used for budgetary purposes is the gross
national product; it is more and more being
used by the Department of Finance for the
estimating of budget requirements.
I find no fault with the total expenditures
as given by the leader opposite. As honourable senators know, our budget this year for
defence purposes is slightly more than $2
billion. It is interesting, however, to note
that in 1942-43 the budget was slightly less
than $1,900 million; in 1943-44 it was $2,674
million; in 1944-45 $2,962 million; and in
1945-46 it was less than $1,983 million.
Ability to pay is the important point that
must be kept always in mind when considering total budgets for expenditure and the
question of whether or not we should defer
payments and pass on obligations to future
generations.
Today, as I have said, the yardstick for
determining ability to pay is the gross
national product, which for 1952 is $22,500
million. It is interesting to note that in 1939
our gross national product was only $5,700
million; and that in 1943-44, the peak of the
war years, when our expenditures totalled
$2,674 million, our gross national product
still was only $11 billion, or approximately
one-half of what it is today. In the year
1945, with expenditures of $2,900 million,
our gross national product was slightly under
$12 billion.
It is obvious why, when we are attempting to arrive at our proper proportion of
responsibility with our NATO allies, the gross
national product of our country, or our ability
to pay, comes directly to the fore. Honourable senators k.now that there are those
among the NATO countries who think that
Canada's appropriation is not large enough,
and they attempt to prove it.
The Prime Minister has recently stated
that ten per cent of our gross national
product is today devoted to defence. I would

point out that in 1943 and 1944, the years
to which my honourable friend referred in
his remarks, our defence expenditure was
twenty-five per cent of our gross national
product. Now, honourable senators, I have
no doubt that if a crisis were to arise in this
country tomorrow, and it should become
necessary for us to devote to war measures
twenty-five per cent of $22,500 million-or
roughly five or six billion dollars a year-the
policy which my honourable friend proposed
would be followed in whole or in part by
whatever government was in power. But,
always bearing in mind our ability to pay,
I suggest to my honourable friends that it is
not the part of wisdom to pass on obligations
to future generations and to go into debt in
the process.
The honourable leader opposite spoke of
the election to office of the Republican party
in the United States. It is a well known fact
that that party strongly criticized the Democratic party's policy of deficit financing with
respect to defence. How much that criticism
affected the popular vote, I do not know, but
it was very definitely a ground of attack by
the Republican party, whose members urged
that under normal circumstances the budget
should be balanced. So much for defence.
I have another important point to mention,
and I hope I am not taking up too much time
of the house.
Some Hon. Senators: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I listened carefully to
what my honourable friend said about
markets. He emphasized the fact that Britain
was not able to find money to buy from us,
and said that now the Republican party was
in power in the United States he was certain
that sooner or later that country would seek
protection for its own producers. Indeed, he
recalled in a rather ominous way the period
when, as a result of the termination of the
reciprocity agreement, Canada was formed
and the government soon afterwards adopted
the National Policy. I hope that my honourable friend did not have in mind the recommending of a similar procedure to his party.
If his party wished to adopt a national policy
such as was invoked in those early days, and
it continued to advocate multilateral trade,
I would find no fault with it politically, but
I suggest that there is no question as to the
stand taken by the government of which I
am a member. We are out to increase in
every possible creditable fashion the trade
of Canada in every market of the world,
without any if's or but'sSome Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Robertson: -and we are going to
do our utmost to induce other governments
to proceed along those lines.
The honourable leader opposite made
specific reference to what he seemed to think
was an ill-advised treaty between our government and the government of Cuba regarding raw sugar. My honourable friend said
that the contract provided only for the importation of raw sugar, and he left the impression
that granulated sugar also was coming in,
to the detriment of the sugar beet producers
in Canada; or, in any event, that the treaty
had not produced what the Canadian people
had hoped it would. I was not sure of the
facts in this matter, so I made inquiries to
ascertain what the situation really was. I
am informed that, as a result of the original
Geneva trade agreements and the favourednations policy, we became a beneficiary in
the Cuban market, not because of what we
sold there but merely because we were a
signatory to the agreements, and that we got
the treatment which Cuba extended to other
countries with whom she was doing business.
A careful reading of my honourable friend's
speech shows that the figures of our exports
which he quoted are confined to three export
items, and do not include commodities.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Those are the ones specified
in the contract.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Just a minute. I will
come to that point a little later. To begin
with, our market for fish, potatoes, and
various other items sold to Cuba existed as
a result of concessions given under the Geneva
trade agreements.
During the first five
months of 1951 our total exports of fish
and all
other products amounted
to
$15,328,000: our imports from Cuba in the
same period were only $3,856,828. I repeat
that this was before the contract was entered
into, and as a result of the Geneva trade
agreements. At the Torquay conference the
Cuban delegates took a very tough stand.
They said, "We simply will not continue this
agreement unless you are prepared to do
more business with us." Remember it was
$15 million on one side to $3 million on the
other. So, to retain the market provided
under the Geneva trade agreements, the
Canadian Government agreed to import 75,000
tons of raw sugar; there was no question of
granulated or refined sugar. What has happened as a result? In the first nine months of
1952 our exports to Cuba were valued at
$18,535,000, and our imports from that country, at $15,176,000, the latter, to the extent
of almost $10 million, consisting of raw sugar.
Coincident with but in no way related to
the agreement to buy raw sugar, but rather
as a result of the existing variation of prices

of raw material since the Korean incident
began, Cuba has been shipping into Canada
refied

sugar it

excess U

Llie existeît parity,

and with no relation to this specific agreement. Today there is a world surplus of
sugar, and sugar producers, I am advised, are
experiencing what seems to be an inevitable
consequence of extremely high prices for
raw materials, namely accumulations of large
stores followed by drastic readjustments. But
I point out that this state of things has no
direct bearing of any kind on the contract we
made with respect to raw sugar. The sources
from which we have been importing raw
sugar were, in the main, the British West
Indies and other parts of that area which
are not British territory.
So, when all is said and done, I think the
speech of the honourable leader of the opposition, (Hon. Mr. Haig) though marked by the
shrewdness which one expects in him, is
an able presentation of a particular political
viewpoint. My honourable friend, I repeat, is
one of the shrewdest men in public life today.
I pass now to the matter of security legislation. Canada has one of the best security
programs in the world, whether it be judged
from a purely humanitarian aspect or by its
advantages in stabilizing our economy for
the years ahead. I have no doubt that there
will be much talk of a program of health insurance. I believe that the constitutional
and financial problems involved, coupled with
a lack of necessary facilities, make precipitate
action undesirable. It might well be that
if over-hasty action were taken, those who
expect benefits would be grievously disappointed, and the effects upon our economy
might be serious.
May I now make brief reference to the
transfer payments to the provinces. This is
a matter which affects my own province
along with the others. Now that Ontario
bas signed its agreement, the estimated total
cost is about $300 millions. In spite of the
evident benefits to the recipients, some of
them criticize the principle of collection by
one government and disbursement by another: they argue that a province should
possess the right to the revenues and should
be allocated the necessary taxation field.
In theory that idea bas much to commend it,
but the difficulty is that up to the present no
satisfactory means of putting it into practice
has been evolved. Meanwhile the provinces
are enjoying great benefits. Whether it be
good or bad, I do not believe that the principle of the receipt by provinces of a large
share of over-all revenues from the federal
government is a new one. Despite the very
large contributions made under the transfer
payments to, for instance, Nova Scotia, I
doubt whether the proportion of provincial

DECEMBER 4, 1952
revenues from federal sources is higher than
it was shortly after confederation. It may
be that this situation, in one aspect or another, is an inevitable consequence of the
federal system.
Now I want to refer to another matter
which is very much in the public mind, and
will, no doubt, be widely discussed as we
approach the next general election. I refer
to taxation. As is well known, our current
budget is of the order of four and a half
Of this sum
thousand million dollars.
approximately one and three-quarter billion
dollars is devoted to social security, debt
charges and transfer payments to provinces;
more than two billions go to defence, and
administrative expenditures absorb the balance, about $670 millions. It was to be expected
that this budget, and the expenditures for
which it provides, would be attacked by the
opposition. It is so attacked, and rightly so.
That is one of the functions of an opposition.
I doubt whether any future government
will make a change with respect to transfer
payments to the provinces, social security
and debt charges.
At the present time our administrative
expenses are $670 million. I am not unmindful of the recommendations that have been
made by the Senate Finance Committee as
to possible achievement of savings. I can
assure you that the government has taken
these recommendations into consideration and
will continue to do so in an effort to effect
every possible economy. It might be argued
that a new government, on the principle that
a new broom sweeps clean, would make
greater reductions than the present government is making. From a dollar and cent
point of view a change in government might
be all to the good, but if the various demands
on the part of opposition are sincere, a change
could well result in the saving of a dollar on
one expenditure but the addition of a dollar
and a half to another. Over all, I do not
think there is likelihood of much change.
The chief factors in the incidence of future
taxation are two in number: one is defence
expenditure and the other is the level of
Canada's prosperity. As to the question of
defence, Russia's attitude and actions leading
up to Korea were responsible for our defence
expenditures and those of our allies. Until
we are sure that the danger of an all-out war
is past it would be folly to neglect an adequate
defence program. Russia has recently adopted a new attitude. She has now ceased to
talk about the inevitability of war between
herself and the capitalist nations, and is
claiming that there is more likelihood of war
between certain of the capitalist nations
because of trade differences. If this results

in less sword waving, more co-operation, and
a possible armistice in Korea, western governments will have difficulty in convincing their
taxpayers of the necessity for defence expenditures. Real disarmament would provide a
solution, but this is unlikely, since Russia
will never agree to an inspection, and the
allies will never agree to real disarmament
without inspection. At the moment it would
appear that an adequate defence program
will be necessary for a long time to come.
Huge defence expenditures are facing every
country, including the United States, and I
can think of only one real approach to the
baffling problem of maintaining adequate
defence protection. The NATO countries are
bound together by solemn agreement for their
mutual defence. In other words, we sink or
float together. I may not be too accurate in
my figures, but I would say that the NATO
countries together provided over $50 billion
for NATO forces alone this year. It is my
guess that with the additional expenditures
beyond this, the total spent by NATO countries this year reached $70 or $80 billion.
Much of this expenditure is bound to be
uneconomical because of the lack of standardization of equipment, and for other reasons
such as the duplication and lack of adequate
checks and balances. This sort of thing is
inevitable when even Great Britain and the
United States cannot agree on the question of
a uniform rifle. Imagine the cost involved
in maintaining different types of firearms,
ammunition and so on! I have good authority for saying that when General Eisenhower was NATO commander he was credited
with the statement that if he were dealing
with one government instead of several he
could provide better defence at half the cost.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: When the United
Nations organization was formed it was hoped
that it would provide all armaments. This
was impossible, but something approaching
this in principle will have to be worked out
by NATO. Our best hope for adequate
defence at the least cost will have to be
found in some new form of international
co-operation with our allies.
I want to deal now with the possible
change in the level of prosperity, which is
something that will have a great bearing on
taxation. As I said a few minutes ago, our
gross national product today is $22J billion.
In 1949 it was $16j billion, and in 1939 it
was something just over $5 billion. What
will it be tomorrow? Corporations do not
pay income tax unless they show profits, and
individuals do not pay income tax unless
they have the necessary income. The level

SENATE
of taxation of those in a position to pay will
be greatly affected by the level of prosperity.
I can assure the house that as long as this
government is in power it will never budget
for a deficit in relatively normal times. It is
quite possible that deficits may come up
unexpectedly, just as surpluses do, but that
is another story.
What will be the gross national production
tomorrow? Will it be up or down? What
will it depend on? The answer will depend
on whether the NATO partners can increase
their trade with each other and with the other
nations of the non-communist world. To my
mind, it is just as simple as that. Most will
agree with this, but the difficulties in the
way are tremendous. Economic nationalism
is here, as it is elsewhere, to an amazing
degree, and it will increase as competition
increases. As individual businesses in NATO
countries feel competition, they will demand
protection. If their governments succumb,
this will invite retaliation-and retaliation
brings retaliation, and we will become fourteen water-tight compartments as far as
trade is concerned, with the inevitable result
as far as our economics are concerned.
This is just exactly what Stalin is counting on in his new policy. Members will
remember that at the Moscow conference in
October-the first since 1939-Stalin prepared
a clear-cut statement as to the future of the
world, in which for the first time since the
revolution, he expressed the opinion or at
least dropped the suggestion that war was
inevitable. At that time, dealing with, among
other things, this very question of economic
co-operation, he made this significant statement as to what was in his mind and what
was bothering him most so far as the western
countries are concerned:

and raise the flag of national independence
and sovereignty. He said-and this is an
exact quotationIf you do so you will become the leading force
in your respective nations.

I have deliberately repeated his words just
for the sake of emphasis.
The situation we can look forward to,
apparently, is that the campaign for political
and economic isolationism will be spearhcaded in the future by the Communist party
in each of the NATO countries. There is an
old saying that "Politics makes strange bedfellows."
If the communists do head this
campaign, what a spectacle that will present.
It conjures up in one's mind the picture of
Colonel Robert McCormick, publisher of the
Chicago Tribune, arm in arm with the leading communists parading down Michigan
Boulevard, chanting in unison "America for
the Americans" and "Corne home, Yanks,
come home." It even has possibilities here
in Canada. Perhaps in the future we shall
be treated to the spectacle of our leading
proponents of economic nationalism tuning
their voices with the communists, on some
crowded street corner, in a modern rendition
of the old theme song "No truck nor trade
with the Yankees."
Yes, honourable senators, make no mistake
about it, the obstacles to our goal are many.
What the NATO countries need on the part
of their governments is strong, bold leadership. It cannot be vacillating and halfhearted. It must be strong, positive, and
such as is likely to strike the imagination of
free people everywhere. That is desirable in
every NATO country, but, more than in any
other, in the United States.
It occurred to me that in his speech the

However, I soon recovered from that feeling,
I repeat, honourable senators, that he told for I hold the view that the United States of
them to go back to their respective countries America have assumed such a position of

DECEMBER 4, 1952
leadership in the world that, regardless of
what political party happens to be in power
at Washington, they could not put on the
cloak of political or economic isolationism
without thereby causing the western world to
collapse. And it has seemed to me-though
perhaps this view is born of hope-that in
the short space of time since the election
there has been increasing evidence that
President-elect Eisenhower and those associated with him will give to the world a
degree of leadership, both political and economic, that may perhaps startle us, or some
of us, and certainly strike our imagination.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: It remains to be seen
whether that is a correct view, but every
day gives increasing reason for believing
that it may be. General Eisenhower knows
better than any other man the weaknesses of
our military set-up. He was the leader of the
federation in western Europe. I doubt if he
will be found taking a negative attitude
towards those major questions on which the
future of mankind depends.
However, honourable senators, as I have
said before, I have doubts as to whether,
with the best will in the world, co-operation
of the sovereign countries alone can accomplish what has got to be accomplished. And
that brings me back to the resolution that
was moved in 1950 by my far-sighted friend,
the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler), and passed almost unanimously
in this house. I doubt if we senators appreciate the influence which that resolution has
had on public thinking throughout the world.
Let me recall to the house the wording of
the resolution:
That the Senate of Canada approves of the calling
of a convention of delegates from the democracies
which sponsored the North Atlantic Treaty and
representing the principal political parties of such
democracies, for the purpose of exploring how far
their peoples and the peoples of such other democracies as the convention may invite to send delegates, can apply among them within the framework
of the United Nations, the principles of federal

union.
When we think of the huge expenditures
we are making for the NATO combined
forces, with as little civilian control as now
exists, and when we think of the need, for
approaching the question of trade on some
other basis than from a purely national viewpoint, emphasis is given to the idea that
some new instrument will have to be forged
to meet the present situation in world affairs.
I again remind honourable senators of the
powerful impact of our resolution of 1950.
I really think we do not realize how far its

influence was felt. I can say this, that a
gentleman who is soon going to hold a position of great responsibility in the United
States government remarked within my hearing, "The Senate of Canada does not know
how right it is." I think we ought to keep
the initiative.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I should like to suggest to my honourable friend from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) and others interested that
we give further consideration, in the light
of present events, to the question that he
initiated in 1950, and that he apply his fertile
brain to the drafting of a new resolution in
keeping with these more difficult times. I
can assure my honourable friend that for
such a resolution he would find today an
audience more receptive than the one which
greeted his splendid, effort of 1950.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: While speaking of this
subject to a friend sometime ago he asked
me: "What did the resolution that was passed
in the Senate mean? Was it a government
resolution?" I told him that it was not a
government resolution but was moved and
seconded by two independent senators. My
friend queried me as to what eacfi gentleman
had in the back of his mind. I said, "I can
only refer to what the individual senators
have said". Upon being asked what my
opinion was, I frankly said that I was free
to express my views without responsibility
to the government or anyone else, and that
I supported the resolution.
May I now set out my belief as to what
can be accomplished within the spirit of the
resolution?
(a) Western Germany should be brought
into NATO as a full member.
(b) Since all members of NATO have in
effect waived their sovereign rights in
solemnly agreeing each with the others, that
if one is attacked all are attacked, common
sense demands that our defence shall be
as effective and as inexpensive as possible,
and that the economies of each shall be so
strengthened as to make it possible for each
to make adequate contribution.
Honourable senators will note that I am
not putting this on humanitarian ground, but
on its merits.
(c) I believe that the present basis of civilian
control of the gigantic NATO armed forces
being set up by the joint expenditure of $50
billion annually has too shaky a foundation,
and is entirely inadequate to create, maintain and direct its future policy and action.

SENATE

Overseas communications have always been
a serious problem, first to the Empire and
subsequently to the British Commonwealth
of Nations. I can remember in my childhood
hearing it mooted that submarine cables
would be laid from London to all the
dominions and colonies. With the advent of
overseas wireless telegraphy and wireless
telephonic communications the cable soon
became technologically obsolete.
When the first signal from Ireland was
received on Signal Hill, a lofty promontory
overlooking the city of St. John's, Newfoundland, difficulties immediately arose by reason
of the expense of communication by cable.
Rates dropped immediately, and financial
difficulties threatened the cable companies.
There followed in 1929 the depression which
brought further financial complications to
overseas communication systems.
Immediately after the Second World War
Lord Reith made a tour of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and as a result a
conference of financial advisers was called to
meet in London in 1947. The conference
made certain recommendations, and if I
may, I shall summarize them from certain
documents before me. They are as follows:
(a) Each country to retain all receipts on
originating traffic, less out-payments to carrier companies handling such traffic.
(b) Each national body to make payments
towards expenses of the Commonwealth Telecommunications Board, based on the proportion of its receipts to the total net receipts of
all national bodies.
(c) Each national body to make wayleave
payments to the central board towards the
over-all expenses of maintaining and operating all common user cable and radio services

(d) I believe that, since more than half
of the total dffenre appropriations of all
NATO countries collectively are now devoted
to the central defence forces, we might well
consider having NATO do all, just as it was
originally hoped that the United Nations
Organization would.
(e) Since the strengthening of the economics of each member nation is of such vital
importance, and can only be satisfactorily
accomplished by the removal of the barriers
to the flow of multilateral trade, our objective
should be complete freedom of trade between
the member nations, accomplished progressively over a period of, say, ten years. Appropriate arrangements could be made with
those with whom we trade outside NATO.
(f) Since it is quite obvious that the setting
up of a central military force and the accepting of the principle that when one is attacked
all are attacked, is quite inconsistent with
fourteen foreign policies, each going its own
way, and charged with utterly unforeseeable
consequences, a common foreign policy is
absolutely essential.
(g) I believe that these common objectives
can only be achieved through the forging of
some new constitutional instrument to which
all NATO members will subscribe.
Hence, my personal support of the Senate
resolution passed in 1950. Without committing itself to any definite plan, the underlying principle was there that the ingenuity
of free men would be called upon to meet
even greater danger than military aggression
from Russia, and that some solution must
be devised to save the free world and
humanity itself.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: Honourable senators, I
move that the debate be adjourned.

DECEMBER 4, 1952
Each nation of the commonwealth suggested a manner of handling the shore problems. In Canada, after investigation, it was
decided that the best method was ta create
a Crown company ta take over the Marconi
Company as it applied to overseas telephonic
communications, and the British-owned company, Cable and Wireless Limited, as far as
it concerned cables. For the management of
these two corporations the Minister of Transport introdiuced in the other place a bill,
which was assented ta on the 10th of December 1949. The amount of money involved
under this bill was $4,500,000, of which four
million was required ta purchase the assets
of the Canadian Marconi Company and Cable
and Wireless Limited as far as applied ta the
overseas communications. The Wireless and
Cable assets almost in their entirety belong
ta the British Government. This corporation
was then set up and has functioned since
June 7, 1950. In the last six and a half
months of that year they had what in departmental language is known as an excess of
income over expenditure, amounting ta
$87,470. In the following year, 1951, according to the corporation's annual report, they
made $195,680. .
The bill we are now asked ta consider is
to amend the Overseas Telecommunication
Act of 1949 by removing the mandatory
requirement that the Canadian Overseas
Telecommunication Corporation shall pay
annually to the Receiver General an amount
equal to its operating profit, also the provision requiring payment ta the corporation
of an amount of money equal to its operating
loss, such payment ta be made from moneys
appropriated by parliament for that purpose.
This amendment would permit the corporation to accumulate a surplus each year for
capital development and expansion purposes.
Late last year there was passed through
this house the Financial Administration Act.
All Crown corporations are governed by this
over-riding "mother" act.
A comparison of the terms of this measure
with relation ta the Financial Administration Act shows confusion in some respects.
I do not think that this is the place to point
out what they are, but I suggest that the bill
should be examined by the appropriate committee.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Before the motion for second
reading is put, may I ask two questions?
Can the mover explain ta us why the profits
of the corporation are ta be retained, and
why the requirement ta report annually ta
parliament has been deleted.

Hon. Mr. Davis: I do not think there is
any significance in the statement that profits
are ta be retained An amendment of this
year ta the Income Tax Açt, section 74A,
provides that all corporations listed in Schedule D of the Financial Administration Act
are subject to federal corporation taxes.
These Crown corporations which are now
required to pay corporation taxes are the
following: Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Canadian Farm Loan Board, Canadian
National (West Indies) Steamships, Limited,
Canadian Overseas Telecommunication Corporation, Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation, Eldorado Mining and Refining
(1944) Limited, Export Credits Insurance
Corporation, National Railways as defined in
the Canadian National-Canadian Pacific Act,
1933, Northern Transportation Company
(1947) Limited, Northwest Territories Power
Commission, Polymer Corporation Limited,
Trans-Canada Air Lines.
The Canadian Overseas Telecommunication
Corporation, along with these other Crown
corporations, is required ta pay federal corporation taxes effective from January 1,
1952, and the COTC has actually made instalment payments of $10,814 per month
January ta June, with similar payments ta
be made for the remaining six months. The
federal corporation income tax payments for
the year 1952 ta the Receiver General are
estimated ta amount ta $129,758. In consideration of this routine, it is felt that the
corporation should be allowed ta retain any
surplus in order ta put itself in the position
of developing internally without recourse ta
further votes from the Crown.
Regarding competition, I may say that the
Canadian Overseas Telecommunication Corporation receives about 95 per cent of its
business from the Canadian Pacific Railway
Telegraph Company. By a strange coincidence,
which is quite explicable, the Canadian
National Railways Telegraph Company gives
its overseas messages ta a foreign corporation,
the Western Union Telegraph of the United
States.
The Canadian Overseas Telecommunication
Corporation is in a competitive position and
would like ta have its funds retained in its
treasury.
I have pointed out that in respect of financial administration there are some contradictions between this bill and the Financial
Administration Act that I think should be
resolved.
Hon. Mr. Reid: What about the annual
financial report ta parliament? Will it be
dropped and, if so, why?
Hon. Mr. Davis: The Financial Administration Act provides that a financial statement

SENATE
be rendered to parliament each year. The bill
before us anarentlv contradicts this, so I
would suggest that legal minds should be set
working to unravel this contradiction and
other matters contained in the bill.

SALACIOUS AND INDECENT
LITERATURE
APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE

Hon. J. J. Hayes Doone moved:
That a special committee of the Senate be
appointed, authorized and directed to examine
into all phases, circumstances and conditions
relating to the sale and distribution in Canada of1. Salacious and indecent literature;
2. Publications otherwise objectionable from the
standpoint of crime promotion, including crime
comics,
treasonable and perversive tracts and
periodicals;
3. Lewd drawings, pictures, photographs and
articles whether offered as art or otherwise presented for circulation.
That without limiting the scope of its inquiry,
the committee be authorized and directed to
examine into(a) Sources of supply of the above noted items;
(b) Means and extent of distribution thereof;
(c) Relative departmental responsibility for entry
or transmission;
(d) Sufficiency of existing legislation to define
terms in relation thereto;
(e) Relative responsibility for law enforcement
and effective legal measures of dealing with this
problem.
That the said committee be composed of the
Honourable Senators Bouffard, Burchill, David,
Davis, Doone, Duffus, Fallis, Farquhar, Gershaw,
Golding, Horner, Lacasse, McDonald, McGuire,
McIntyre, Pratt, Quinn, Stambaugh, Stevenson,
Vaillancourt, Wilson and Wood.
That the committee have the power to send for
persons, papers and records, and to secure such
services and assistance as may be necessary for
the proper prosecution of its inquiries.
That the said committee shall report its findings
to this house.

He said: Honourable senators will recall
that during the last session of Parliament a
special committee of the Senate-similar to
that proposed in the resolution before uswas set up to inquire into the sale and distribution in Canada of salacious and indecent
literature.
This committee held six meetings. In
addition it received and recorded briefs,
recommendations and resolutions numbered
in hundreds and representing millions of
Canadian citizens. Throughout its inquiry,
as was stated in the language of its report, an
intense public interest was displayed. Church
officials and religious groups of all faiths tendered enthusiastie approval. Social, civie and
business organizations in all parts of Canada
commended the work in progress, and a fullhearted and sustained support was accorded
by the press.

That publie concern has in no way diminished may be gauged by the fact that during
the parliamentary recess many national conventions of church and social bodies continued
their studies of the problem presented through
publication and dissemination of obscene and
salacious material. By resolution and otherwise they have urged upon the Senate a continuance of its efforts to seek a workable
solution. Requests to this effect have been
received from the Roman Catholic Church in
Canada, the Baptist Convention of Ontario
and Quebec, the Free Methodist Church in
Canada, the United Baptist Convention of
the Maritime Provinces, and the Canadian
Council of Churches, the latter representing
the following religious and social organizations: the Church of England in Canada, the
Baptist Federation of Canada, the Churches
of Christ (Disciples), the Evangelical United
Brethern Church, the Presbyterian Church in
Canada, the Reformed Episcopal Church, the
United Church of Canada, the Salvation Army,
the Society of Friends, the National Council
Y.M.C.A., the National Council Y.W.C.A., and
the Student Christian Movement of Canada.
Many similar requests have been forwarded
by affiliated organizations, including the
Catholic Women's League, Home and School
and Parent-Teacher federations, Women's
Christian Temperance Union, Leagues of the
Sacred Heart, Catholie Action and Holy Name
societies. Associations of Mayors and Reeves
and those representative of labour, have displayed an equal interest. The demand, therefore, is not local or restricted; it is nationwide and impressive.
It might also be of interest to record similar
activities in other areas. During the recess
a request was received for a complete record
of proceedings of the Senate investigation on
this matter from Mr. E. C. Gathings, Chairman of the House Committee on Current
Pornographie Materials, Washington, D.C.
According to a communication received from
the office of the Under Secretary of State for
External Aff airs, the Canadian Embassy in
Washington advises that the Select Committee of which Mr. Gathings is chairman was
due to convene in the House of Representatives in Washington on December 1 to pursue
its investigation.
These comments may in some measure
indicate the broad range of thought which
this problem has provoked and, in consequence, the timeliness of our own inquiry.
Should any further evidence with respect
to this feature be required, it may be found
in a press report from Sydney, Australia,
appearing in The Ensign under date of
August 9, 1952. This report advises that
comie strips and books published in the

SENATE
United States came under fire last week at
a conference of Australian state premiers, and
that, similar to the situation in Canada, protests against the sale and distribution of
salacious comics poured in from all sectors
of the commonwealth. The outcome of these
protests was the scheduling of a special conference of state authorities which will parallel
the Canadian Senate's committee on salacious
literature. It is reported that Prime Minister
Robert G. Menizes told the Premier's conference that the only way to keep undesirable
literature out of Australia was by censorship.
Speaking on the subject matter, a director of
the Sydney C.Y.O. informed the premiers that
the reading matter involved is causing moral
devastation among the youth of the country.
The Australian Director General of Education has formed ia special committee of
investigation.
Under the same date it is reported by The
Ensign that in Manila the Philippine Bureau
of Customs state that the United States military bases on the island are funnelling-in
points of much obscene literature. This was
giving the board much concern and remedial
measures were being sought.
Indicating the further global nature of
protest and investigation on this matter, it
is reported in the Christian Science Monitor

of June 5, 1952, that a group of educators and
legal experts at a conference on press, radio
and cinema for children, and under the
auspices of the United Nations Educational
Scientific and Cultural Organization, reached
the conclusion that comic books are turning
the youth and adolescents of today into young
ruffians and potential criminals. The delegates at this conference represented twentyfour countries, including Great Britain, India,
Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands, France,
Belgium, Switzerland, Spain and the United
States. They were opposed to censorship and
urged the banning of publicity posters which
might prove too suggestive. The distinction
between censorship and banning was not
explained, but the constructive suggestion
was made that offensive types of literature
might be replaced by clean adventure stories
and educational reading.
That the matter is engaging world thought,
and that the public conscience is acutely
aware of the moral and economic dangers
incidental to the problems, are statements
that need no further extension. But it is
equally evident that public opinion, however
insistent, can have no remedial effects unless
there are legal enactments adequate in their
restraint, and enforcement of them conscientiously carried into practice by those
charged with the responsibility.

The duty of the proposed committee is to
search into such factors and to make requisite
recommendations.
The motion was agreed to.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from Thursday, December 4, consideration of His Excellency the
Governor General's speech at the opening of
the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr.
Vaillancourt for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
may I first of all congratulate the mover and
the seconder of the Address (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt and Hon. Mr. Hawkins) on their eloquence and the splendid subject-matter of
their speeches.
Also at the outset I should like to say a
word about some of the new Canadians who
have come and been welcomed to our country
and are making Canada. their permanent
home. They are strangers in a strange land.
Service clubs, school boards and other bodies
are doing a good work in trying to educate
these people, trying to give them an opportunity to learn our language and our Canadian ways. It is an inspiring sight to see
these people, with their many-coloured costumes, attending night classes, week after
week, and it is even more inspiring to hear
them singing our patriotic songs and our
national anthem. Their instructors are doing
an excellent job, and they have the satisfaction of knowing that these newcomers are
showing evidence of their loyalty to the
Crown and their deep affection for our gracious monarch Elizabeth II.
.Now, honourable senators, taxes are high
in Canada. We have heard a good deal about
high taxation, and constantly there are drives
to reduce public expenditure. I just wish to
express at this time and hope that these will
not interfere with the irrigation program
which has been well started. Structures have
been built to store up the waters of the
mountain streams, so as to make them
available for the thirsty lands in the drought
stricken area. These structures will endure
and be a great blessing to the people who
come after us, enabling them to avoid much
of the despair and poverty which the pioneers
lived through because of continual crop failures. The work should be continued.
One subject that I wish to discuss is national
health insurance. As recently as August of
this year at the Trades and Labour Congress
meeting in Winnipeg a resolution was passed
demanding a general nation-wide health
insurance scheme. That organization felt that

DECEMBER 8, 1952
many people were denied hospital and medical care because of its cost. I should like to
have heard some elaboration on that resolution, for I believe that hospitals and doctors
have for the most part been quite generous
with their services. However, other labour
and agricultural groups have passed similar
resolutions, and the question of health insurance has been discussed in parliament. No
party seems to be against the proposal, and
indications for the most part are that the
public would be receptive to some national
health insurance plan.
The question of national health insurance
has come to the fore today by reason of the
increased scope of hospital and medical care
and the cost of providing it. Today general
practice includes antiseptic surgery, aseptic
surgery, intravenous treatment, blood transfusion, electro-cardiographs, X-rays, and, the
use of radium both for diagnosis and for
treatment. The result of the wide use of these
facilities in practice bas increased the average
life span from about fifty years at the turn
of the century to approximately sixty-eight
years today. Along with this marvelous progress has come such an increase in the cost
of medical attention and hospital care that
prolonged illness spells financial ruin to the
ordinary family.
The ethical responsibility of the medical
profession is to render necessary service to
all, regardless of ability to pay. I believe
that the services of doctors and nurses have
been given generously, in the best tradition
of their great calling. However, in the days
when a doctor required only a stethoscope
and blood pressure apparatus, medical attention was comparatively simple; but today the
doctor is called upon to make complicated
blood tests, take basic metabolism tests, use
electrocardiographs and X-rays, all of which
make his services much more difficult and
therefore more costly. The time has come
therefore, for some protection by a prepaid
scheme. A small fee at the time the services
are rencered would make a patient feel more
free to call for help, but it should not be used
as a deterrent.
A petition is being circulated throughout
Canada today asking for the immediate
introduction of a national health insurance
scheme. Before this demand can be met,
certain things must be considered. First,
under our constitution the provinces bear
the major responsibility for health services,
and before a health system could be uniformly applied by the federal government,
an amendment to the constitution would have
to be made. However, I do not foresee that

step being taken in our time. A second proposal which bas been made is that the federal
government give a per capita grant to the
provinces by way of a contribution towards
the plan. The objection to such a proposal is
that the taxing body would not be the spending body. The third and possibly the best
proposal would be the extension of the
present health policy of the government of
Canada.
As honourable senators know, that policy
was started in 1948, when some $30 million
was made available on an annual basis for
health services; $13 million was earmarked
for hospital expansion. Money was made
aviailable for the treatment of venereal disease and tuberculosis, for cancer research,
training personnel and conducting surveys
along certain lines, and for giving aid, to
crippled children. These expenditures were
for the most part to be made on a fifty-fifty
basis as between the federal and provincial
jurisdictions.
This scheme, by and large, has worked
very well. An additional 40,000 hospital beds
have been provided. The big Aberhart Sanatorium in Alberta has been completed by the
province, with $600,000 of assistance from
the federal government. Such an arrangement may well be the basis for the setting
up of a national health plan.
The cost of a nation-wide health insurance
scheme is perhaps worthy of consideration.
I am sure that nobody today knows what
the cost of an all-embracing scheme will be.
For instance, while Great Britain estimated
her financial outlay for such services to be
£160 million per year, during the third year
of the period the cost was more than £450
million. In Canada also there is considerable
variation in costs from province to province.
For instance under the provincial hospital
scheme in Saskatchewan there is a charge of
$10 per single person and $30 per family,
while in British Columbia the fee is $27 for
a single person and $39 per family, and in
addition there is a small charge of $1 per
day while the patient is in hospital. A subsidy is 'required to keep the Saskatchewan
scheme going.
Honourable senators, I am speaking on this
subject tonight because I want to place certain definite figures on the record. In the
province of Alberta 31,383 pensioners and
their dependents are eligible to receive hospital and medical care. The minister concerned
with this service in that province bas written
me stating that the average cost in 1951 was
$50 per person and that while the cost of
hospital accommodation was $8.40 per day,
only $6.40 was paid, and that the doctors
received about 52 per cent of their regular

SENATE
fees. It becomes apparent that if regular
rates were charged the cost would be approximately $80 per person per year for the allembracing medical care which the province
of Alberta provides for this ýclass of pensioners. To place this scheme on a national
basis for our 14 million people would involve
an aggregate cost of $1,120 million per year.
True, this would not all be new money,
because we all pay something by way of
hospital and doctor bills each year, and this
would be not necessary if we were insured.
Perhaps this is not a fair example, because
most of these people are over sixty years
of age and practically all of them would
qualify under the means test.
It is notable,
however, that under the Alberta scheme no
provision is made for drugs or medicines
except while the patient is in hospital; some
dental care is provided for pensioners, and
half the cost of new dentures is met. It
is apparent that $1,120 million as an estimate
is perhaps too high, but on the other hand
$600 million, as the minister suggests, is
definitely much too low.
I think it may be safely said that it is
impossible to get an accurate figure, for so
much depends on the scope of the benefits
that are given. For instance, what are you
going to do about referrals? If a man is
referred for some special treatment to, say,
Rochester, are you going to pay his expenses
and his medical fees there? What are you
going to do if an epidemic sweeps through
the country? Are you going to give people
in the distant regions of the north, where
they can be reached only by airplanes, the
same attention that people get in the cities?
And where are you going to draw the line
regarding the drugs and appliances that will
be used?
So at the present time the problem is
difficult and uncertain. Nevertheless I feel
that it is an obligation of the government in
Canada to make available to every person in
the country the very best medical and hospital care; and further, it should be our aim
to bring it within the reach of the ordinary
individual without ruining him financially.
As I see it, that can only be done by some
prepaid scheme of insurance.
Of course, difficulties arise. For instance,
in one province a compulsory hospitalization
scheme had been in operation only a relatively short time when it was found necessary
to institute some 1,297 prosecutions for nonpayments of fees, and the wages of 5,815
people were garnisheed. That is one unpleasant feature of this kind of compulsory scheme.
I want to bring to your attention an experiment which has been tried out in southwestern Saskatchewan. There they set up

Swift Current Health Unit No. 1. There are
in this area about 50,000 people, most of them
in small towns and rural districts, with about
forty to forty-four doctors.
Under this
scheme a single man pays each year $17,
a married couple without children, $27, a
married couple with one child, $34, and
a family including more than three children,
$40; in addition, 2.2 mills are levied on the
assessed property of the district. This operation has given at least some definite information, and the benefits have been so attractive
that the great majority willingly pay their
premiums. In fact, 95 per cent pay voluntarily; the municipalities are liable in respect
of the others. I have received full particulars
from the Secretary-Manager, Mr. S. Robertson, of Swift Current. I find them very valuable, because they show that the scheme
provides fairly definite benefits covering the
whole field.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Do I understand from the
bonourable senator that the people of the
district are satisfied with this scheme?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: They seem to be. I
inquired particularly about that. One evidence of it is that payments are willingly
made. People have a free choice of doctors
within the territory; and the benefits they
receive just about equal in cost the amount
they are paying.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Is the honourable gentleman convinced that a scheme of this kind is
much more practical than a national scheme
of health insurance would be?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: I would say that Canada
is not prepared as yet to adopt a national
scheme. I intend to refer to that matter
later. I think we need to get information by
experiments in a small way before we start
on a more comprehensive scheme.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Is the honourable senator
aware of the system which exists in the
province of Manitoba, and could be give us
an idea of how it works?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: In Manitoba there are
two types of health insurance, one hospital
and the other medical. There, as in other
provinces there is a trans-Canada medical
service under which every person who pays
a premium is entitled to medical care for
the year to which the premium applies. But
it is not compulsory.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I am told that it works very
well.
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: Yes, I think it does.
I will bring that out a little later.
A word as to the attitude of the Canadian
Medical Association. They have by resolution declared themselves in favour of a pre-

DECEMBER 8, 1952
paid medical scheme, and they are willing to
consider any scheme which will contribute
to the health and welfare of the Canadian
people. They point out, however, that more
than medical and hospital care is required.
The people should have adequate nutrition,
good housing, education, a safe milk supply,
a good water supply, and healthful working
conditions. Furthermore, the association insists that any scheme should encourage progress towards better and better medical care,
and that the doctor-patient relationship which
bas existed for so long must be maintained.
There are certain changes of which we
must take notice. In 1911 5 -64 of the people
of Canada were over sixty-five years of age;
today 9.2 are over sixty-five. How bas this
change come about? For centuries the prominent place among causes of death was held
by infectious diseases-typhoid fever, pneumonia, septicaemia and children's diseases.
These have been pretty well controlled by
modern practices of medicine. But diseases
which attack people in later life-cancer,
and what might be called the cardio-vascular
group-have not been controlled to the same
extent. The old saying that "a man is as old
as bis arteries" bas some truth to it. The
life expectation of men or women over sixtyfive bas not increased much in recent years,
because these particular diseases to which
they are subject have not come under control. However, as someone bas said, "If we
cannot add more years to life we can add
more life to years". We can add more life
and happiness by improving the condition of
the afflicted.
To sum up, our ideal is to have the best
possible care available to everybody. The
problem is how to get this. I do not think
that the introduction of a national health
insurance scheme at the present time would
be the quickest and most satisfactory way.
Six of the nine provinces reporting are not
yet ready for such a plan, and I feel that
there is insufficient 'experienced personnel to
manage it; at best it would be a compromise.
I believe there is a much better trail to the
goal we wish to reach. From l million
to 2 million Canadians are already protected
by such schemes as the Blue Cross and the
trans-Canada medical scheme, which are
already in existence. The government should
look into the workings of these schemes, and
if they are meeting the need they should be
expanded. If necessary, the federal government should pay the premiums in part or in
whole for those who cannot pay themselves.
This principle bas already been established
by many of the provinces who pay for the
health care of their pensioners.

If these plans are inadequate let each province set up a trial unit like Swift Current
No. 1. We would then know exactly what
we are undertaking, and men would be
trained for management of the larger scheme.
I would suggest that $30 million should
continue to be made available in order that
more research into arthritis and degenerative
diseases, which cause such havoc in older
life, could be carried out. Those who are
partly or totally disabled at any age should
receive a pension. They are the people whose
lives are darkened and whose hopes are
dimmed. They must depend on charity and
friends. Their lot would be made much
happier by a small regular pension of their
very own.
Finally, honourable senators, I would say
that these matters should receive top priority
because they are of such importance. If
carried out they would relieve human suffering and add greatly to the happiness and
contentment of the Canadian people.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, I move
the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to, and the ýdebate
was adjourned.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. A. K. Hugessen moved the second
reading of Bill A-1, an Act to incorporate the
Mercantile Bank of Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
rather unusual bill in the sense that it is the
first time for many years that legislation bas
been introduced into parliament for the
organization of a new chartered bank under
the Bank Act. The form of the bill is -comparatively simple, purporting to constitute a
number of prominent gentlemen, who are
named in the first paragraph, as incorporators of the Mercantile Bank of Canada. It
prescribes that the authorized capital of the
bank shall be $3 million, divided into 300,000
shares of $10 each, and that the chief office
of the bank shall be located in the city of
Montreal.
The petition in connection with this legislation is presented on behalf of a Netherlands
banking organization known as the Nationale
Handelsbank N.V., which bas its head office
in Amsterdam.
Until the transfer of
sovereignty to the Netherlands East Indies,
the Nationale Handelsbank N.V. was known
as the Netherlands Indies Commercial Bank.
This bank was established in Amsterdam in
1863 and is principally concerned with the
financing of trade. Besides the head office in

SENATE
Amsterdam, the bank maintains offices only
in the two other principal cities of Holland.
It is distinct from the so-called "Big Five"
banks, which operate an extensive branch
banking system in that country. Nevertheless,
the Nationale Handelsbank is a substantial
organization.
J hold in my hand a statement of this bank's
condition as of January 1, 1952, from which
it appears that its capital and reserve amount
to 56 million florins, the equivalent of
approximately $17 million, and that its total
assets are approximately 450 million florins,
equivalent to about $120 million. Those seeking this charter are therefore apparently substantial financial people.
This bank conducts an extensive banking
organization in the Far East, with branches
in Indonesia, India, Singapore, Hong Kong,
Thailand and Japan. Through its head office
in Amsterdam, its extensive banking organization in the Far East, and its various correspondents throughout the world, the bank is
well equipped to serve the needs of world
trade and commerce.
It is felt that the Mercantile Bank of
Canada, with the knowledge and experience
which can be supplied to it by the Nationale
Handelsbank-having in mind the growing
requirements of Canada and of the countries
in which Nationale Handelsbank has its business interests and connections-will develop
from a modest start into a useful organization
for the growth and development of international trade connections of Canadian
organizations. The present plan, if parliament sees fit to grant the charter, provides
for the establishment of the head office in
Montreal; but almost immediately a branch
will be opened in Vancouver, because of the
extensive banking and investment interests
of the Nationale Handelsbank in India and
the Far East.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: What is the matter with
Toronto?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: In due course branches
are likely to be opened in other cities in
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I was asking the hon-

ourable gentleman, "What is the matter with
Toronto?"
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I think Toronto ranks
as another city in Canada, does it not?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: It is doubtful.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I am going to suggest
that the bill, if given second reading, be
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, where the proponents of

the measure will be asked to appear and
justify the application they are making to
parliament.
I would, however, direct the attention of
the house to the fact that before it can commence operations this organization will have
to comply with the very stringent requirements of the Bank Act. Perhaps it might
be well to mention a few of these requirements. The first is that the bank has to
have a paid-up capital of not less than
$500,000. Secondly, it is not allowed to commence the business of banking until it bas
obtained from the Treasury Board a certificate permitting it to do so-and honourable
senators are aware of the nature and constitution of the Treasury Board. Thirdly, no
such certificate shall be given by the Treasury
Board until it has been shown to the board's
satisfaction that all the requirements of the
Bank Act and of the special Act of incorporation of the bank as to subscriptions of capital stock, payment of subscriptions, and so
on, have been properly complied with.
Honourable senators, I think that is all
that it is fair or useful for me to say at
this stage. I simply repeat that should the
house see fit to give the bill second reading
I will move that it be referred for consideration to the Standing Committee on Banking
and Commerce, at which all further explanations that may be required will be forthcoming.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Honourable senators, I
notice that the sponsor of the bill did not
attempt to make any argument as to the
need for this or any other additional bank in
this country, and I would like to ask him now
if he wishes to say anything about that. I
think we are sufficiently served with banks
at the present time.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I do not know that it
is so much a question of need as of desirability, in view of the expansion of this
country's international trade. I was trying
to point out that the Netherlands interests
behind this bill have very extensive connections in the Far East, and that it is
hoped the organization of this bank will make
possible the development of greater trade
between Canada and the Far East. That is
the reason why it is said that it is proposed
to open a branch in Vancouver almost at once.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I wonder if the sponsor of

the bill would mind explaining section 5? It
says:
This Act shall, subject to the provisions of section
sixteen of the Bank Act, remain in force until the
first day of July, in the year one thousand nine
hundred and fifty-four.

DECEMBER 8, 1952
Does that mean that the bank would have
to come back to parliament in July 1954 for
a renewal of its charter?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes. The reason for
that is, as the honourable senator will recall,
when lie thinks of it, that under the Bank
Act the charter of every chartered bank in
Canada is for a term of only ten years. The
Bank Act, under which all these charters are
given, has to come before parliament every
ten years, and it so happens that the term
of the present Bank Act runs until the
lst of July 1954. That is the reason for the
particular clause which my honourable friend
quoted.
Hon. Mr. Vien: On the question raised by the
honourable senator from Blaine Lake (Hon.
Mr. Horner), as to the need for an additional
bank, I just wish to suggest that that need is
something which cannot be demonstrated as
simply as it can be shown that two plus two
are four; but I think that when one considers
the vast financial and economic expansion
that has recently taken place in Canada, and
in our trade with foreign countries, the need
for additional banking facilities, particularly
in the mercantile field, becomes quite obvious.
At one time there were as many as 17,000
banks in the United States, and I believe
that at present there are some nine or ten
thousand. The banks in that country, of
course, particularly those in the federal bank
system, are unit banks. In Canada we have
only ten banks, each of which, as we know,
has a considerable number of branches. These
banks and their branches are rendering a
tremendous service throughout the country,
but I think that the usefulness of an additional bank of the kind proposed in this bill
can hardly be challenged.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Well, honourable senators, besides our branch banks we have a
large number of credit unions and lending
.companies now doing business. Our chartered
banks themselves are pretty well set up
to take care of banking for trade purposes
throughout the whole world. If it were
argued that we are receiving a large number
of settlers from the Netherlands and that
the opening of this proposed new bank would
make it possible for bankers from that country to continue to serve their own nationals
here, that argument would appeal to me.
Otherwise I do not see any need for the bank.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
it seems to me that in banking, as in every
commercial field, competition is the life of
trade. I have been somewhat concerned
because for a number of years we have had
no new banks opening up in this country.
As a matter of fact, notwithstanding the
commercial and other growth that has gone

on in Canada in recent years, as was just
pointed out by the Senator from De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Vien), the number of banks has
decreased since I was a young man.
I should like to ask the sponsor of the bill
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) whether there is any
possibility of the proposed bank doing not
only an international commercial business
but also invading the domestic or local field
in Canada, in which I would prefer to see
much more competition :than there is now.
There are in Canada some people who look
on our banking system as a great monoply.
I observe with some pleasure that our banks
are exceedingly prosperous. In our big cities
and towns they buy up every good corner
and erect palatial buildings thereon. That is
a fine thing, but it does look as though the
banks were rather more prosperous than the
rest of Canada, and, sometimes one wonders
whether they enjoy special privileges which
allow that condition to be maintained. I
should be pleased if the sponsor of the bill
could tell us that this new bank will also
conduct a domestic or local business in Canada
as well as an international business.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Honourable senators, I
was going to ask the sponsor of the bill
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) if lie could say whether
or not the class of business that would be
done by this proposed new bank would likely
involve any amendments to our Bank Act.
Before he answers that question, I wish to
make a brief comment, arising out of what
has just been said by the senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), about
our existing banking system. I think we are
all bound to agree that during the war years,
particularly while the Foreign Exchange
Control Board. had charge of so much of the
business that was being done in Canada, our
banking system did a tremendous job for this
country and, got very little in return. Now
that the Foreign Exchange Control Board
lias been abolished and our processes of
exchange are operating through the ordinary
channels, our banking system is meeting the
situation very well, and the banks are perhaps making a bit more profit than they did
in the period froma 1940 to 1950.
I think that competition from the proposed
Mercantile Bank of Canada, which I presume
will be established by Dutch capital, is a
good thing. When the matter is before the
committee we should be given al details of
the operations of the proposed bank. Further,
if the sponsor can give us information about
the possibility of amending the Bank Act to
accommodate the backers of the proposed
bank, I for one should like to hear it.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
T qhn11 try tn qnwer the specific auestion.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Mr. Speaker, do I understand that the answer to this question will
close the debate?
The Hon. the Speaker: If it is only an
answer to a specific question addressed to
the mover of the bill, it would not close the
debate.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Perhaps it would be
simpler if the honourable leader opposite
said what he had to say now. He also may
have some questions to ask.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I have no desire to interrupt the answer to the question put by my
honourable friend from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert), but the Speaker warned the house
a few days ago about application of the
rule in this respect, and I did not want to
be taken by surprise by the closing of the
debate.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Perhaps I should hear
what the honourable leader opposite has to
say, and then attempt to answer all questions
when he is through.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I am for the most part in accord with the
views expressed by my honourable colleague
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) and the
honourable gentleman from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck).
One question in my mind is, what is the
purpose of the bank? Apparently it is not
going into the commercial field. It proposes
to open offices in Vancouver and Montreal,
both of which are centres for foreign trade.
I can understand that it may be a sort of
branch bank, but I am bothered by the possibility that when it is incorporated the door
will be opened, and there will be nothing to
prevent the 1,900 odd banks of the United
States coming to Canada and setting up
offices.
We must not forget that throughout the
depression years from 1929 to about 1939
Canada's banks survived while many of the
American banks failed. There is something
to be said for our banking system when it
can survive the fury of such a depression.
I have heard very little criticism of the
banks in my province since the depression,
although I did hear a good deal of criticism
before that. The main complaint was that
the banks would not lend enough money.
At the present time they are doing a great
deal of work for the federal government;
indeed they are almost a government agent
in many financial ventures. Any criticism
that I might make of the banks is that in
many instances they lend too much money,

which eventually results in the borrower's
failure. My memory goes back to the years
1927 to 1929, when large amounts of money
were lent on stocks, with the result that the
men and women who borrowed eventually
met financial ruin.
In 1951 the federal government used the
banks to control expenditures in this country.
I am not now arguing as to whether that was
right or wrong. The fact is that credits were
cut off and expenses were reduced through
the banks.
For my part, I am quite willing that this
bill go to committee for full consideration
though I fail to see the purpose of the measure.
When I heard that such a bill was coming to
this house I thought that the Amsterdam
group would be licensed here and would
bring their assets from that country. We must
not forget that Canada's reputation in world
banking circles is good. I am not an authority
on banks, but I know that when a bank is
given a charter to operate in Canada, it is
presumed to be a sound financial institution.
Why should this bank be incorporated here
without the full financial backing of the
organization behind it? Following the suggestion of my honourable friend from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), I ask, Why should
Canadian people put their money into this
venture with its limited capital stock? I
recall that back in 1932 the then Prime Minister of Canada told me that he had to be most
careful to keep the Canadian banking system
on an even keel. While he seemed to be able
to do it with ten or twelve banks, I am sure
he could not have done it with a hundred.
That is the trouble. If we let this Dutch bank
in, why should we not let in banks from every
state in the Union?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Well, why not let them
corne in?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Maybe it would be a good
thing. But rightly or wrongly I believe that
faith in Canadian banks was established when
at the height of the depression depositors
were able to go in and withdraw their
money, although many people in the United
States lost their entire savings.
My honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity
spoke about competition amongst banks. This
proposed institution would seem to me to
offer a rather peculiar kind of competition.
The whole matter should, in my opinion, be
carefully considered in committee. The question may well be asked: If banking operations
are profitable, why is it that bank stocks do
not rise and dividends are invariably low?
I do not know how many honourable senators
or members of the other place own bank
stocks; I doubt whether there are very many.

DECEMBER 8, 1952
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: There is the matter of
double liability.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes. The value of bank
stocks increases very slowly, and I believe
that at the present time the government takes
52 per 'cent of the 'profits of the banks.
Hon. Mr. Wood: With other taxes, 55 per
cent.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The Province of Manitoba
requires banks to put up $5,000 for the first
branch 'and $500 for -each succeeding branch.
These heavy taxes add to the risk of opening
branches. I know of little towns in Manitoba,
though I do not wish to name them, in which
the banks' operating expenses, plus the provincial tax of $500, has caused the branch
offices to be 'closed. I have no pecuniary
interest in the matter. I have not now nor
ever had a nickel invested in any bank in
the country.
Hon. Mr. Horner: You missed something
good.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Maybe I did, but anybody
who has owned bank stock advised me not
to buy it, and I took the advice. I may add
that I have always been able to borrow
money from a bank when I had a proposition
which was reasonable to nobody except myself. A proposition may have seemed attractive to me, but when I consulted someone
who had no interest in it one way or the
other, his reply was, "Haig, if I were a
banker I don't think I would make a loan to
you on that." My experience in this direction is, I venture to say, that of a good many
other business men in the house.
So I hope we shall go slowly about this
whole matter. We ought to be sure, when
we grant a charter to this or to any other
bank, that the capital of the mother bank is
behind the institution; and that requirement
should be written into the legislation. We
should make sure that there is security for
those involved and that we are not incorporating a fly-by-night organization.
I will not vote against the bill, but I
believe it should be very carefully considered
in committee.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, it
appears to me that there are some quite
unnecessary apprehensions of lurking dangers
behind this bill. In the first place, before
the promoters can do any business they must
secure a charter from parliament. If that is
obtained, they will be subject to all the provisions of the Bank Act and I would draw
attention to the fact that those provisions
which guarantee safety to depositors and to
holders of currency are vastly different from
what they were even twenty years ago. In
other words, through federal government inspection, and through the operations of the
68112-7

Bank of Canada, our Canadian banks now
are about as secure against failure as they
could be under any system which can be
devised. As the proposed bank will be subject to every provision of the Bank Act, I
cannot share the fears which have been expressed this evening as to this development.
Nor can I concur in the observation of my
honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck) to the effect that many people
think that Canadian banking today is a good
deal of monopoly. I do not believe it is.
There is very active competition, within the
framework of the Bank Act, between the
chartered banks. In my own experience of
banks, going back over quite a number of
years, I have had some evidence of that.
They were eager to get business. With that
purpose in view they gave the best possible
service; and today that service is of a very
high quality.
The honourable senator from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner) raised an important point
when he asked whether this bank, if it were
chartered, would be of any value to Canada.
It appears to me that it will have a very
definite value. Canada's position in the world
has changed greatly in the last ten years. A
glance at our trade statistics covering the
countries to which we export and from which
we import goods shows the immense ramifications of our trade. It is true that at the
present time the Far East, including Indonesia, China, Malaya and some adjacent lands,
is more or less in a state of ferment. Nevertheless, all of these countries are importers of
Canadian goods. The parent bank in the
Netherlands which is promoting this Mercantile Bank of Canada bas a vast experience in
the Far East. Canadian banks, whose operations abroad have been mainly in Central
and South America and the West Indies, have
neither the experience nor the connections in
eastern Asia.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Does my honourable
friend remember the Union Bank and the
Park Bank, its branch in China?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Which bank?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi:. Several years ago the
Union Bank of Canada established an export
branch in China called the Park Bank, and
it went broke.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That may be. The Union
Bank itself failed, or rather, it had to be
absorbed by another bank.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: The Park Bank was in
China.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: But that does not affect
the argument I am making, for the people
of the Netherlands have had decades and
decades of banking experience in the Far
East.

SENATE
How will this enterprise affect us? Probably the grentet rerent industrial develODment in Canada has been in British Columbia,
where an immense expansion of activity, the
fruit of large investments of capital, is evident in every direction. Where does the
market lie for the products of the Pacific
Coast? Very largely, I suggest, in the great
basin of the Pacific ocean. Malaya, Indonesia, the Philippines and other states in that
area are large importers of pulp and paper
and many other materials, raw and semifinished, which Canada can supply. So it
seems to me that the development of this
Mercantile Bank, associated as it will be with
the experience in the Far East of its promoters, cannot be otherwise than of great
advantage to this country.
There is not much danger that the Mercantile Bank of Canada, if granted a charter,
will be permited under our Canadian banking laws to develop along lines that may
imperil depositors in Canada or anywhere
else. Consequently, looking at the question
as a cold-blooded proposition, I quite heartily
support the second reading of the bill.
Hon. Salier A. Hayden: Honourable senators, I had not intended to say anything but
I am loath to agree to second reading of this
bill, which would mean approving of it in
principle, unless it is first understood that
I am not approving of the establishment of
more banks in Canada until I hear the full
story in committee.
It is not often that I find myself in disagreement with the honourable gentleman
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar). I am
afraid, however, that I cannot go as far as
he does when he suggests that the provisions
of the Bank Act guarantee a successful operation of banks in Canada. This is not so.
The Bank Act has its provisions and prerequisites for the setting up and the operation
of a bank. It provides for inspections and
returns, and in that way it goes as far as the
government feels it can go in safeguarding
the interests and funds of bank depositors.
But when the Bank Act stops there is still
required great wisdom, foresight, business
judgment and knowledge of industrial and
trade conditions in order that our Canadian
banks may operate successfully. The Bank
Act does not guarantee banks against losses.
Banking people have to apply their judgment
and risk their capital in order to make money
for the banks. They must exercise their best
judgment as to the manner in which, within
the limitations that are imposed upon them,
they should employ the money at hand.
I am neither for nor against this particular
bank, nor am I for or against the establishment of more banks at the present time. The

present drive that is going on for bank
depositors, as is evidenced by the opening
of bank branches throughout newly-developed
sections of the country, prove that there is
plenty of keen competition among existing
banks. There is certainly no such thing as a
cartel or a closed corporation so far as our
Canadian banks are concerned. From time
to time accounts move from one bank to
another, and I assume that people do a little
bit of shopping around and deposit their
money in the bank where they believe they
get the most favourable terms. That is the
best evidence of a free-enterprise system
with private capital operating at the greatest
advantage in the interests of those who use
the banks.
If this bank is incorporated by parliament
I do not know whether it is going to conduct
a banking business in all its phases or is just
going to engage in some of the banking
operations which may be more attractive and
remunerative. Is it going to leave to existing
institutions those phases of the banking business which form a drain upon the earnings
of banks? These are some of the questions
I should like to have answered in committee
before I vote for the passing of this bill by
parliament.
Hon. J. J. Kinley: Honourable senators, it
has always been my impression in this
country that as long as people can fulfil the
conditions of the Banking Act they are
entitled to go into the banking business. I
recall that when I was a member of the Banking Committee of the House of Commons the
Province of Alberta was refused a banking
permit, on the grounds that the province
wanted to set aside certain conditions of the
Bank Act, particularly with regard to a
deposit of $500,000. It was felt that even a
province should not be granted a banking
franchise unless it conforms to the provisions
of the Bank Act.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: May I ask the honourable senator a question?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Do I understand your
interpretation of the Bank Act to be this? If
I am prepared to meet the conditions of the
Act I am entitled to obtain a charter, and
therefore the function of parliament is simply
an automatic one of stamping the charter and
giving the incorporation?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: In principle, yes. I
maintain that the Bank Act was established
to protect the public and business generally,
and to ensure sound and stable commerce.
When people who want to incorporate a bank
are able to fill the conditions of the Act,

DECEMBER 8, 1952
parliament should go a long way before refusing them. After all, this is a bill for incorporation.
We are told that bankers do not make
much money. We know, however, that banking. is a stable business and that the banks in
Canada have been very successful. I remember well the time when the Province of Nova
Scotia was the seat of the banking business;
and there were a great many banks there.
But most of these banks were taken over by
central Canada with its greater monetary
resources. It was felt at that time that the
system of banking was being centralized, but
it would appear from experience that the
centralization of banks and the system of
agencies throughout this country was a wise
move. It provided an over-all strength to
every part of the country, and that is the
one difference between our banking system
and that of the United States.
I would remind honourable senators that
our banks have branches in foreign countries.
They are doing a good business, and that is
a test of their efficient operation.
It was said by the leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) that banks pay 52 per cent
of their profits to the government. I would
point out that this is true of every corporation in Canada which has a minimum earning
of over $10,000; and I think they are all glad
to pay.
The leader of the opposition expressed the
opinion that the assets of the Nationale Handelsbank in Amsterdam should be put behind
the Mercantile Bank of Canada, but I would
warn the house that this sort of thing works
both ways. If the assets of the bank in Amsterdam are included, by the same taken, so
are the liabilities. It may be that in Canada
we do not want to accept the responsibilities
and liabilities of a bank in Europe. I think
it would be better if it were purely Canadian
in its financial structure.
The Canadian banking system is about
the best in the world. For that reason it
should be able to meet fair competition. Our
banks are by no means sacred institutions.
The fact that a group of men obtain a charter
for the incorporation of a bank is no proof
that they are going to succeed in their
endeavours. The uncertainties of the future
apply to banking as to any other business. In
this field, as in all others, good management
succeeds and bad management fails. We
are told that over the years the percentage
of failures in commercial enterprises has been
very large. Well, I would suggest to the
house that our banks, notwithstanding their
great services and accumulated strength, are
not impregnable. We have had some bank
failures too in this country. Banks must
68112-7h

take their chances, as all other businesses
do, and I think they are happy to be allowed
to operate on this basis. I do not believe
we shall see any of the chartered banks
objecting to this proposed new bank, so
long as it is being brought into existence in
a proper way. On the other hand, if the
banks feel that there is anything improper
about what is proposed in this bill, I am
sure we shall hear from them.
I think we can safely proceed on the principle that any group of responsible men who
conform with the requirements of the Bank
Act should be allowed to go into the banking
business. For that reason, I am going to
vote for the second reading of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
may I have your indulgence for a moment,
so as to prevent any misunderstanding of
what I have said? In my experience I have
had nothing but courtesy and helpfulness
from the banks with which I have done
business; and I have a considerable respect
for the management of our banks, particularly for the local management.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Honourable senators,
may I be allowed to add a few words?
I intend to vote for the second reading
of the bill, but I think that in committee we should give it very careful
scrutiny and hear all the arguments about
it, pro and con. With all due respect for
my honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), with whose
proposition that competition is a good thing
I entirely agree, and admitting also that I
was much impressed by the arguments of
my honourable friend from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar), I still think it is well to point out
that our Canadian chartered banks provide
banking facilities throughout this country,
from east to west, not only in the larger
centres of Montreal, Vancouver, Toronto and
so on, where business is profitable, but in
thousands of small communities, where banking operations cannot be very profitable and
often must be unprofitable. That is one of
the things I think we should consider, and
we should protect the present banks, which
are carrying the load at this time. As has
been rightly said, they are affording this
country a sound banking system, which is
perhaps the envy of the world. I would be
the last to do anything that would in any
way, shape or form imperil our Canadian
banking system.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I think that one thing which can be said at
once is that, if they have done nothing else,
the few words I spoke when sponsoring this
measure for second reading have given rise
to a most interesting discussion. When one

introduces a private bill, in which he has no

the purpose of submitting it for consideration
in the house and thereafter in committee, I
do not know that it is his function to attempt
to ýanswer in full detail all the arguments
that have been raised in debate.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I fully agree that this
is an important matter and that it will be
necessary for us to consider the bill very
carefully when it goes to committee. On the
other hand, I do suggest to the house that
there is sufficient reason to give the bill second
reading, in order that we may conduct in
committee that inquiry which it is obviously
impossible for us to conduct here.
There were one or two questions asked to
which I can give answer. I can say to my
honourable friend from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert) that I know of no reason why the
introduction of this bill should lead to any
amendment of the Bank Act. In fact, a look
at the bill suggests that precisely the reverse
is the case. This bill seeks to bring the proposed new bank squarely and fairly within
the four corners of the existing Bank Act.
My honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) asked whether the proposed new bank contemplated engaging in
domestic or local business. Well, that is an
extremely difficult question to answer. I
thought I made it plain that at the outset
the primary object was to engage in international business, particularly with the Far
East. But, of course, having been granted a
charter under the Bank Act, this bank would
be in a position to engage in domestic banking business, if, as and when it appeared to
it to be profitable or advisable to do so.
There is one precedent for the sort of
thing that is being asked for in this bill,
and that is the incorporation of Barclays
Bank (Canada), which obtained a charter
from the parliament of this country some
twenty-five or thirty years ago, I think. That
too was a subsidiary of a large European
bank-in that case a British bank-and that
too was organized primarily for the purpose
of engaging in international trade between
Canada and Great Britain and the various
parts of the Commonwealth in which Barclays Bank, the parent organization, is so
strongly established. When Barclays Bank
(Canada) began operations it had, I think,
only one office, in Montreal. Over the years
it has greatly extended its business in
Canada, and it now has a branch office in
Montreal, as well as one each in Toronto and
Vancouver. I am not sure whether it bas

one

in Winnipeg, but at any rate it is

grnrii1ilvy nvtpnrlir

itsfanadian business as

conditions permit.
It is impossible for me to gauge what the
future may bring to the new bank which
this bill proposes to incorporate. The only
general answer I can give to my honourable
friend is that the .power to engage in a
general banking business in Canada will be
there, if parliament sees fit to grant a charter.
What was said by my honourable friend
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) about the
very stringent control now exercised by the
government of this country over every
chartered bank, has, I think, a good 'deal of
force. It is true, as was pointed out by the
honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden) that the government cannot guarantee that every loan which is made by a
bank will be a good loan. But it will be
recalled that in the year 1934 the Bank Act
was amended to provide for the appointment
of a federal official called the Inspector
General of Banks, who has very extensive
and continuous duties in examining into the
conditions of the chartered banks. I think
I am right ini saying that at no time since
that amendment was introduced has there
been any failure of a Canadian chartered
bank, or even a suspicion that any of them
were anywhere near to being unable to fulfil
their obligations.
Honourable senators, I believe that is about
all I can usefully say. If it is the wish of
the house to obtain most complete details in
committee, I am quite sure that the sponsors
of the measure will be willing and indeed
anxious to provide the information.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I should like to make a brief statement with
respect to the forthcoming adjournment,
about which a number of honourable members have asked me for information. The
question presents some problems, but I will
give the house what I think about it under
the existing circumstances. As always, I
must reserve the right to change my views
should unforeseen circumstances develop.
There is some doubt as to whether we will
be able to complete our consideration of the
legislation presently before us by Thursday,
December 18, and if on that date the work
has not been completed, I will then move
that we adjourn until January 12, when we
can complete our consideration of outstanding matters and adjourn until Tuesday, February 3. It is highly un.likely that any appreciable amount of new legislation will reach
us from the House of Commons before that
date. On the other hand, should it develop
that the present legislation is disposed of on
or before December 18, I would consider that
no useful purpose would be served, by our
re-assembling on January 12, and accordingly
would move that we adjourn until February 3.
The basis of my proposal is that when we
have work to do we should do it with all
reasonable expedition, but that when we have
nothing to do we should adjourn.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, I have
listened with interest to what the honourable
leader has had to say, and have one observation to make. It is rather awkward for
those of us who come from as far away as
British Columbia to return to Ottawa on
January 12 for a period of perhaps three or
four days, and then adjourn until an early
date in February. I think such an arrangement would hardly be fair to those of us who
have so far to travel.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I have stated my
proposal.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Can the honourable leader
of the government give the house any idea
of the prospects of adjourning on December
18 for the longer period?
While I am on my feet I might add that
if we re-assemble on January 12 we may be
here for only a few days before adjourning
until February. That means that those of

SENATE
us who choose to spend Christmas at home
will be coming back here for a few days
only, and then either staying arounci Ottawa
with nothing to do or returning home at our
own expense. That, honourable senators, is
a consideration. If the honourable leader is
able to give us any enlighteniment on the
prospect, I for one should. like to hear it.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I think the only enlightenment I can give is
that as the sole member of the government
in this house it is my duty to present legislation in the Senate and to see that it gets
early and careful consideration. The length
of time the Senate chooses to spend on legislation, either in the bouse or before the committees, is entirely up to honourable senators.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I ask a further
question? Is the longer adjournment dependent upon the passage of the Criminal Code
Bill through this house?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes; by reason of its
size it, along with other legislation, has some
bearing.
I may say that I should net like what I
have said to be taken as an indication of any
particular wishes on my part, for I live in
Ottawa and am impartial; however, I do
appreciate what has been said by honourable
senators who have some distance te travel.
I would net suggest that the discussion of
proposed legislation should not occupy all the
time which the Senate m'ay see fit to give
it. However, it seems to -me, although it is
for the house to decide, that matters might
be se far expedited as to avoid the possibility
that on the 18th of December our consideratien of this legislation would not be
completed.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday, the
consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening of the session, and the motion of Honourable Mr.
Vaillancourt for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators, I
realize that most if not all of the items contained in the Speech from the Throne will
come before us from time to time, and that
opportunity will then be available to speak
on them, so that it is not my intention to
deal with many of them this afternoon.
My first words are to commend the government for the appointment of the Hon. Mr.
Mayhew as Canada's Ambassador to Japan.
Those of us who live in British Columbia, in
common no doubt with many elsewhere, know

will arise when matters of trade between that
country and our own come under discussion.
Excluding countries within the British Commonwealth, Japan now holds second place
in respect of our exports, the United States
leading, with Venezuela third. In the first
nine months of this year our sales to Japan
have risen to nearly $69 million. If business
is maintained at this rate, by the end of the
year nearly $90 million worth of Canadian
goods will have gone to Japan for the use
and benefit of the people of that country.
But our imports from Japan have been of
the order of only eight or nine million dollars,
and I noticed in the press the other day that
the Japanese Ambassador spoke seriously
about this disparity in trading, asked for
western investment in Japan, and appealed
for greater opportunities for the sale of
Japanese goods in western markets. To those
who live in the central provinces I would
say, do not be obstructive in this matter or
allow pressure groups in Canada to stop
Japanese goods from coming in, or Japan
may perforce turn to the Soviet, and we shail
be deprived of a bulwark in the Pacific,
represented by a nation of 95 million people,
whose aid we greatly need in the Far East.
Regarding the recognition which the government has given British Columbia by the
appointment of two cabinet ministers from
that province, I was interested in some historical references by the honourable leader
of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) to the early
days of the Canadian Pacific Railway. In
looking through my papers the other day I
came upon some information which illustrates
afresh how foolish sometimes it is for people
to assume the role of prophets. When, in
1881 the C.P.R., disappointed in efforts to
raise money in Canada, went to London with
a view to selling bonds for the construction
of its road into British Columbia, London
"Truth" had this to say about that province:

But the writer did not overlook Manitoba:
Here is his comment on that province:
A friend of mine told me,-and he knew what he
was talking about,-that he did not believe the
much touted Manitoba settlement would hold out
many years. The people who have gone there
cannot stand the coldness of the winters. Men
and cattle are frozen to death In numbers that
would startle the intending settler if he knew, and
those who are not killed outright are often maimed
for life by frostbites. Its street nuisances kill people
with malaria or drive them mad with plagues of
Insects; and to keep themselves alive during the
long winters they have to imitate the habits of
the Esquimaux. Those who want to know what it
is like should read the not-yet forgotten books of
Colonel Butler. His "Great Lone Land" is the land
of which the Canadian Pacific Railway has yet fiveand-twenty million acres to sell, and it is through a
death-dealing region of this kind that the "new
railway" la to run.

When one realizes what wonderful provinces
now lie from Manitoba westward to British
Columbia, it is interesting to look back on
that prophecy after all these years and smile.
I sympathize with the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) in his views about the
United Nations. I, too, am not so confident
in this matter. If one reads the history of
1898, some fifty-four years ago, one will find
that Czar Nicholas II spoke in exactly the
same language as is being used today by
Stalin's advocates at the United Nations.
Back in 1898 the Czar talked about maintaining peace and carrying out a program of disarmament. No one would dare argue that
we should cease talking about this merely
because of the fact that for fifty-four years
now Russia, in particular, has been talking
of peace and disarmament. Those who come
from Russia do not like to be reminded of
this fact. They want to tell you that they
belong to the Soviet Republic. Just the same,
it should be pointed out that the Russian is
still there and he has not altered his ways or
his old ambitions.

have built a permanent building to fight in."
I do flot think that staternent is far frorn the
truth. Wilson Woocisicie has said in a receni
article that the "have-nots" of the United
Nations have the votes, and the latest proposai arnongst the "have-not" nations is to
arnalgarnate and forrn a union to get more
and better deals frorn the countries who
"have". One of these "have" countries is
Canada, which in my opinion is exceedingly
well off. I would point out, however, that
many of us are beginning to fear what rnay
happen if we lose our export markets. I trust
that we are not going to price ourselves out
of sorne of our export markets. Let me illustrate by just one instance which to my way
of thinking is alarrning. Last year the hierring industry in British Columbia was worth
$81 million. This year some of the leaders of
the fisheries union-perhaps Soviet inspired
-called a strike, and as a resuit no herring
will be caught this year.
Further, the
st.rikers have pubiished articles in the press
about the starvation wages paid by the fish
canning companies. The house will be interested to learn that last year every man aboard
the herring vessels-I ar n ot talking about
the captains, but the deckhands-earned
$3,500 for approximately seventy days' work.
With the price of fish oul dropping from about
eighteen cents to about six cents, the fishermen were offered a eut in the per ton prices
for herring. The strikers called these starvation prices, but I arn informed that had they
accepted the terms offered every man aboard
a herring vessel would have earned at least
$2,250 for seventy days' employment. Is it
any wonder that some of us are becoming
alarmed at this trend? I saw an editorial
the other day about British Columbia carpenters, who went on strike this year. They
were dernanding $2.50 an hour. The carpenters were being commended in the editorial
on the fact that they had decided not to
proceed at the present tirne with a demand
for a thirty-hour week.
As I say, I do not know where we are
going in this country. I really hope that we
can maintain our way of life and continue
to be able to pay these great prices for the
services of our citizens. But I think the
time has corne to draw the serious attention
of the union leaders and the people at large
to the way we are drifting.
There have been other strikes in the fishing industry with regard to certain species
of sairnon. As there are no export markets
for our salmon and British Columbia warebouses are filled with salmon fromn last year's
fishing as weli as ýthis, our fishermen were
toid that they would have to take a minor
wage cut this year. They said "No." And so

it goes. Wages are increasing and working

When we demand more, governments tnevitabiy
grow bigger and so do our taxes. And governments
can't do and spend more and tax less. Big government means more interference in our everyday
lives. and a strengthening of the faiiacy that big
government by its nature is good and desirabie.
Some of the most outspoken opponents of big
government and big public expenditures are very
prone to say their pleas to Ottawa are just--

I emphasize these words, that they think
their own particular pleas are just. The
writer continues:
-it's the other feliows with their pleas who are
making improper dlaims which contribute to big
government.

And they contribute also to high taxes.
And now we see that many members of
parliament, on the governrnent side, are
beginning to importune the government to go
ahead with a great national heaith insurance
scheme for Canada. Before I comment upon
that, I wish to make a few preliminary
rernarks.
We muust and should remember
that there is no socialism without centrahization, and a national health seheme would be,
in part at ieast, socialistic. As a governiment
grows in size it grows in authority, because
more and more power is concentrated in the
hands of a few.

DECEMBER 9, 1952
Canada's system of government, so far as
my reading of history shows, was designed to
distribute power and to act as a check upon
the dangerous cen#tralization that is the
essential basis of socialism. I wonder if those
who are advocating centralization-whether
they cali themselves Liberals or not-realize
that they are in effect striking at the British
North Arnerica Act, which sought to spread
governrnental powers eveniy between the
dominion and the provinces. I hear members
of parliarnent; and others urging that the
federal government do ail kinds of things
that it was not intended to do-build roads,
build hospitals, build almost anything at ail.
To my way of thinking, that kind of thing
would lead us down a certain path that cauid
only end in state dictatorship. We give lip
service to the British North America Act and
to the rights of the provinces, but subtly and
surely these provincial rights are gradually
being filched away. Woodrow Wilson well
said some forty years ago:
The history of liberty is a history of limitations
of governmental power, not of the increase of it.

Let us remember that communism is mereiy
the clirnax of despotic government power;
and whether we agree with communisrn or
not, the fact is that as our governments
become greater and greater we graduaiiy take
on the face of our enemy.
I corne now to this proposai before the
country for heaith insurance. So far as I
know, no one has yet defined what he means
by health insurance or stated. ciearly what it
wouid consist of. I once heard the late
Prime Minister Mackenzie King say ta a
gx'oup of Liberais, "lYou can neyer outbid the
C.C.F." Yet, that is what some Liberals are
now trying to do. A national health scheme
is being proposed in another place by a certain party, and with an election in sight some
who want to be eiected think this might be a
very good talking point, and so are expressing
themselves in f avour of the proposai. It is
feared by some others that if they criticize
the proposai. at ail or -corne out against it,
the voters wi'll reject them at the next
election.
Well, there is a great danger of jumping
into a thing of that kind too quickly, as we
found. out in British Columubia. We have a
rather sad story to tell about hospitalization.
The present scheme that we have out there
had its origmn in this way. Some years ago
it was suggested andl talked about, not; very
warrnly, shall I say, ai over the province,
and with the view of outsmarting the C.C.F.,
the Liberai governrnent in the province
jumped into the scheme without giving any
great thought to the possible costs. Before
coming down here I collected some figures,
68112-8à

so as to be able to tell you where we are
drifting to in British Columbia. As no doubt
m-ost honourabie members know, the scheme
is cornpuisory. In 1949, when it was first put
into effect, the premiurn for a single man was
$15, and for a married man with one chiid
$24. Well, as soon as the hospitals iearned
that the government was underwriting the
costs, and that people were compeled to pay
these premiums, the operating costs of hospitais went up. Union organizers waiked in
and organized ail the nurses, ail the janitors
and everybody else around the hospitals who
could be organized. 0f course, the doctors
already had a union of their own, Sa the
unions couid not get any further with thern.
To give the house an idea of the degree to
which hospitai staffs have been unlonized, I
will repeat a story that was toid me by a
doctor in Vancouver just befare I carne ta
Ottawa. He said that when attending a
patient at the Vancouver Generai Hospital
he needed to use an oxygen tent, but the door
of the patient's roozu was too, srnaii to admit
So he asked the janitar,
the apparatus.
"Would you mind taking a screw-driver and
removing the door f rom its hinges, so that I
can get this machine inside?" The janitor
replied: "Do not expect me to do that. If I
did a thing of that kind I wouid be up before
the union." The doctor himseif then barrowed a screw-driver from the janitor and
removed the door frorn its hinges.
If an eiectric lamp breaks or burns out, do
not think that any one of the attendants there
would put in a new one. It too is a speciaized
job, and if one of thema were asked to do it
he would, say "That is flot my job, and if I
did it the union would get after me."
Naturaiiy costs kept on clirnbing, and it
was not long before the provincial government found that the original scale of prerniums was not large enough. In 1950 the rates
were increased to, $21 for a single man and
$33 for a rnarried rnan with one child. But
there were stiil rnore dernands for increased
wages, and other costs as weil continued to
rise, s0 th-at the hospitais were stili experiencing financial difficuities. Then in 1951 the
government put the premiums up again, this
time to $30 for a single man and $42 for a
married man, with one child.
On the lst of July, 1951, a acherne of socalled co-insurance was introduced. It was
said that many people were staying in hospital much longer than was necessary, and
the governrnent decided that sarne method
wouid have to, be adopted ta make these
people go horne when they were well enough
to do so. Sa this co-insurance scherne provided that in addition to the annual prernium
there should be a charge of frorn $2 ta $3.50

SENATE
per day during the first ten days that a
person spent in hospital. That is, a married
person who had paid an annual premium of
$42 and was in hospital ten days would
pay an additional charge of $20 or more.
These additional charges caused great dissatisfaction, and many people were hopeful
that the government would cail an election
before long, so that they could register their
definite protest. Well, an election was held
and the people did register a protest, and in
no uncertain ternis. And so the Social Credit
party came into office. It had made some
kind of promise to eliminate the compulsory
feature of the insurance and allow people to
pay or flot, as they liked. In July of this
year the new government, as a gesture to the
people, reduced the annual premiums for
both single and married persons by $3 a
year; that is, it made the premium for a
single person $27 and for a married man
with one cbild $39. Also, the co-insurance
charge was reduced to $1 per day, but it is
to be paid as long as the patient remains
in hospital. Thus, if a patient is hospitalized
for fifteen days he wilI pay $15; but if he
has to stay in the institution for fifty days
he will pay $50, and so on. This, as I say,
is in addition to the annual premium; and
now the newly elected government is finding
itself in difficulties.
So the 'matter now
stands. Certain hospital authorities in the
province have recently told the governiment
that tbey are not going to carry on any
longer. Thiey say "You can have the hospital,
and do what you like with it".
I have mentioned these facts just to show
the kind of thing that can happen when a
government scheme of this kind is adopted
hastily. The experience of the gove'rnment
of British Columbia was somewhat similar to
that of the British government after it began
to supply free glasses, free teeth, and free
medical services of every kind. Everybody
wanted to take advantage of these things thaît
were free.
People were changing their
glasses every week because they did not like
the colour of the rims. That kind of thing
has been happening, until today Great Britain
is labouring under a systemn whicb, if the
truth were told, she really cannot afford.
The major difficulty in the way of the
success of the health scheme attempted in
British Columbia was that it could not be
made compulsory.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It simply could not be done,
and the government was afraid to face up
to the need for -compulsion. True, the odd
person bere and there was checked-and I
feit sorry for these few-especially when it
became apparent that at least thirty-five per
cent of the people of the province were nýot

paying anything towards hospitalization; nor
are thýey yet paying; and it is my opinion
that no scheme carrieci by only sixty or sixtyfive per cent of the people can succeed.
That is the problem facing British Columbia. In my opinion that province will neyer
succeed in operating a healtb scheme unless
it is paid for directly from the exchequer or
by means of a sales tax imposed for the
specific purpose.
As honourable senators
know, a sales tax is not a very popular collection method. I think the federal government was alert in its financing of the universal
old age pension by taking two per cent of
the sales tax and directing it to that purpose.
The general public neyer felt it as there was
no added burden in so far as the sales tax
was concernied.
When talking of the welfare state, I am one
who believes that the action of the present
government during the past few years has
pushed the C.C.F. party off the map. That
was the party that frightened some people
into an advocacy of a welfare state. Notwithstanding that, we are today giving more
and more consideration to a national health
policy. What does this mean? Does it mean
that our bospitalization will be taken care
of, that we will have free teeth care, or what?
The people of this country must be warned
that whatever they get from this or any
other government must be paid for. There
is no hidden barrel into which the government
can dîp to pay for all these services; therefore some guidance and some warning about
the costs of the welfare state should now be
given to the people.
Another trend wbich I view with alarm is
the dlaim that pensionabllity at seventy years
is too late, and that people should become
pensionable at sixty-five. I warn the country
and the government to guard agaînst any
such campaign. I recently read with interest
an article entitled: "A Doctor Looks at Retirement." In this article the doctor warns about
what can happen when you retire at sixtyfive. These are bis words:
Bankers, teachers, saIaried scientists and others
in the higher employed groups are forcibly relieved
of their positions at 60. Unions, too, do flot realize
that when they ask for and get retirement pensions
at 60 or 65, they are in many cases signing a death
certificate for a working man who has been used to
a daily routine of employment ail his life. When
he is shifted from the factory machine to the
armohair he
soon
deteriorates
mentally and
physicaily.

I realize of course, that some provision
bas to be made for the earlier retirement
of persons wbo are not in good bealth. 1
tbink, bowever, the members of the medical
profession should warn people of the dangers
of early retirement. The insurance companies
have long known that men who retired from

DECEMBER 9, 1952
their labours as active railway workers, for
instance, had in three years' time become
bent, crippled and almost ready for the
grave, because they had nothing to do. It
is interesting to note that some of the leaders
of the various labour unions who previously
favoured retirement at sixty-five are themselves seventy years of age or over. Mr.
Mosher, in an article entitled "Should Retirement at Sixty-five be Compulsory?" admits
that his views in earlier years were wrong.
Now that he bas reached seventy, he is in
disagreement with the policy of retirement
at sixty-five.
May I say one further word as to Great
Britain's welfare state, and I direct my
remarks to those honourable senators who
belong to the medical profession. According
to the reports I get from the Old Country, the
good health of many of the citizens there bas
been acquired since the beginning of World
War II. This was due not so much to the
welfare state as to the fact that the people
had been on rations and could not get all
they wanted to eat. It should teach a lesson
to the people in this country, many of whom
are eating themselves into the grave, with
no one to warn them of the dangers they
are incurring. I was about to combine overdrinking with over-eating, but perhaps I
should stick to eating, because I know more
about itHon. Mr. Hugessen: Question?
Hon. Mr. Reid: -and am one of those who
watch their diet carefully, and eat very
little.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: An authority?
Hon. Mr. Reid: A scientist, prominent
enough to address the Mayo Brothers Clinic,
lived with me last year for a period of three
weeks. He made this observation: "Where
I come from I have never known people to
drop dead with heart disease; True, you may
be able to hear them breathing heavily when
climbing a mountain, but they never die or
drop dead suddenly of heart attack". He
went on to say that what in his opinion
was wrong with the people of this country
was that they ate too much. Human beings
should not be led to hope or believe that
they will be better off under a cradle-to-thegrave welfare policy. The welfare state is
not the complete answer.
I do not want anyone to point a finger at
me and accuse me of being opposed to social
services, for I am not. I consider it my duty,
however, to speak today in answer to certain
welfare proposals that have been made, and
to meet the agitations of certain people. In
my opinion this country is not nearly ready
for a national health scheme. Such a scheme

does make good propaganda, and may well be
a lure to many; but if I were a member of
the government I would be cautious and take
warning from the experiences of other countries which have embarked on all-embracing
schemes of this kind.
I turn now for a few minutes to a subject
which, to my knowledge, has not been discussed in parliament, but which is of such
tremendous importance to the health and welfare of the country that I think the attention
of government and the people should be
drawn to it. I refer to the use of narcotics
and drugs, a problem which is becoming
acute on the Pacific coast. I believe it has
also become more or less acute in Montreal
and Toronto, and perhaps in Winnipeg but in
British Columbia it is of very serious concern
to the authorities.
First of all, I should like to refer to some
information which has been submitted by the
Standing Committee on the Prevention of
Narcotic Addiction, which was set up in
Vancouver to bring the problem to the attention of the people of Canada and to the government. The committee, under the chairmanship of Dr. Lawrence E. Banta, published
an article entitled "Drug Addiction in Canada
-The Problem and Its Solution". Honourable
senators, upon first hearing the solution suggested by this article you may be inclined
to disagree with it; but I ask that you hear
it and give it some thought before coming to
a final conclusion. This committee, organized
on a voluntary basis, is doing much to bring
the drug traffic to the attention of not only
the people of Vancouver but the government.
The article, in its reference to drugs, has
this to say:
A variety of narcotie drugs may be extracted
from plants . . . The most dangerous drugs are
chemically refined from raw plant narcotic chemicals, or they are completely synthesized from
entirely innocent organic chemical sources.
Morphine is the principal active agent of opium.
It is one of the most valuable drugs employed by
medical science, but it readily causes addiction. It
may be employed as extracted from opium or it
may be chemically modified into diacetyl-morphine
(heroin).
The latter drug is reputed to cause
habituation with comparative quickness.
Coca leaf yields cocaine (snow) which may produce a relatively less tenacious addiction, but it has
drastic physical and mental effects.
The active agent of Indian hemp is not used in a
refined state. The leaves of the plant are smoked.
Habituation to marihuana is perhaps less destructive to the individual, but it frequently leads to the
employment of more sinister drugs. Its victims may
also produce crimes of particular violence.
There are a number of fully synthesized narcotic
drugs, e.g., demorol, which may induce habituation
with results equally destructive as addiction ta
natural drugs . . .
It is not possible to obtain a satisfactory estimate
of the number of drug addicts in Canada, or in any
part of it. There is, however, a fairly adequate

SENATE
knowledge ai the number of addicts who are at
present free to continue their addiction, but who
were at one time convicted on a dug c±elg.
These number some 4800 persons in Canada, of
whom at least 1300 persons are in Vancouver. Thus,
about a quarter of Canada's known drug addicts
live in this city.

Bear in mind that these figures only relate
to the number of those who have come before
our police courts. They do not include the
many who are addicted to the drug habit but
who, living in homes private or elsewhere,
are not generally known to the police.
Unhappily, there is no evidence that the present
system of control of narcotic addiction is succeeding in reducing the number of addicts. In fact, all
signs point to a progressive increase, as illustrated
by the number of prosecutions under the Opium
and Narcotic Drug Act in Vancouver during recent
years.
In 1947 there were 120 prosecutions; in 1948, 168;
in 1949, 195; in 1950, 260; and in 1951, 266; while the
first six months of 1912 have seen 169 prosecutions.
This may reflect a growing efficiency of the lawenforcement agencies, but it may reveal greater
opportunities for discovery.

I am not going to unduly weary honourable senators by reading all this material,
because I do not think it is necessary to do
so, but one statement that I should like to
put on record is that of Honourable Mr.
Justice Manson, when he recently sentenced
ten persons who had been convicted because
they had drugs in their possession and were
engaged, or about to be engaged, in the traffic
in drugs. He said:
Years ago it was said by a very eminent judge, a
former colleague of mine, the late Mr. Justice
Murphy, that a man who trafficked in drugs was
worse than a murderer in that he murdered not
only the body but the soul. The drug addict is,
indeed, a tragic person. He has ceased to be master
of himself. He sinks and sinks to the very lowest
depths of moral depravity, and when the addict is
a woman-a girl of teen age-the situation is twice
as tragic.
No crime can be more heinous than that of the
individual who peddles drugs. It is twice heinousutterly damnable-when the pedlar peddles to girls;
that peddling results in the prostitution of both
body and soul. It is no excuse to say the girls
were bad or they "asked me for drugs".

Finally, Judge Manson says:
It is not for me to enquire why girls go wrong,
nor to pass judgment upon those who have been
responsible for their upbringing.
One can only
believe that someone has been criminally neglectful in the upbringing of these girls.

The association makes certain suggestions
which have aroused considerable criticism.
First, they point out that the great spread of
drug addiction is due to the increase in the
traffic which is the consequence of the fabulous profits which are made by the selling of
drugs. Unfortunately it is not always possible
to get hold of the higher-ups. Usually the
police catch a man or woman who has some
drugs in his or her possession, and who,
maybe, is peddling to others.

According to the committee's report, it
costs an habitual addict $7,000 a year to buy
the "shots" necessary to keep him going.
You can realize just what has to be done
by these drug addicts at certain times to
obtain the money necessary to secure the
drug they desire. Usually, I am told, the
pri.ce begins at about $6 a "shot". Before
long the young girl or boy who becomes
addicted needs two or three "shots" a day,
with the result that the boy often takes to
stealing and the young girl goes off and
stays with someone who can provide her
with funds.
The committee also point out-and honourable senators who are doctors may disagree, if I do not correctly state the factsthat for those who begin to take heroin there
is no certain cure but death itself. Once
they start on that road, they are gone. Those
who peddle this stuff nay attend dances, or
even go around the schools to induce these
youngsters to try a "shot". It feels so good,
they say, that after a while they want
another; and when they have acquired the
appetite, ways and means must be found to
get the necessary money for more.
The committee, having given considerable
thought and study to the subject, believe that
our whole approach to the matter will have
to be revolutionized. They are not unmindful of the splendid work done by the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police in apprehending
offenders, but catching them, bringing them
before a judge and having them sentenced to
jail is no cure at all. As a matter of fact,
instead of convictions improving, they are
getting worse, and many serious--minded citizens are really alarmed. The situation has
aroused some criticism from an ex-member
of the police who held a very prominent
position in the force, and has recently written
an article on the proposals of the committee.
Former Superintendent R. S. Wilson does not
disagree with the proposals in their entirety,
but in only one particular. He does not
think that la panel of doctors should be set
up through whom drug addicts should obtain
their dose at a nominal price, say 25 cents or
so, under medical supervision and control.
But others believe that, while it would not
effect the cure of those who take drugs, it
might eliminate a traffic which means hundreds of thousands of dollars to those who
are in the business.
I know people who take the viewpoint that
the trafficker who, though not using the drug
himself, takes money for the sale of it, should
be given the death sentence. Whether or not
we agree with the contention that this should
be done, we must all agree that this traffic is
one of the most serious problems affecting
the welfare of our youth to-day. As I have

DECEMBER 9, 1952
said, it is affecting the youth of Vancouver
and other cities like Montreal and Toronto,
and perhaps Winnipeg and Halifax.
Mr. Wilson, the former R.C.M.P. Superintendent, is quoted in the Vancouver Province
as follows:
Where, before the war Canadian addicts used
opium and morphine, they are now almost 100 per
cent addicted to heroin, a drug so deadly in its
habit-forming characteristics that its medical use
is forbidden throughout the United States and in
ail hospitals in this country operated by the
Department of Veterans Affairs.

He says further-and in this he is in agreement with the committee's proposal:
-that the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act should be
amended to provide that a drug addict, after certification as such by three physicians, must be committed for a period of not less than 10 years to a
narcotic hospital operated by the Federal Government.

The committee in charge of this report on
narcotic addiction agree that these people
who are addicted should be treated medically
instead of criminally. They clain that wherever this has been tried it has been the means
of reducing the number of drug victims. In
1937 the number of addicts reported in Great
Britain was about 700. In 1949 Great Britain
had 326 addicts in addition to 337 who regularly received drugs. In this country we have
4,800 known drug addicts in a population of
some 14 million people.
The Deputy Chief of Police of Vancouver
told me recently that most of the teen-agers,
who are arrested in that city for theft and
burglary are drug addicts, and that their ages
range from fourteen to nineteen. He said that
these addicts resorted to crime when they

could not get enough money to pay for the
dope they crave.
I am not going into this subject to-day as
exhaustively as I could, but I do want to bring
the matter before the Senate in the hope that
serious notice will be taken of the terrible
traffic in drugs, and that parents will endeavour to find out what their sons and daughters
are doing, so that they can guide them and
prevent them from going down the narcotic
path. I hope that the government will give
consideration to the recommendations that
have been put forth, particularly the one
advocating that the federal government coopperate with the provincial authorities in
setting up a pilot treatment and rehabilitation centre. This probably could be established somewhere in the centre of British
Columbia. Surely the federal government
could not readily refuse to co-operate with
the provincial authorities in the establishment of this kind of clinic, with a view to
trying to eliminate this serious drug traffic.
To my mind it is worth a trial. It is believed
that this centre, would develop into a medical
rehabilitation centre to serve as a substitute
for the present ineffective penitentiary confinement of addicts who have committed no
crime other than to become addicted to a
narcotic drug.

DECEMBER 10, 1952
Indians, and persons of mixed blood, commonly referred to as Metis, of whom the
great majority were French Metis and spoke
French. Many were Scotch and English
Metis and spoke English.
Up to this time the residents had relied
largely on the flesh of the buffalo and other
wild animais for food, and on their hides
for clothing and shelter. But by the late
1860's wild life in this area had become
scarce, and it became necessary for them
to look to some extent to agriculture for a
living. Consequently, they purchased lands
from the Hudson's Bay Company and were
given titie to what were known as "river
lots". A river lot had a narrow frontage
on a river, and extended back for a considerable distance, so that each lot owner
had access to the river and to trails without crossing the property of others. The
residents became active in building homes
for themselves, in tilling the soil on their
river lots and in building churches and
schools. They were happy and prosperous
according to their mode of living.
As I have already stated, the terrîtory
was then a colony of Great Britain, separate
and apart from Canada. Although Canada
was negotiating with Britain for the purchase, she had no greater rights in this territory than ini New York State prior to July
15, 1870. Yet, without any rîghts there,
Canada undertook to usurp the rights of
the residents in the Red River -area. The
natives resisted, claiming the rights and
privileges to which they were entitled as
subjects of Great Britain. But the Canadian
government crossed the Indians and Metis
at every turn, and treated them with scorn
and contempt as an inferior race.
Let me here recaîl some of the ways in
which the Canadian government persecuted
the Indians. I think I should do so in detail
to show how the morale of the Indians, who
were a proud and haughty people by nature,
was destroyed.
Some two years before Canada had
acquired any rights in the Northwest Territories, Col. J. S. Dennis, an official of the
Canadian government, entered the Red River
settlement with a crew of surveyors and
equipment, to make a survey of the country and prepare it for settlement. Dennis,
with his crew and equipment, entered upon
the river lots of the natives to survey themh
according to a checker-board plan. The surveyors refused to recognize the titles to the
lands issued by the Hudson's Bay Company
to the Indians and Metis. This stirred up
much restless excitement among the natives.

At that tîme William McTavish was the
local Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company. The Government of Canada, without
any right to do so, as the country was still
owned by the company as a Colony of Great
Britain, dismissed him as governor of the
country, and appointed William McDougall,
erstwhile Minister of Public Works, as Lieutenant Governor, purporting to give him
dictatorial powers over the area. The Hudson's Bay Company officiais in London protested against this encroachment on their
rights, and McTavish abdicated his office
-as governor of the territory.
The abdication by Governor McTavish
lef t the territory without any government.
Matters went well for a while, but disturbances taking place, the people thought it
advisable to set up a government of their
own, whieh was organized by Thomas
Spence. No other end was sought in this
organization than mutual protection. As soon
as the Imperial Government was made aware
of what the people had done, it notifled Mr.
Spence how far he could go without breaking
the law. (John M'acoun's Manitoba and the
Northwest Territories p. 457.)
The provisional government was fully recognized by
Governor McTavish (p. 464.)
In December 1869 Donald A. Smith
appeared as Governor of the Hudson Bay
Company to succeed McTavish, but not as
governor of the settlement. He, too, acknowledged the provisional government created by
the residents and gave a pledge that he
would take no step to upset it. (W. M.
Davidson's Lif e and Times of Louis Riel,
p. 31.)
McDougall who was appointed Governor by
Canada, armed Surveyor Dennis with a proclamation purporting to have been issued by
the Queen, transferring the Northwest Territories to Canada. It was a forgery. Yet, on
the strength of it, McDougall appointed Surveyor Dennis "Conservator of the Peace",
with authority to:
-raise,
disarm,
mnto..

organize, arm, equip,
. . attack. arrest,
assault, fire upon, pull down, or break

Dennis raised an armed force of some 45 or
50 men to overthrow the provisional government. They were quickly surrounded, disarmed, and imprisoned in Fort Garry. As
neither the Government of Canada nor
McDougall had any rights in the Northwest
Territories at that time, they could not confer
any on Dennis. Their actions stirred up great
hostility among the natives towaýrds Canada.
As a result of the election in February
1870, forty persons-twenty French speaking
and twenty English speaking-were chosen
from the best intellects of the country to

SENATE
adopt such measures as might be deemed best
for the future welfare of the country, until
Canada should acquire the territory. Among
the twenty French who were chosen were
men of marked frontier ability and resource,
if not in every case of scholarly attainment.
Ambrose Lepine and Charles Nolin were both
highly educated. Pierre Delorme, an outstanding farmer, and Pierre Parenteau were
famed buffalo runners. Louis Schmidt, son
of a Hudson's Bay Company trader, had been
educated in Montreal. On the English side,
John Sutherland, whose father had served in
the Continental wars under the Duke of
Wellington, was a splendid example of the
pioneering Scot. He was afterwards a member of the Canadian Senate. Thomas Spence,
also a Scot, who organized the provisional
government, was a man of versatile ambitions. Dr. Curtis J. Bird, born at Red River,
had been educated in London and has gained
a reputation for professional ability. James
Rose, a Scotch Metis who had graduated with
high honours from Toronto University, was
an able lawyer and a former editor of the
Toronto Globe. Robert Tait, of Orkney
descent, was a trader, farmer and freighter.
Thomas Burne, an English Metis, had acted
as chairman of the great open air meeting
at which it was decided to form a government. Judge Black, Chief Justice under the
Hudson Bay Company rule was probably the
most respected citizen in the settlement. Rev.
Henry Cochran, a full-blooded Cree Indian,
was in charge of the Anglican Mission of St.
Peter's near the mouth of the Red River.
Henry Prince was an Indian Chief of the
Saulteux Indians. (The North West Mounted
Police, by J. P. Turner, p. 44.)
At the time the provisional government was
first formed, Louis Riel was living quietly
on his mother's farm. But he was so wise
and reasonable that the natives had worn a
trail to his home seeking his advice and
guidance in dealing with their acute problems. He was a brilliant young man of 24
years and had served the provisional government as its secretary. After the election in
1870 the elected members made him their
president.
The main business of the newly-elected government was to send delegates to Ottawa with
a bill of rights to negotiate with the Government of Canada, particularly to protect the
natives in their homes and to obtain a measure of responsible government for the settlement. In his excellent book The Life and
Times of Louis Riel, at page 34, W. M. Davidson points out that on the suggestion of
Donald A. Smith, who was vested with
authority by the Canadian Government, a
committee of three was sent to Ottawa to

present their ideas to the government after
Smith had given this undertaking:
On behalf of the Canadian Government I promise
you that the delegation will be hospitably received.

When the delegates reached Ontario, they
were arrested and charged with the murder
of one Scott.
Scott had been an insolent trouble maker in
the Red River settlement. In 1869 he went
to Portage La Prairie, where he induced more
than a hundred men to make an attack on
the provisional government at Fort Garry.
On arriving there and seeing the existing
state of affairs for themselves, many of them
deserted him. But he led a few to make a
dash on the home of Riel, presumably to kill
him. But Riel was not at home at the time.
At Fort Garry Scott's men arrested a subnormal boy named Parisien, whom they mistook for a Metis spy. They jailed him for
the night. In the morning Scott beat him so
cruelly that he died within a day or two.
Scott and his faction then made a demonstration before the Fort, calling the Metis cowards
who would not fight. The guards were
enraged and swarmed out, seized Scott and
imprisoned him. The Metis demanded of Riel
that Scott be tried by a court martial. Riel
refused. The governing body then took the
initiative and insisted that Scott stand trial.
He was tried by a court of seven members.
Scott was found guilty; six of the seven
judges favored the death sentence; and he
was executed by a firing squad on March
4, 1870.
The delegates charged in Ontario with the
murder of Scott were discharged, as there
was no case made out against them. The delegates then conferred with the Government of
Canada. As a result of the conference, an
agreement, pursuant to which a transfer of
the Northwest Territories was made to
Canada, was approved. An Imperial order
in council was passed declaring:
that from and after the 15th day of July, 1870,
the said Northwest Territories shall be admitted
into and become part of the Dominion of Canada
and that the Parliament of Canada shall from
...
the day aforesaid have full power and authority to
legislate for the future welfare and good government of the Territory.

This for the first time gave Canada rights
in the Northwest Territories. The Manitoba
Act was also passed giving the area a measure
of self government. (Turner, p. 60.)
But the Canadian Government refused a
promised amnesty for Riel and his associates.
It announced that it was sending an army of
1,200 men to Red River under Colonel Wolseley. As the army neared Red River, Wolseley sent one Butler to interview Riel. Riel
told Butler that the Red River would receive
Wolseley's army on its "mission of peace"

DECEMBER 10, 1952
with a friendly welcome, and that he, Riel,
would resign his authority to the Lieutenant
Governor of Manitoba immediately upon his
arrival.
As Wolseley's army came in sight from Fort
Garry, Riel received reports from reliable
scouts that Wolseley's plan was to "capture
by surprise Fort Garry, where Riel and his
colleagues would be waiting to receive him,
and capture or kill Riel in the battle." Riel,
members of the Council and many leading
citizens thereupon evacuated the fort and
abandoned it to Wolseley. (Davidson, p. 48.)
To add to the excitement and discontent,
while Canada was thus repeatedly committing
wrongs against the natives, a number of
immigrants, mostly from Ontario, had come
to the country, and had located in the village
of Winnipeg. They treated the natives with
the utmost contempt. A paper called the
Nor'Wester, published by one of their number,
was very abusive towards the natives. It
referred to them as a "lower class". It dwelt
on the inferiority of the Indians and Metis. It
was insolent and vicious in its scathing
vituperation. Its objectionable articles often
appeared in the Ontario press. This developed
a feeling of hatred against the Indians and
Metis throughout Canada. (Davidson, pp.
13 and 15.)
Writers of the history of the events to
which I have referred are pretty well agreed
as to what occurred. The differences between
them are largely in their approach to the
matters under discussion. Some writers
apparently looked upon the Indians and Metis,
not as human beings, but as wild animals or
savages that should be tamed, and maintained
that they should feel grateful to the Government of Canada for being so kind and condescending as to undertake the task of taming
them. Other writers regarded the natives
as human beings who, as subjects of the
Queen, were endowed with the rights and
privileges of British subjects-the liberties
of free men guaranteed, after bitter strife, by
Magna Charta, the Bill of Rights and other
statutory pillars of liberty. (Turner, p. 31.)
In 1868 Canada invaded the Northwest with
no right, or color of right. The people of
the Northwest owed absolutely no allegiance
to Canada; yet many referred to the people
of the Northwest as traitors for defending
themselves against an unprovoked invasion
of their rights. If any one of us saw some
person shooting at us, without any provocation, and we had in hand a shield that would
turn away the bullet, we would use it in self
defence. The Indians and Metis did nothing
more than that. They were forced to defend

themselves against ruthless acts of aggression
and cruel tyranny-to put up a stand for
human freedom.
During the winter following the arrival of
Wolseley's army, many residents of Red River,
particularly the Indians and Metis, were
forced to live as outcasts, in danger of arrest
on specious charges of murder, treason, and
what not; many of them to avoid persecution
fied westward and settled on the Saskatchewan river near Prince Albert. In their new
abode the land was still open prairie. They
settled on river lots as at Red river. They
built homes, improved their lands arid applied
for title. Their applications were ignored.
On the transfer of the territory to Canada the
government agreed to respect the rights of the
Indians and Metis; yet in 1883 they were told
that they could not stay on their locations.
The farms which they had reclaimed from
the wilderness were taken from them without
compensation. They asked that they be
granted river lots suitable to their way of
living, but this was refused without explanation. The Canadian government ousted them
from their homes, denied them a measure of
self government, and even refused to listen
to the pleas of their leaders. This again
created discontent. The government raised
an army which attacked and subdued them
by force. The Metis had to migrate again
and make another fresh start. The Indians
were huddled off to reserves that had in the
meantime been set aside for thern. (Davidson,
p. 70.).
Many of Riel's associates fled to Montana.
They urged him to flee with them. He
refused, saying he would surrender, stand
his trial, and answer for their alleged sins.
To his cousin "Nault" he said:
Cousin, you must go, but I arn going to surrender.
After my enemies get me, they will be joyous and
satisfied, and my people will get justice and be
safe. If I do not, then the others will be caught
and punished for me. (Davidson, p. 94.)

Riel surrendered and was tried. In preparing for his trial, the defence asked the
government for a safe-conduct guarantee for
witnesses from Montana. The government
refused this. The witnesses might come and
give evidence, but they would have to take
the chance of being arrested and having to
stand trial. They did not come. Without
his witnesses, Riel was found guilty and
hanged. (Davidson, pp. 94 to 98).
Thus
ended the career of a great statesman-a wise
and aggressive advocate of security and fair
play for the Indians and Metis on the prairie.
He sacrificed his life for them. They in turn
practically worshipped him, mourned his
death, and were overwhelmed with grief
because Ottawa took the life of their hero.

SENATE

Up to this time the Indians and Metis were
persenited hy the Government of Canada.
which was at all times implacable towards
them, and by the new settlers who openly
despised and ridiculed them. They were
forced to live lives of discouraged and heartbroken citizens. In view of the terrible
persecutions to which they were subjected,
great perserverance and tact will be required
to build up their morale. Up to this day many
Indians have a strong prejudice against
surveys being made on their reserves, and
strongly object to them. They are afraid of
what might happen.
Seventy-five years ago Canada planted the
Indians on reserves, where they lived separate
and apart from non-Indians. At that time
there were, in what is now Alberta, a few
ranches, a few trappers and a few white
people. The rest of the population was made
up almost entirely of Indians and persons of
mixed blood. By then the Mounted Police
had entered the country and were commencing
to make a name for themselves for maintaining law and order. There was no agriculture in Southern Alberta at that time. The
Indians were not educated, and knew little
or nothing of the white man, of his manner
of earning a livelihood or of life in the
settled communities.
In 1877 Canada entered into a treaty with
the Stoney Indians of Alberta. Under it the
Indians ceded and yielded up to Canada "all
their rights, titles and privileges whatsoever
to all other lands" in Canada. In consideration therefore, among other things, Canada
assigned to the Stoney Indians a reserve of
sufficient area to allow one square mile for
each family of five persons, or in that proportion for larger or smaller families.
The reserve assigned to them was not then
and is not now arable land, but almost
entirely a gravel bed. The blades of grass
growing on it are so scattered and withered
by drought, owing to the lack of soil to hold
moisture, that the land is of little value
for pasture. The gravel has no commercial
value. It is impossible for the Indians to
earn a living there no matter how hard they
try.
As the Indians knew nothing of growing
crops, they could not look into the future to
see that the land would be practically useless
to them. As a matter of fact, they agreed to
the location because the Blackfeet Indians,
who were much more numerous and belligerent, used to raid the Stoneys, rape their
women and steal their horses and food. The
Stoneys at that time liked the location, as
there they could better defend themselves
from the ruthless attacks of the Blackfeet.
At the time the Stoneys treated they had

no means of knowing of the splendid protection the "Red Coats" would afford them.
On the other hand, those who treated with
the Stoneys on behalf of Canada must have
known how necessary it was for the Indians
to have land that could be cultivated, and on
which they could grow vegetables for themselves and feed for their livestock. The
parties were not dealing at arm's length. A
quasi-fiduciary relation existed between them.
Yet Canada took an unfair advantage of these
ignorant Indians. By signing the treaty, the
Indians became wards of Canada. Although
this occurred 75 years ago, Canada has done
little to right the wrongs it then did them.
By the treaty of 1877, Canada also undertook to educate the children of the Stoney
Indians. In this respect Canada has failed
to carry out the spirit of its treaty obligations. From the years 1910 to 1926 the
number of children of school age on this
reserve varied from about ninety to a hundred and twenty. For only a few of those
years was there a day school there, and it
some thirty-five children.
accommodated
Apart from that school, although the parents
were clamoring for schools, those Indian
children received no scholastic training whatsoever. For several years since 1926 there
has been no school accommodation for many
of the children.
The attitude of Canada towards the prairie
Indians before the treaty and for many years
thereafter cannot be too strongly condemned.
When Canada first wronged them at .Red
River, and later further west, they were
prosperous and happy according to their
mode of living. Had she encouraged them in
their plan of settlement, and had she permitted a few years of peaceful schooling
under Riel and others like him, and nursed
them along to some extent when they had
to give up hunting and trapping to earn a
living by tilling the soil, the Indians would
no doubt have long ago been fully absorbed
into the life of this country as valuable
citizens. But instead of that the Indians have
been so humiliated that it will be some considerable time before many of them can
assume the full responsibilities of adult Canadians. A few of the present generation may
become emancipated and enfranchised, but
not many. In some cases this will take
another generation; in others it will take
longer.
During the last few years, the work of
the officers of the department, and those in
charge of Indian affairs on the reserves, has
been highly commendable. They appear to
be doing their best to enable the Indians
to become free citizens. However, I feel that

DECEMBER 10, 1952
more can be done by changing government
policy. I have a very high regard for the
minister who has charge of this matter. He
has imagination, foresight and courage. I am
hopeful that he will consider an appeal to
hasten the time when the Indians will
become self-reliant and on an equal footing
with their fellow citizens. With this in view,
I have some suggestions to make which I
hope will receive his favourable consideration.
First, to build up their morale: There is an
inherent desire in all men and women to be
treated and regarded as human beings, vested
with what our Prime Minister has referred to
as "the freedom and equality of men in
dignity as well as rights", able to live in
freedom and self-respect, having the same
opportunities and being on an equality with
other citizens. Man is the expression of the
Divine Being-the key to human freedom.
There is nothing that will do more to build
up the morale of a downtrodden people than
to be so treated that they can feel that they
are regarded as free human beings. No pains
should be spared in this respect. The position
of the Indians calls for much knowledge,
sympathetic understanding and tact on the
part of the different representatives of Indian
Affairs.
I suggest that the Director of Indian Affairs
or one of his assistants should visit each
reserve throughout Canada once each year
in order to hold a meeting with the Supervisor of Indian Affairs, the Agent on the
reserve, the farm foreman, the school principal, the minister of the Gospel, the Indian
chiefs, and the Indian councillors, and get
their suggestions and the benefit of their combined wisdom in planning for the ensuing
year. The Director could then formulate his
plans, always with an eye to carrying out the
wishes of the Indians as far as practical and
the emancipation of one or more Indians or
Indian families at the earliest possible date.
Such consultations would be helpful in the
way of building up the morale of the Indians
and would tend to develop a better esprit-decorps between the Indians and the nonIndians. Conferences, vis-a-vis, between the
government and the Indians would build up
confidence, and at the same time the Director
would get valuable ideas from such conferences.
Next, as to owning their own homes: The
right to own and be unmolested in his home
gives a man a feeling of spiritual freedom and
dignity without which he cannot be a worthwhile citizen. The right is fundamental. The
private ownership of property is not an evil;
it is a positive good. It is the foundation of

a free society. Any patriotic citizen will put
up a struggle to maintain it.
You may say that the Indian has a home on
the reserve, but he cannot say that one foot
of the reserve is his. The title stands in the
name of the Crown. No treaty Indian owns
his home outright. He did have title to it in
the Red River settlement, but it was taken
from him. If the Indian owned his home outright he could take a pride in it, build it up
and make it attractive. Ownership would
help greatly to make him feel that he is as
good as his non-Indian neighbour.
Under the Indian Act, sec. 20, the Minister
may issue a certificate of possession to an
Indian. As soon as it appears that a certain
portion of a reserve will ultimately pass to
a particular Indian, his home should be
established on that particular portion.
Then, as to education: Without schooling,
Indian children on reaching manhood cannot
compete in the economic field with educated
non-Indians. The adult Stoney Indians of
today have had little schooling-many of
them none at all. However, in schooling
Indian children the department is confronted
with difficult problems, particularly on the
Stoney Reserve. Yet more should be done
for them.
(1) There should be school accommodation
for all children of school age;
(2) Every residential school on a reserve
should have a gymnasium. The children
should not only be taught "the three Rs",
but should also be trained in sports. Nothing
will do more to develop downcast boys and
girls, physically and spiritually, than good
clean sport. If children are brought up to
loaf about in idleness, without being active
enough to get exercise after leaving school
they will be nothing more than loafers and
idlers;
(3) At the residential schools the boys
should be given more manual training and
the girls more domestic science. These
services that I suggest would cost more
than the training now given, but in the long
run they would pay dividends.
As to incentive: Life on a reserve takes
one who should be a free man and disciplines him; it puts him under a planner at
Ottawa; it is a return to the feudal system
from which man freed himself after a long,
hard struggle. The Indian should be freed
as soon as possible, so that he may fully
enjoy the spirit of free competition, which
is one of our main driving forces. Each
should not only be rewarded, but should
fully see the reward for his achievement,
and thus be encouraged to push on to still

SENATE
greater effort and achievement. All should
he encnuraged in every way possible to
master the problems of life.
It is impossible to build up men of spirit,
confidence and enterprise in any walk of
life so long as they continue to be wards,
without the incentive which comes from
responsibilities, with rights which are the
rights of children rather than of adults.
Paternalism is not a goal to stir up one's
ambition. Let us get away from it.
In my opinion, as soon as the department
feels that an Indian is capable of handling
his own affairs, he should be emancipated
and enfranchised and given title to a portion
of the reserve. Under section 110 of the
Act, an Indian upon becoming enfranchised
may receive a share of the trust assets of
his reserve, other than land, but he is
stripped of his share of the land. This does
not seem to me to be right. In my opinion he
should be given a share of the land too.
In the year 1910 the Indians of British
Columbia said to the Canadian Government:
Today the Indian people of British Columbia
ask to be put on the same level as the white man.
They say: Come let us settle the title to these
lands. Then give us title to land in fee simple,
family by family. Take away your Indian Act;
take away your Indian Agent. Take away your
Indian reserve system; put us into your citizenship,
and we will rise or fall even as other men do.
(McDougall of Alberta by John Maclean, p. 248).

It should be made clear to the Indians now
that as soon as they become capable of looking after their own interests they will get
title to a full share of the reserve. That
would do much to revive their spirits and

stimulate them to greater efforts. They should
be given greater scope, month after month,
year after year, in handling their own affairs,
until they become as free to manage these
as non-Indians. Then the incentive to succeed
would be there, as it would be clear to them
that they would benefit as a result of their
efforts. The present adult Indians would be
slow to apply themselves actively, but I
believe that with proper schooling many of
their children would make good. Until a plan
is fully worked out, and the last Indian on
a reserve is emancipated, the tribal organization should be maintained and the power of
the chiefs supported. Their customs and
usages should be retained by the Indians so
long as they continue to live on reserves, in
order to preserve contact with reality while
preparing to embark on a new and strange
existence.
The sturdy individualism which inspired
progress in the past, which has created all
our best human values, seems to me essential
to all true progress. Its replacement by a
servile mentality is the greatest human
menace of our times. Al humans crave for
freedom. Huddled on a reserve as wards of
Canada the Indians have made little progress
during the past seventy-five years. Let us
give them a chance to seek their happiness
in freedom.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Honourable senators, I
move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at

Prayers and routine proceedings.
TRADE MARKS BILL
INQUIRY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, I
should like to ask a question of the leader
of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson).
Before doing so, however, may I congratulate
him and the other members of the Banking
and Commerce Committee on their recently
acquired title of "Comrades"?
Some Hon. Senators: Oh! Oh!
Hon. Mr. Reid: My question is this. At the
last session there was introduced a bill
entitled The Trade Marks Act. It was not
proceeded with, and I am wondering if the
leader bas any information as to whether
It may be reintroduced this session.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: During the period
immediately preceding the recent opening of
parliament, in my scurrying around for all
available legislation I brought to the attention
of my colleagues the fact that the bill the
honourable gentleman mentions had been
introduced last session. I was informed that,
because of representations made, the measure
was still under consideration, and in all
likelihood would not be presented to parliament before Christmas.
If my honourable friend presses me as to
how long after Christmas it will be before the
bill reaches us-if indeed it does reach usI arn not in a position to answer him. However, I have drawn the attention of my colleagues to the matter, and I am assured that
the bill will not reach us before Christmas.
CABINET RESPONSIBILITY

1952

The burden of the editorial is that, ln the
remarks made by me in the debate on the
motion for an Address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne I expressed opinions contrary to those held by my colleagues, and
thereby violated the principle of cabinet
solidarity. The particular part of my address
which is commented upon is that portion in
which I expressed my views as to what might
be accomplished within the spirit of a resolution moved by the honourable senator from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) in 1950, which I
supported and which was adopted by this
house.
I wish to place on the record the comments
made on a similar resolution by the Honourable L. B. Pearson, Secretary of State for
External Affairs, so that this house may be
appraised of the extent to which, if any, I
departed from his viewpoint with respect to
the question of closer co-operation between
members of NATO.
On February 26, 1951, Mr. Stewart, of
Winnipeg North, moved in the other place
as follows:
That, in the opinion of this house, the government should take into consideration the advisability
of supporting the calling of a convention of delegates from the democracies which sponsored the
North Atlantic Treaty and representing the principal political parties of such democracies, for the
purpose of exploring how far their peoples, and
the peoples of such other democracies as the convention may invite to send delegates, can apply
among them, within the framework of the United
Nations, the principles of federal union.

Honourable senators will note that that
resolution is almost identical with one presented to and passed by this house.
The Honourable Mr. Pearson in speaking
to this motion said, as appears at page 689 of
the House of Commons Debates:
Mr. Speaker, I feel I should say a few words
about this resolution which bas been moved in such
eloquent terms by the hon. member who has
just taken his seat. I should say at once that
I support, and think the government supports,
the purposes and principles and the idealism which
underlie this resolution.
But I am not myself
certain that those purposes could best be achieved
or those principles best implemented by the procedure recommended in the resolution.

NEWSPAPER ARTICLE-QUESTION OF
PRIVILEGE

Mr. Pearson proceeded to advance very
cogent reasons as to why, in his opinion, the
On the Orders of the Day:
immediate steps proposed were not calcuHon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators, lated to best serve the objective which the

refer to an editorial which appeared in this be taken along the lines suggested. In conmorning's Montreal Gazette, under the head- cluding his address, however-I quote from
ing "For Whom Does Senator Robertson page 692-he said:
I said not very long ago "that our North AtlanSpeak?" The opening paragraph of this editic alliance may provide the foundation for a great
torial reads as follows:

and makes his own pronouncement upon public
policy.

which one day may become a political commonwealth.
You may say that this is unrealistic nonsense, but
I suggest that in this jet-propelled atomic age no

less than this will do". So far as I am concerned
I

that

nt

this time the calling of a conference of the type
indicated by the resolution would make any
appreciable advance to the attainment of the ultimate objective, which remains a commonwealth
of the free world. Therefore, in order that we in
this house may not give the appearance of diversion
and disunity on a matter as to which we are all
fundamentally united, I would venture to express
the hope that this resolution may not be pressed
to a vote at this time.

Now I come as to the question of what I
said. After I had completed the major part
of my address with respect to public questions, in which I spoke on the question of
mutual defence and increased volume of
multilateral trade, I referred to the motion
proposed by the honourable senator from
Waterloo in 1950, and its far-sightedness.
I mentioned the fact that I had been asked
what the Senate's resolution meant, and I
proceeded to set out my beliefs as to what
could be accomplished within the spirit of
this resolution. I leave it to the judgment
of individual senators to decide how far, in
presenting this ideal, I departed from the
viewpoint so eloquently expressed by the
Secretary of State for External Affairs in the
speech from which I have just quoted.
May I add, honourable senators, a further
word of comment? It has occurred to me
that while the parliamentary press respresentative of the Montreal Gazette took five
days to discover that I had made the speech,
it took his editor only five minutes to read
it, and an even shorter time to refresh his
memory as to what Mr. Pearson had said in
the past on this very point. The editor's
transparent attempt to create an issue arises
most of all from his fervent belief in protection and my implied suggestion of the
desirability of increased multilateral trade.
In the course of my remarks I referred to
Stalin's instructions to his followers in the
NATO countries to spearhead the campaign
in opposition to increased co-operation
between them in trade matters. I have no
doubt that Stalin's hatchet-men in Canada,
following their instructions, are already planning their campaign wondering where they
can find respectable allies. Perhaps they
should give the editorial room of the Montreal
Gazette the once-over; for here they might
find someone with the tune well in mind, to
join them in singing the modern rendition of
"No truck nor trade with the Yankees".
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

FOOD AND DRUGS BILL
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS

CONCURP.ED IN

11, 1952
Two of the most important amendments
before us have to do with sections 21 and 24
of the bill. Section 21 sets out the powers
of inspectors, and a few days ago when I was
hast dealing with the bull I commented upon
the great wideness of these powers. Section
24 is the one that authorizes the Governor iu
Council ta make regulations for carrying the
purposes and provisions of the Act into effeet,
including the definiug of that most important
expression "1adulterated".
Honourable senators, I should hike to hear
from the chairman of the committee (Hon.
Mr. Veniot) some explanation of what the
committee has doue with the bill and what
is invohved in the proposed ameudments, particularly the ameudments of the two sections
I have mentioued.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Would the chairman's statement close the debate?
Han. Mr. ]Roehuck: Not necessarily; he
would simply be answering a question.
Hon. Mr. Veniot: Honourable senators, it
was not my intention to make any remarks
concerning the amendments to this bull. However, I am glad that the senator from TorontoTrinity <Hon. Mr. Roebuck) bas focused the
attention of the bouse, on two clauses which
aroused a great deal 0f discussion, namely,
clauses 21 and 24. As it would be very
difficuit for bonourable members to visualize
the new clauses as draited by simply looking at tbe proposed ameudments as printed
in the Minutes of Proceedings, I took it upon
myself to write out these clauses as they
will appear iu the redrafted bill.
Paragrapb (a) of subchause (1) of section
21 was entirely deleted, and the other paragrapbs of the subclause were renumbered lu
consequence-that is, paragraph (b) now
becomes paragraph (a), and so on.
Tbe redrafted clause 21 will read as
follows:

The Senate proceeded to -consideration of
amendments made by the Standing Committee on Public Health and Welf are on
Bill J, an Act respecting food, drugs, cosmetics and tberapeutic devices.
Hon. Mr. Veniot moved concurrence in
the ameudments.
Han. Arthur Roebuck: Honourable senators,
the house will remember that when this
bill was before us for second reading I mentioued its importance to the public, and I
asked the committee to whom the bill was
referred to give it a thorough review. I also
suggested that the members of the committee read the bill as tbough tbey were
"from. Missouri" and to revise it with great
care. As a member of that committee I
arn sorry that I was unable to be present
during the committee meetings except ou
one occasion-and I do want to acknowledge
the courtesy displayed by the chairman and
the other members of the committee at that
time. .I am under the impression that the
bill has been.given a very thorougb review.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roobuck: I notice that there are
no fewer than thirty-nine amendments recommeuded by the committee in the report which
we are now considering. I understand the
committee held four long sittings, at which
representations were heard from ail parties

(d) seize and detain for such time as may be
necessary any article by means of or in relation to
Act or the regulations have been violated.

The chief objection voiced by several honourable senators to subclause (1) of clause
21 in the original bill was that paragraph (a)
would allow an inspector to enter anybody's
home at any time, day or night, if he thought
-on reasonable grounds or not-that there
was on the premises some article which was
adulterated or in any way a contravention
of the Act. The revamped subclause does
away with this objectionable feature.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Would you the honourable senator read the amendment to paragraph (a) again?
Hon. Mr. Veniot: The original paragraph (a)
was completely deleted, and I just read the
amended subclause.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Under the amendment,
what places may an inspector enter?
Hon. Mr. Veniot: He may enter any place
where, on reasonable grounds, he believes
any article to which this Act or regulations
apply is manufactured, prepared, preserved,
packaged or stored. That is, he may not enter
a private house or cottage; he is restricted
to the entering of a place of manufacture,
preparation, preservation, packaging or storing.
Now I come to clause 24, the one which
empowers the Governor in Council to make
regulations. The chief point of contention
on this was that the Governor in Council
was being given too wide powers to define
"adulterated", and the clause has now been
amended so as to remove the objection on
this ground. In amending this clause also
the committee struck out entirely paragraph
(a) of subclause 1, and in consequence renumbered the remaining paragraphs. The
redrafted clause reads as follows:
24 (1). The Governor in Council may make regulations for carrying the purposes and provisions of
this Act into effect, and, in particular, but not so
as to restrict the generality of the foregoing, may
make regulations
(a) declaring that any food or drug or class of
food or drugs is adulterated if any prescribed
substance or class of substances is present therein
or has been added thereto or extracted or omitted
therefrom.

The new words are, "is present therein or".
This gives a clear definition of "adulteration",
and was accepted by the committee as
appearing satisfactory to both the manufacturers and the general public.
The remainder of the clause did not
undergo many changes, except in sub-paragraph (iv) of paragraph (b), which now reads:
The use of any substance as an ingredient in
any food, drug, cosmetic or device, to prevent the

consumer or purchaser thereof from being deceived
or misled as to its quantity, character, value, compoiin

ei

the health of the consumer or purchaser.

Those, honourable senators, are the main
changes which were made in clauses 21 and
24.
May I add that there is no intention on
the part of the department to impose arbitrary and unjust restrictions on any manufacturer of food or drugs. The point was
made quite clear to the committee. The only
manufacturers who have anything to fear
from the department's definition of "adulteration" are those rare few who are interested
in making big money by putting on the
market products which do not conform to
the standards of quality and quantity which
have been prescribed for the protection of
the consumer. I am sure honourable senators
will agree with the aims and objects of the
bill as I have stated them.
While I am on my feet, may I add that
the officials of the department were very
co-operative and understanding with respect
to the proposed amendments to the bill. As
a result, I believe we have a measure that
is satisfactory to the department, the manufacturers and the public at large.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I do
not intend to delay the passage of this
measure, but I should like to say a few words.
When the bill first came before the house
I, like the honourable member from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), had rather mixed
feelings about it. I attended all the committee
meetings except the last one, which came on
a day when we had a total of five cornmittees sitting, three of which, I may say,
I attended.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: All at the same time?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: You are slipping.
Hon. Mr. Haig: After attending the meetings of this committee which I was able to
attend, I came away with the impression that
the chairman had handled things extremely
well.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: He did not try to push the
legislation through; if any member of the
committee objected and wanted more time,
he readily gave it. Further, he put at ease
members of the public who came to make
representations. For instance, Dr. Shute of
London who appeared before the committee
was so excited when he started that I thought
he might collapse-

DECEMBER 11, 1952
Han. Mr. Beaubien: He should take some
of his Vitamen E.
Hlon. Mr. Haig: -but he soon cooled off,
and gave a fine presentation.
Aiso, I came away from the committee
with a very fine impression of the officiais
of the department.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: So did I.
Hon. Mr. Haig: One often, gets the impression that departmental officiais f eel that they
have some authority and intend to run
matters. In this instance, it was exactly the
opposite; they impressed me as beiieving that
adulterated food was a bad thing for the
health of the people of Canada and that the
whole object was to prevent such an article
being placed on the market. At the same
time, they were wiliing to co-operate with
manufacturers and dealers in trying to work
out amendments to the Act which wouid flot
be detrimental to either side. Therefore I
express my pleasure at having had the opportunity to participate in the consideration of

APPENDIX A
COMMONWEALTH CONFERENCFE-FORM OF- ROYAL STYLE AND TITLE
OFFICE OF THE PRIME MINISTER
CANADA

Ottawa, December 12, 1952
The prime ministers and other representatives of commonwealth countries assembled
in London for the commonwealth economic
conference have considered the form of the
Royal Title.
They recognized that the present title is
not in accord with current constitutional relations within the commonwealth, and that
there is need for a new form of title which
will, in particular, reflect the special position
of the sovereign as head of the commonwealth. They concluded, after full consideration, that in the present stage of development
of the commonwealth relationship, it would
be in accord with the established constitutional position that each member country
should use for its own purposes a form of
title which suits its own particular circumstances but retains a substantial element
which is common to all. They agreed that
the various forms of the title should, in addition to an appropriate territorial designation,
have as their common element the description
of the sovereign as queen of her other realms
and territories and head of the commonwealth.
The representatives of aIl the commonwealth countries concerned have agreed to
take, at the earliest convenient opportunity,
such action as is necessary in each country
to secure the appropriate constitutional
approval for the changes now envisaged.
Her Majesty will then be advised to exercise
her prerogative power by the issue of proclamations giving effect to such changes in
the title as may be recommended. It is contemplated that the proclamations will be

68112-9

issued simultaneously in all the countries
concerned.
The form of title that will be recommended
for use in Canáda is:
"Elizabeth the Second, by the grace of God
of the United Kingdom, Canada and her other
realms and territories Queen, Head of the
Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith."
The titles to be recommended in the various countries of the commonwealth are as
follows:
United Kingdom-Elizabeth the Second, by
the grace of God of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of
her other realms and territories Queen, Head
of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith.
Canada-Elizabeth the Second, by the grace
of God of the United Kingdom, Canada and
her other realms and territories Queen, Head
of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith.

grace of God of the United Kingdom,
Australia and her other realms and territories
Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender
of the Faith.
New Zealand-Elizabeth the Second, by the

Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender
of the Faith.
South Africa-Elizabeth the Second, Queen
of South Africa and of her other realms and
territories, Head of the Commonwealth.

produce and supply under competitive conditions an expanding flow of exports. There
was, therefore, general agreement in the conference on the vital need to expand the earning power of all sterling countries.
DEVELOPMENT

POLICY

9. Throughout the commonwealth there is
wide scope for expanding the production of
the essential supplies which the whole world
needs food and agricultural products, minerals
and engineering products and im.proving the
means for transporting them. This development of the basic essentials has on occasion
been impeded by other development of a less
sound and permanent kind which has overtaxed the countries resources and has failed
to contribute to the building of economic
strength. The conference agreed that, in
sterling area countries, development should
be concentrated on projects which directly
or indirectly contribute to the improvement
of the areas' balance of payments with the
rest of the world. Such projects should
strengthen the economy of the countries concerned, and increase their competitive power
in world markets and so, by improving their
balance of payments, bring increasing prosperity to their peoples. In some countries of
the area, however, development plans have
been, or are being, made to provide for some
basic improvement in the standards of living
which is a necessary foundation for further
economic development. Some social investment is also urgently needed in the more
developed countries certain of which have
rapidly increasing populations. The conference recognized the need in such cases for
these types of investment.
10. To enable development to go forward a
sufficient flow of savings must be provided in
the countries undertaking the development
and also in other countries which are ready
to invest their savings there. The amount of
savings which will be available from external
sources will, at best, be small in relation to
the size of the development programmes of
countries of the sterling commonwealth and
it is therefore essential that these countries
should, themselves, adopt policies which
increase the flow of savings. Although this
is inevitably a slow process for countries with
low incomes and little margin above the basic
needs for existence, the process of development will itself, increase income and increase
the flow of savings.
11. The United Kingdom is the traditional
source of external capital for commonwealth
investment and has special responsibilities in
the colonial territories. The United Kingdom government are determined that the flow
of capital from London for sound develop68112-9j

ment throughout the commonwealth shall be
maintained and increased. This will only be
possible if the United Kingdom can sustain
the necessary level of internal savings and
can achieve a surplus on overseas account
additional to that required to meet its heavy
existing commitments.
12. The United Kingdom government have,
however, undertaken to make a special effort
to provide additional capital for commonwealth development by facilitating the financing of schemes in other commonwealth
.countries which will contribute to the improvement of the sterling areas' balance
payments. The conference took note that
the United Kingdom government would wish,
before making any of this additional finance
available for commonwealth development, to
be sure that the country concerned was,
itself, devoting an adequate part of its
resources to investment designed to improve
the sterling area's balance of payments and
was ready to make a sufficient contribution
towards the particular scheme in question to
ensure that both countries had an interest
in seeing that it was carried through as
efficiently and economically as possible.
13. The conference welcomed the proposal
by a group of important financial, industrial
and commercial concerns in the United Kingdom to form a company to further development in other countries of the commonwealth
and the colonial empire. It was pleased to
note that an announcement by this group is
being issued today. The conference also
welcomed a statement by the United Kingdom representatives that the United Kingdom
government intend to discuss with the international bank for reconstruction and development arrangements to give effect to their
decision to make sterling available for lending
by the bank for projects designed to improve
the sterling area's balance of payments.
14. The conference recognised the important contribution which investors outside the
sterling area, particularly in the United
States, can make to economic development
in the sterling area and agreed that every
effort should be made to create conditions
which would encourage such investment. It
further agreed ithat all sterling area governments should strive to attain this by reducing
such obstacles as controls over the movements of capital across the exchanges. The
United Kingdom government have reviewed
the right which is now enjoyed by residents
outside the sterling area, who have invested
capital in approved projects in the United
Kingdom and colonial empire since lst January, 1950, to transfer their capital across the
exchanges. At present this right only extends

government

informed the conference that they have
decided that, henceforth, it shall extend also
to capital profits.
COMMODITY POLICY

15. The Conference recognized that there
was no one universal remedy for the problem
of instability of prices for primary commodities. Each commodity must be considered
on its merits in the light of the conditions
prevailing at the time and the circumstances
must determine what form of arrangements
would be appropriate. The conference agreed
that violent fluctuations and an uneconomic
level of prices for primary commodities were
against the interests of consumers as well as
producers. All commonwealth governments
are, therefore, ready to co-operate in considering commodity by commodity international
schemes designed to ensure stability of
demand and prices at an economic level. They
also recognize the need for an agreed procedure for calling together the governments
concerned to consider emergency action in
the event of rapidly developing conditions of
surplus or shortage of commodities entering
into international trade.

conclusions recorded above will, in itself, do
much to strengthen the economies of the
sterling commonwealth countries but this is
not enough. Action in a wider sphere is also
necessary. The conference therefore agreed
to seek the co-operation of other countries in
a plan to create the conditions for expanding
world production and trade. The aim is to
secure international agreement on the adoption of policies by creditor and debtor countries which will restore balance in the world
economy on the lines of "trade not aid" and
will, by progressive stages and within reasonable time, create an effective multilateral
trade and payments system covering the
widest possible area.
TRADE

18. The plan envisages positive international
action for the progressive removal, as circumstances permit, of import restrictions imposed
for the purpose of bringing a country's external accounts into balance. Action will be
required by both creditor and debtor countries. The rate of progress in removing
discrimination will depend upon the advance
towards equilibrium between the United
States and the rest of the world.

APPENDIX C
NATIONAL DEFENCE-REPORT BY MR. G. S. CURRIE
REPORT ON THE CANADIAN ARMY WORKS SERVICES WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE
TO THE IRREGULARITIES UNCOVERED AT CAMP PETAWAWA
November 26, 1952
The Honourable Brooke Claxton, D.C.M.,
Q.C., M.P.,
Minister of National Defence,
Ottawa, Canada
Dear Sir,
In accordance with your request of April
21, 1952, I have conducted an investigation
into -the deficiencies and other irregularities
of the engineering detachment of the army
works services at Petawawa and elsewhere.
My terms of reference were contained in
your telegram of that date as follows:
Confirming telephone please undertake immediate
investigation and report earliest possible date
into déficiencies and other irregularities engineering detachment at Petawawa and related matters
there, or elsewhere both to determine cause and
make recommendations regarding security and
accounting for stores equipment and services so
as to prevent recurrence with any additional
powers or terms of reference which are necessary
to make complete and thorough investigation and
report.

I accepted this task. May I express my
thanks to you and to all departments of
government, including of course the Department of National Defence, for the ready and
full co-operation afforded me. I found the
terms of reference suggested by you ample
and complete for the purposes of the inquiry.
It should be noted tha-t interim suggestions
made by me during my Investigations have
been already seized on, and important
reforms are already being carried out.
My investigations have taken me not only
to Petawawa, but also to Toronto, London,
Borden, Barriefield, Vancouver, Regina,
Quebec and Halifax. At all these points
comprehensive general examinations were
made of works companies and detachments.
PART I-THE IRREGULARITIES

AT

PETAWAWA

AND THEIR CAUsES

The conclusion I have come ta is that,
while there has been a general breakdown
in the system of administration, supervision
and accounting, it was only at Petawawa that
extensive irregularities over a prolonged
period of time took place. The contents of
this chapter tare chiefly based upon my
studies there, because of the existence there
of a combination of factors: lax control, poor

discipline and the presence of dishonest personnel. The combination proved disastrous.
I-t is mentioned in this context chiefiy for
the purpose of praising the personnel at
other depots for not walking through the door
which a fundamentally loose situation had
opened before them. It does not fit the facts
to indiet or to smear the whole army works
services personnel because of the sins of a
handful of crooks.
The Discovery of the Irregularities
and their Nature
At Petawawa, however, the crooks were
present and took advantage of the situation,
and it is an unhappy circumstance tha-t the
beginning of this investigation lies not inside
the Department of National Defence and its
full complement of regulations and supervising personnel, but with the receipt of an
anonymous letter couched in the following
terms:
The Commissioner,
Royal Canadian Mounted Police,
Ottawa, Ont.
Dear Sir,
There is reason to believe that an Illegal transaction of army goods has taken place between
army personnel of No. 3 works coy., R.C.E., and
................ company within the past few days.
This transaction involves the selling of several
railway car loads of cook stoves and heaters withThe C.P.R. station

agent at Petawawa village could give you the

destination of these cars.
No signature can be attached to this letter,
but a good number of taxpayers have seen this
deal and think that something should be done

about it.

If It is not an illegal deal, no harm

will be done if enquiries are made, but yet If it
is an illegal deal a number of other such transactions might be revealed.

Before reciting the irregularities and their
circumstances uncovered by the R.C.M.P.with the assistance later of the provincial
police and the army provost corps-it must
be said that internal warnings had not been
lacking in the Department of National Defence. The chief auditor of the department
had performed his functions conscientiously.
Time and again he had reported unsatisfactory conditions. This is clear from Appendix
"B" which summarizes his findings over a
period of years. The Deputy Minister
in each case had directed the quartermaster
general to investigate and report. Lack of

cases, worse. The 'protess Wa thèn again'
repeated.
-The actual irregularities uncovered at Petawawa are difficult to deal with in this report.
The reasons for this, and for my dependence
in large measure on police reports, are set
forth later. The difficulties are enhanced by
the fact that in various instances court proceedings have been instituted or are under
contemplation. It is important, at this time,
not to jeopardize these proceedings either
from the point of view of the crown or of the
accused. At the same time, it seems to me
the public interest demands that this report
should include a more or less detailed description of the nature of the irregularities which
took place. I have therefore attempted to
summarize them.
You will remember that, in each case, army
personnel were involved; and that, in most
cases, whether proceedings are taken or not,
or whether these issue successfully for the
crown, army goods have been recovered by
the police which is fairly successful proof that
army goods were widely spread in places
where, under the regulations, they had no
business to be. In a substantial number of
cases, army personnel have signed statements
admitting the correctness of the facts stated.
A series of transactions concerned the disposal of scrap metal. In one case, a proper
contract was let for the disposal of 30 tons,
in another, of 15 tons. It seems 'that some 550
tons were shipped out of the camp area, and
that the proceeds from the bulk of the sale
were pocketed by army personnel. Some of
the metal thus shipped was not scrap at all.
It consisted of serviceable material such as
kitchen ranges, cannon heaters, shower-stalls,
sinks and the like. Most of this material was
recovered. In one striking instance, a large
quantity of rails belonging to the Canadian
Pacific Railway was removed. When this loss
was noted by the C.P.R. and questions raised,
a spur line of the Canadian National running
into the ordnance depot was taken up and the
rails used to replace the missing C.P.R. track.
Another case involved the collection of lead
from rifle butts and its private sale.
A contract was awarded for the clearing of
the camp "X" area. It covered the clearing of
206 acres, though only 166 acres were cleared
and that not satisfactorily. In this, as in the
scrap metal cases cited and, indeed, in others,

equipment. During the clearing of this area
horses were hired by army personnel and
and placed on the payroll under the names of
non-existent lábourers. In another instance, a
civllia'n empldyee of the' detachment got a
contract for cutting and hauling cedar poles.
Permission was given to use an army bulldozer and other equipment on the job. Lumber was apparently cut from the area to be
trucked to camp Petawawa. Its final destination cannot now be accurately traced.
An electric refrigerator was obtained from
a local hardware store, and billed to the
works department as other material. When
electric refrigerators became available, the
steel ice-boxes previously used were not returned to stores but turned into a hardware
store and traded for other merchandise chosen
by army personnel. A boat and several washing machines were obtained by putting
through a false order for 1,000 bags of cement.
The boat has been traced at Petawawa and
one of the washing machines was located in
the men's quarters. Rolls of linoleum were
stolen, some of which was recovered later.
Two freight carloads of pulpwood appear to
have been stolen during the cutting of a power
line.
In various Instances it has been ascertained
that army personnel were employed to construct such articles as boats, desks, beds,
chests of drawers, coffee tables, chairs and,
in one instance, a child's rocking horse, all
for private use and not for government service. The material used was army material,
and, though some of it, the latter at least, was
subsequently paid for by the personnel concerned, the wages of the workmen employed
were not.
A dam was built on Tucker Creek at a cost
estimated at some $3,000 or $4,000. Its utility
is not clear to me, and it was, in any event,
not authorized by army headquarters.
In certain cases, persons buying army
material were asked not to make cheques in
payment (in whole or in part) to the receiver
general but to individual army personnel. The
amounts thus paid did not reach the public
treasury.
In another case, a member of the detachment was hired by a private company and
paid for 13 weeks at the rate of $100 a week.
The company claimed its temporary employee
told it that accumulated leave would permit
him to fulfil his obligations which involved
the setting out and detailing of houses in the
camp Townsite. The man in question denies
this, stating he performed these private duties
in his spare time. He also denies that there

bags, much of which may have gone into unauthorized projects of one kind or another, or
wasted or pilfered in small quantities. It was
impossible to ascertain exactly what had
happened. But my test cement investigation
çonvinced me that to attempt a similar study
of all the 5,000 items of stores held would be
endless and probably fruitless.
In such circurnstances, when rigid accounting methods fail, police examination is the
only available recourse left. This has been
carried out with painstaking thoroughness,
and leads me to the belief that most, if not
all, the important irregularities have been uncovered. The police, too, have been able to
recover by far the greater quantity of the
missing goods, and these have been returned
to stores.
No reliable estimate of the total loss can
be prepared. It does, however, appear probable that the total loss resulting fron misappropriations and irregularities by military
personnel at Petawawa was not large. The
advantages gained by civilians dealing with
corrupt military personnel are not clearly ascertainable. My view would be, however,
that the Éenerally lax administrative situation
would give rise to waste and inefficiency far
more costly in loss than that covered by
actual dishonesty. The evidence examined
does not disclose irregularities involving
relatively large sums of money, but, rather,

was any secret and improper element in the
transaction which was, nevertheless, clearly
improper under the regulations.
Private and improper sales of gravel were
made by responsible personnel in charge of a
gravel pit leased under strict terms by the
Department of National Defence.
It was the practice at Petawawa to lend
cement and other materials from army stores
to private contractors in the district. No
record was kept of these loans, and the
materials were usually not returned until the
army asked for them. The explanation given
was that the private work being done was of
an urgent nature, that materials were scarce,
and that only the government had the priorities with which to obtain them. It was also
stated that personnel were not available to
keep the proper records.
A contractor received payment in full on a
$32,000 contract for laying sewer pipe and
manholes, although some $4,000 of the work
had been completed by the army before the
private contractor began work. The explanation in this case was that a Central Mortgage
and Housing Corporation inspector erroneously accepted verbal progress reports from
an assistant. The company also claims that
the payment asked for was the result of an
office employee being unfamiliar with procedures in such cases.

(31) Inaccurate distribution in cost records.
(32) Certain removeable equipment was

(33) Improper loans of materials and rental of equipment to civilian contractors.

Failure in Security
There was in addition a serious collapse
in security. There was little to prevent or to
detect the organized plundering of military
stores on a systematic scale, though apparently comparatively little of it took place. If
there is excuse for inefficient accounting, there
is none for the failure of security which is,
after all, a prime military consideration. I
take a serious view of this breakdown. If
it is easy to pilfer military stores, then, by
the same token, it is easy to sabotage military equipment. My recommendations in
this respect are fully outlined later.
S±rains of the Korean War
My investigations of the problems, difficulties and shortcomings of the army works
services outlined above suggest that they have
been caused for the most part-but by no
means altogether-by the tremendous and
sudden expansion of its activities brought
about by the Korean war and by the largescale defence program involved in carrying
out our NATO activities.
The establishment approved for the army
works services after the second world war
did not envisage the sudden expansion which
was to take place in 1950. It was designed
to carry out a purely peacetime role of
planning, development and construction on
an annual expenditure of approximately $20-,
000,000. This establishment became quickly
burdened under the impact of big-scale rearmament. In September, 1950, the program
was increased to about $80,000,000. In the
following April, it was increased to about
$200,000,000. The program envisaged in the
1952-53 fiscal year aggregates about $250,000,000. The magnitude of this responsibility
is reflected in an investment in plant and
buildings whi-h now amounts to $750,000,000 and is still rising.
During the 1952-53 period, the Petawawa
Detachment will expend something in excess
of $1,000,000 on its own account, as well as
having
administrative
responsibility for
supervising some $20,000,000 of new constuction performed by outside parties. It will
readily be seen that the detachment's job
is by no means a small one, but comparable
perhaps to a medium-sized commercial construction company.
On the circumstances of sudden re-armament, the army works services of necessity
was not permitted time to re-organize itself
for this tremendous expansion, particularly
since, it will be recalled, no one knew then
whether the communist aggression in Korea
was not the beginning of concerted SinoRussian attacks in all available theatres of

DECEMBER 15, 1952
war. Many sections of the services became
completely overwhelmed with work.
The situation was complicated by still
another factor. The Department of National
Defence (including the army works services)
was largely staffed and manned by men
whose military training had been received
in war-time. Its establishment and administrative practices refiected more clearly the
urgent needs and exigencies of war, when
speed is everything and costs count not at
all. The carry-forward of this war psychology
must be coupled with inadequate training and
resultant ignorance on the part of personnel
of their administrative duties and responsibilities. There was, in addition, indifference
and reluctance on the part of military personnel to concentrate on administration to
the degree required. It was not perhaps
unnatural that these'latter needs were largely
forgotten or deliberately overlooked as soldiers
gazed forward into the unknown consequences of the Korean outbreak, and foresaw still greater wars not very far away.
But, if this spirit permeated the lower
echelons of the army, it is more difficult to
condone the same attitudes higher up. There,
a higher degree both of intelligence and
responsibility is essential. It was not always
present in the degree required.
II-PROPOSED REORGANIZATION OF THE
ARMY WORKS SERVICES
Role of the Army Works Services
The army works services is not necessarily
a distinct and separate unit within an army.
It is, in Canada, an ad hoc organization,
drawn from various units and groupings,
chiefly the Royal Canadian Engineers, and
including a number of civilians. Its function
is to provide and care for accommodation of
al kinds for the maintenance of the active
and reserve forces of the Canadian army
in Canada, and to provide land and structures,
and care for them, in order to permit these
forces to carry out their tasks. Thus it
provides for defence and special works, provides and distributes engineer stores, creates
fire fi-ghting services and plans accommodation and other works requirements for
mobilization and war.
It is included in the 'composition of the
army for the sole purpose of providing
necessary facilities for the rest of the army.
It maintains the most direct contact with the
civil engineering profession in Canada and
its military components are thus kept abreast
of current engineering practice in all phases
of civil and related engineering.
68112-101
PART

Handling of Expenditures
Expenditures of the army works services
are estimated each year in advance, screened
carefully at all levels by the service, the
staff and finally by the general officers commanding and the chief of the general staff.
These are presented to the minister. The
usual annual programme of the army works
services comprises the following main tasks:
(1) The requisite maintenance program-a
fixed commitment.
(2) That proportion of the planned new
construction programme approved by
the government for the year.
(3) The planning of further new construction and maintenance requirements.
The voting of funds in bulk allotments by
parliament represents the direct control
exercised by the people of Canada on the
country's military activity. Funds so voted
are controlled to varying degrees depending
on the amount and nature of the expenditure.
In all cases, the treasury officer, who is
appointed by the Department of Finance to
work within the Department of National
Defence, must certify that the necessary
money is available and that the expenditure
is in fact in accordance with the purpose
for which the funds were voted.
In addition, an "administrative" approval
of the expenditure is necessary to ensure
that the expenditure is in accordance with
current government and National Defence
policies, is economical, and is made in
accordance with sound and fair business
practices. With the department, such approvals can only be given by the minister and
by the deputy and his staff, together with
senior army officers who have been specifically delegated by the minister. The
expenditure of public funds for construction
purposes is further controlled by regulations
requiring that large projects be screened by
the Department of Defence Production and
the treasury board to ascertain their effect
on the current labour and material situation
in the locality in Canada in which they are
required. This special review is intended to
prevent avoidable interference with the
general economy of the country.
It is the policy at all levels to avoid using
"direct to trade" purchasing powers, except
where essential, to maintain the excellent
relations which have been established with
the Department of Defence Production and
to use that agency as the normal purchasing
channel. It is a further policy to use the
contract method for construction and maintenance wherever possible and consistent with
true economy and efficiency. In the normal
course of events, all major new construction
projects are let by contract. Exceptions are

an officer may find in his rise up. the
ladder that he is faced with successively greater administrative Jobs for
which he is ill-suited.
This situation has a parallel in civilian
life in that the most important ability of the
head of a small business is technical 'ability.
As the size of the business increases, the
importance of managerial ability increases
and that of technical ability declines. In
medium-sized businesses, the two tend to be
of equal importance. The most important
quality in the heads of a large organization
is managerial ability, and, the larger the
concern, the more important this becomes.

Limiting Factors
The capacity of the army works services
to perform its tasks is hampered by(1) Inability to obtain staff (civilian as
well as military).
(2) Delays in obtaining approval and in
the release of funds.
(3) Effect of government restriction in the
use of day-labour and other restrictions in the method of purchasing and
letting of contracts.

The fourth alternative is that the Department of Public Works take over army works

2. Non-utilization of R.C.E. engineers who

3. Too slow and cumbersome to meet

In assessing the possibilities of these various alternatives, short-term considerations
and long-term considerations play a part.
Precedent exists for alternative number 2 in
the United Kingdom and the United States
where army works services are largely civilian in structure. Alternatives 3 and 4 represent radically different structures and their
introduction at this stage of expansion might
create harmful confusion. It would, therefore, appear advisable to adopt alternative

the organization along lines suggested under
alternative No. 2. The introduction of civilian

chief foremen of works and estimators would
constitute a major step in this direction. Once

2. He must delegate effectively. It must
be clearcut. Each man must know his

authority, must know to whom he is
responsible and his correct relations
with those on his own level. When
he delegates, he must back up, interfering only to avert catastrophe. He
should teach by guiding them to know
and follow his policy and thoughts,
not by interference.
3. His contacts with personnel, for the
purpose of information, should be uninhibited, but he should remember the
clear lines of authority and give no
orders during his explorations.
4. The different sections of the company
should be as autonomous as the capacities of those in charge of them

Up to now the absence of an administration officer, a technical stores officer and a

Pilot Plant
In view of the urgent need to apply immediate remedial measures, it is suggested
that consideration be given to the setting-up
of one of the army works companies as an
example of the ideal to be attained. In
choosing this special company, care should
be taken to select one in a suitable area and
with as nearly a perfect layout, equipment
and facilities as is possible. The administrative arangements, as well as the operational
organization, should be most carefully set
up to provide a model company. Such a
company would be in the nature of a "pilot
plant" to which officers and other ranks from
other companies could be temporarily posted

Control over Costs
Control

ovpr rnsts is a

most important

factor in the army works services since there
is not the same direct pressure for economy
in its operations as exists in a commercial
enterprise. Systems of cost accounting have
been designed to control costs. Such systems
normally disclose extravagance, waste and
unreasonable expense trends. The army
works services has a cost system and, if
operated efficiently it would accomplish the
purpose for which it was designed. However,
it has not been operated properly nor have
the results been analysed and made use of by
army headquarters. The supervision and
control of the cost system should be delegated
to a staff officer at army headquarters.
Control over Quality of Key Personnel
A co-ordinating authority at army headquarters in the nature of a personnel manager
should head up the control over the selection
of key personnel through the army works
services.
Control over Expenditures
Control over expenditures in the army
works services is exercised through the
enforcement of a series of regulations. The
regulations are adequate but adherence to
them leaves a great deal to be desired as is
shown elsewhere in this report.

8. Reduction of time and attention of senior
officers by eliminating the deluge of
literature, correspondence, requests for
information, surveys and similar demands originating from higher commands.
Control of Over-all Performance
One of the principal reasons for freeing
senior personnel of detail is to permit them
to concentrate on the performance of the
organization as a whole. Investigation reveals
that this has been lacking in the army works
services. The fundamental reasons have been
outlined above. The auditor general, the
treasury board, the chief auditor of the department and the inspectorate of quartermaster
services all assist in providing information
useful for control. At first glance it might
seem an impressive array of auditors and
inspectors. However, their efforts are to a
great extent diluted by responsibilities in
other services and departments. It is for this
reason that a staff control agency is suggested
and also a full development of the inspection
division.

Staff Control Agency
Such specific factors of control in the army
works services require the use of a staff
agency specially designed for the purpose.

larger, and directly concerned in this respect,

AccOUNTING
The fourth major problem of the army
works services has to do with the operation
of the accounting system and related regulations.

I. Cross-charging practices to be absolutely forbidden.
J. On completion of the project or job
and the turning in of completed work
orders, these should be compared in

and any unusual variances investigated immediately by the works company officer. By inspection on site the
officer commanding works company
must check to ensure that excess
materials are being returned to stores
and taken on charge.
The recent army order with respect to
approval for work has been reviewed. It
would seem that maintenance scales are
reasonable. However, in the case of new
projects, the regulations require a project no
matter how small-for example, $10-to pass
through normal channels right up to army
headquarters. This involves administrative
work on the part of many persons and is of
doubtful value. It would seem more reasonable at present to delegate such approvals to
more appropriate levels and, if necessary,
set aside special funds at these various levels
to restrict the total amount of such projects.
For example, in respect of a specific project
the following delegation of authority might
be appropriateG.O.C. Command

However, in respect . of delegation of
authority and discretion generally, this should
await a proven responsibility on the part of
officers together with a general stepping-up
of inspection and auditing, combined with a
clear-cut policy of sanctions in the case of
irresponsibility.
Cost Accounting
The operation of the cost accounting system
cannot be considered satisfactory until irregularities such as those outlined in Appendix
"B" are stopped. We are informed that cost
reports are now being received from all works
companies and detachments. Needless to say,
this is an initial step but until the quality
of cost reports is improved results are of
restricted value.
The cost accounting system is sound and
workable and will if properly used assist in
increasing the pressure for efficiency such as
is normally experienced in civilian establishments by financial factors.

physical handling and accounting for stores.
A recent examination of the physical handling of engineer stores at Petawawa revealed
a relatively favourable situation. Specifically speaking, satisfactory attention was being
paid to the following factors:
1. Maximum utilization of existing space
by way of warehousing layout.
2. Arrangement of stores in a manner
permitting conservation of time and
manpower.
3. Conservation of supplies by avoiding
re-order of material in stock when it
cannot be located when required.
4. Segregation of surplus and "stockpiled"
stores into separate warehouses thereby
simplifying stores arrangement and
speeding up of supply operations.
As a result of a physical inventory taken
during the spring, stock record cards were
brought into agreement with a physical stocktaking. The surpluses and deficiencies revealed were as follows:

The largest deficiency related to the miscellaneous classification. A subsequent investigation revealed the cause to be a deficiency of
some 377 circular floor tents. As a result
of a special stocktaking these tents were
located in ordnance for which they had been
purchased.
A clear understanding of how surpluses and
deficiencies arise is essential. A considerable
number of surpluses and offsetting deficiencies arise out of mis-identification of stores,
that is to say, where two similar types of
stores are on charge, one type is issued but the
other is written off charge in the stock
record cards. This type of error can be eliminated to a great extent by giving each type
of store an item number corresponding to
a similar item number on the stock record
card.

DECEMBER 15, 1952
Uniform Stores Catalogue
I recommend the compilation of a uniform
stores catalogue and the handling of stores
in accordance with it as the remedy for this
situation. This will alleviate complications
now being encountered by stores personnel in
attempting to handle stores in accordance
with trade names which in many cases vary
according to the supplier.
It must not be assumed that irregularities
are measured by the difference between the
amount of surpluses and the amount of
deficiencies. Such a conclusion would only
be valid if the accounting system had been
operated in a satisfactory manner.
Also, deficiencies can arise by straight pilfering of stores and no corresponding adjustment in stock record cards. Surpluses can
arise through materials being returned to
stores and, for one reason or another, not
being taken on charge. Such stores might represent excessive issues on a given project or
materials salvaged from demolitions.

occasioned by suppliers. The handling of
receipt and issue vouchers in stores would
also have to be slightly different; receipts or
issues involving stores from several sections would require separate vouchers for
each section. These, however, are minor
matters and no particular difficulty should be
experienced in this respect.

Stock Control and Surplus Stores
The regulations governing stock control
and the handling of surplus stores are well
designed and suitable if followed meticulously. To be operated satisfactorily the
services of a skilled and experienced technical stores officer are necessary. Lack of
adherence to the regulations in regard to
surplus stores contributed in large measure
to excess inventories and duplications. This
aggravated the problems of stocktaking and
contributed to wasteful purchasing.
Army works companies do not possess the
facilities to "stockpile" stores and equipment.

problem would have been confined to those
of misuse, inefficiency and waste. A special
investigation staff scrutinizing the various
areas would have stopped a good deal of
misuse and perhaps of waste also. This fact,
together with various other findings uncovered during my investigation has led me
to a thorough study of security needs at
Petawawa and, indeed, at other similar camps
throughout Canada.
Provost Personnel
The functions of the provost corps in
central command have been as follows:
1. Apprehension of absentees and deserters
2. Train patrols
3. Investigation of break-ins and thefts
4. Traffic control and escorts for distinguished visitors, parades, etc.
5. Discipline of troops when away from
units
6. Security checks and patrols on camps
and in buildings
The lack of men and the wide area to be
covered from Ottawa to Windsor and from
Toronto to Sault Ste. Marie has made it
impossible to carry out all their duties satisfactorily. Provost corps personnel for the
most part have been employed on 1, 2, 4 and
5 above and accordingly 3 and 6 have been
neglected. The numbers of personnel now
available for duty are entirely inadequate

and even if the present establishment were
filled it would not provide sufficient
supervision.
In January of 1951 the establishment of
central command provost company was 38
all ranks. Two officers and 31 men were
posted to the company at that time. These
were distributed as follows:

was drawn

up by the

Provost corps and submitted to the secretary
of the war establishment committee of central
command, 'dated August 14, 1952. A summary of this proposed new establishment is
attached as Appendix "C".
Camp Patrols
Al provost personnel posted to 'a camp or
area are available to assist the commanding
officer in the exercise of his responsibility
for the security of that camp or area. A most
effective way of improving camp security
would be to provide sufficient provost personnel to enable mobile patrols to operate
through a camp on a 24-hour basis. They
should be thoroughly conversant with camp
activities.
Gate Guards
The employment of commissionaires serves
a useful purpose in replacing trained military
personnel.
In camps, corps of commissionaires personnel are often employed at
the camp barriers. These men can be quite
effective if they are carefully supervised and

if a proper checking procedure is set up for
them to use at the barrier.
The Guarding of Back Roads in Camps
Camp security cannot be complete as long

as back exits remain open without guards
or barriers. In large camps, such as Petawawa
and Borden it is not possible to fence the
entire area but much can be done by building suitable gates on back roads and erecting
wire or other obstacles to prevent vehicles
leaving the roads in the vicinity of the gates.
These gates or barriers should also be
guarded by the corps of commissionaires.
Relationship of Townsites and Camps
Security can be improved by segregating

policy of posting men returning from Korea
to the detachment nearest their homes.
Since the Korean situation arose a new
problem has been presented, namely, providing security for the vast quanti.ties of
valuable and attractive stores which have
been accumulated.
After consultation, a proposal for another

The uneven distribution of personnel to
detachments was due in part to the present

movement of personnel in and out of the
camp from the townsite. Fences should be
constructed segregating the townsite from
camps. Visitors, taxis, tradesmen and so
forth entering the townsite would not then
have to pass through military gates. Otherwise an easy means of access to camps is
available and this should not be so.

DECEMBER 15, 1952
Use of R.C.M.P. Personnel
It is recommended that a constable of the
R.C.M.P. be posted for duty in each major
camp to represent the civilian authority. In
almost every camp there are large numbers
of civilians employed and these are in addition to those living in married quarters. It
has not been found acceptable or satisfactory
for members of the provost corps to take
care of situations involving civilians. It is
of great importance, however, that there be
a clear definition and understanding of the
authority of the provost corps, the R.C.M.P.
and the provincial and municipal police.
Special Investigation Staff
It is recommended that a special investigation unit be organized as part of the Canadian provost corps for employment in checking up on security measures generally and,
in particular, to be available at short notice
to carry out special investigations when
situations arise such as did at Petawawa. The
members of this unit should be trained as
experts in making this type of enquiry and
in collecting evidence.
It is important that the provost corps be
brought in at the early stages of known
irregularities or major losses. There has been
evidence that this has not been done in all
cases.
Burglar Alarm Systems
Burglar alarm systems would not appear
appropriate for the engineer compound at
Petawawa but there are other locations in
the camp where they would be useful, e.g.,
ordnance stores. Also, medical stores at certain
locations would appear to warrant installation
of such systems.
Gate Passes
Al military stores and equipment being
moved out of the camp area should be accompanied by a document of identification
authorizing the removal thereof. This document will be collected by the guard at the
gate for subsequent scrutiny by the provost
corps.
Provision should be made for the examination of all civilian vehicles leaving the camp
to ensure that government property is not
being removed.
Use of Police Radio Equipment
Modern two-way police radio equipment
has been in operation in the Toronto Detachment of central command provost company
for a number of months. This equipment
has proved very useful and has done much
to overcome the shortage of personnel. Similar
equipment should be made available to all

In most

cases it is preferable for equipment to be
tied in on the civil police net.
The present practice of posting provost personnel to units would appear to be inadvisable
since supervision and control over such personnel by provost corps is to a large extent
lost. In view of the difficulties in acquiring
sufficient personnel for the functions outlined
above, it would appear more appropriate to
use these personnel to fill the establishment.
PART IV-CONCLUSION AND REcOMMENDATIONS

My report, I fully recognize, contains many
discouraging features. The over-all situation
is, however, by no means discouraging
because of the fact that the cure for what
has gone wrong in the past vcan be and, in
fact, is being applied.
As an example of what can be and actually
has been done to remedy conditions quickly,
it is interesting to follow the action which
was taken at Halifax immediately following
my inspection early in September. I reported
verbally to national defence headquarters
that conditions at Halifax were not satisfactory. As had been found at other establishments, stores, accounting and administrative
procedures had broken down seriously. Senior
officers were immediately dispatched from
Ottawa to look into the situation. They took
remedial action at once. Certain key personnel were replaced; others were put on notice;
temporary stores and clerical staff together
with a labour force were engaged to clean
up the situation and bring the accounting
records up-to-date.
In November, I was invited to return to
Halifax to examine the results of the vigorous
action which had been taken. I found that
remarkable changes had been made. The
company had been completely re-organized.
The stores had been re-catalogued and rearranged. Accounting records and stores
procedure had been revised and corrected.
As a result of what had been done the unit
had been placed in a position to function
properly and to carry on with normal efficiency.
In conclusion, I am giving you hereunder
my recommendations covering the operations
of the army works services. Some of these
have been already explained; others of a more
technical character will be self-explanatory.
RECOMMENDATIONS

Organization and Control
1. The new organization set up for the
service at army headquarters should be filled

SENATE
as quickly as possible and selection of personnel for key posts should reflect the paramount
importance of its managerial function.
2. Creation of a staff agency is needed at
army headquarters to supervise the enforcement of established policies; to control organization; costs; methods and man-power and
over-all performance. Publication and inspection divisions of the organization should be
under its direct control.
3. Creation of administration service teams
in the inspection division is required.
4. Effective action on the reports of the
chief auditor is essential.
5. More frequent inspections and audits are
necessary.
6. Evidence of wasteful and unauthorized
expenditures should be promptly and thoroughly investigated and sanctions applied
against offending personnel as warranted.
7. Top personnel must free themselves of
as much detail as possible to supervise more
effectively the enforcement of established
policies. They should lay greater stress on
their administrative functions and ensure by
personal visits to lower echelon that prompt
action is taken to rectify unsatisfactory conditions.
8. Periodic meetings of officers commanding
works companies and detachments should be
held at command headquarters.
9. Basic principles of management must be
adhered to by all officers commanding works
companies and detachments.
10. Each works company or large detachment requires the following key civilian personnel:
(a) An administrative officer
(b) A chief foreman of works
(c) A technical stores officer
(d) A skilled chief estimator.

16. All payments owing to the crown must
be made to the receiver general. Al ranks
shouid be pruil>ited fïrom accepting cither
cash or cheques or money orders made payable to themselves or to their office.
Accounting
17. The quality of cost estimating needs
improvement to make the system effective.
18. Emphasis is required on the need for
accurate distribution of costs. Otherwise
data become meaningless and control over
unauthorized expenditures difficult.
19. Work order forms and related procedures require revision.
20. A system of work approvals incorporating tentative or preliminary estimates
should be installed.
21. Rigid enforcement of the procedures
covering approval of projects is needed. Disciplinary action should follow where deliberate intent to circumvent regulations is
evident.
22. The existing regulations relating to the
approval of projects require modification to
provide more delegation of authority with
respect to minor new construction projects.
23. Rental of equipment to civilians
requires control, and rates and procedure
defined.
24. Real property records must be brought
up-to-date as quickly as possible as these
records are fundamental to the effective use
of the accounting system.

Stores
25. A uniform stores catalogue is highly
desirable.
26. Monthly inventory counts, as required
by regulations, must not be neglected.
27. Suitable stores controlling accounts
should be incorporated into the general
ledger.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE

ADDRESS IN REPLY
The Senate resumed from Wednesday,
December 10, consideration of His Excellency
the Governor General's Speech at the opening of the session, and the motion of Hon.
Mr. Vaillancourt for an address in reply
thereto.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
it is not my habit to take part in this debate
every session, but on this occasion I feel
bound to make a few remarks about certain
things affecting my own province and
Canada in general.
First, I should like to congratulate the
mover and the seconder (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt and Hon. Mr. Hawkins) of the Address
in reply to the Speech from the Throne. I
was particularly pleased with many of the
sentiments expressed by the mover, particularly those relating to co-operatives. He
is undoubtedly interested in farm .co-operatives, credit unions, and so on, which represent a measure of self-help with which I am
in entire agreement. I was very glad that
the leader of the government stated that he
knew I would not talk politics. That is quite
correct. I would not think of talking politics.
My object is to say something that will
benefit Canada generally, and of course it

cannot be helped if something that I say
affects one party or another.
Let me remind the house again that we aie

uncertainties in the future. My criticism of

so far is that they have not made one proposal 'for the benefit of this country or suggested how we can avoid some of the dangers
that lie ahead. One matter that affects the
whole of Canada very seriously is the question of freight rates, and it is of particular
importance to my province. The freight rate
on horses, for instance, has almost doubled in
the last few years. Then, as I have suggested
before, the whole question of the regulation of
trucks-highway transportation-is one that
perhaps a Senate committee should endeavour
to solve. The western provinces are simply
not able to build highways strong enough to
bear the enormous loads that are carried on
big modern trucks. Anyway, every day we
see proof that motor transport is no substitute for the railways. Just the other evening I was driving from the country over
a perfectly good paved road that happened to
have a bit of snow and ice on it. Well, three
cars had skidded and entirely blocked the
highway. No system of highway transport
that has yet been invented can successfully
compete with the railways in the hauling of
heavy loads.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Certainly we are not making anything like the use that we should of
our railways. Huge highways which accommodatè large motor trucks parallel our railways for long distances, yet we sit here and
make no attempt to solve the problem. I
think that a good deal of the truck traffic is
interprovincial, and it seems to me that a government that is really working in the interests
of the people would see to it that parliament
made a serious endeavour to bring about
some change that would make further increases in freight rates unnecessary. There
is other useful employment for the trucks
that are now depriving the railways of revenue; and in the development of this country,
which suffers from so serious a lack of manpower, there is other useful employment for
the men now engaged in the trucking business.
Another question which no speaker has so
far touched upon is immigration. All our
financiers and other men who have studied
world conditions realize that it is of paramount importance that we allow the proper
type of immigrants into this country and
find employment for them in the development of our huge natural resources. That is
the one sure way of building up a market
for our primary products.

DECEMBER 16. 1952
Look at world conditions today! I do not
know how other senators felt about it when
they read in the newspapers last year of
all the people--thousands of them-who were
escaping from east Germany into west Germany, until the west German authorities
threw up their hands and asked these people
to stay where they were, even though it
meant continuing to endure torture. To me
this was a terrifying thing. There was not
a word from our government by way of
offering homes to these people. I myself have
two or three vacant houses on farms, and
there are many thousands of such houses
throughout the country. But no attempt was
made to relieve the condition of these unfortunates, who were living ten or twelve to
a room until the congestion became so bad
that the people of west Germany had to ask
them to remain under the iron fist.
I accuse the government-and my remarks
are not particularly directed at the present
Prime Minister-of having as its main purpose the maintaining of itself in power. Some
of us may be accused of playing a little politics, but in this instance politics do not
matter. I repeat, the chief object of the
government is to keep itself in power, and
I commend the honourable senator from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid), whose speech
I enjoyed, for having intimated as much
in his remarks.
The honourable senator from Calgary (Hon.
Mr. Ross), in the speech he read us the other
day, gave us some information that was
entirely different from what I believed to be
the facts. Now I -am completely confused.
W'hat 'his remarks had to do with the Indian
Act or the address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne, I do not know. Certainly,
anybody who knows anything about surveying knows that the Indians were not interested in the river lots. In a municipality in
which I had the honour to be reeve for a
long time, we had a group of adjoining river
lots, all in different sections.
We have heard much in this and in the
other house about security and prosperity.
The two western provinces of Alberta and
Saskatchewan are enjoying unlimited prosperity at the present time. If in Saskatchewan we seil our present crop, as we hope to
do, that province will probably be wealthier
per capita than any other province in the
dominion. Yet at one time we heard in the
other chamber a warning against investing a
dollar in Saskatchewan. Today -the bonds of
the two provinces I have referred to stand
higher than federal bonds.
For my part, I believe that Canada is
prosperous in spite of its government. About
68112-11

the only constructive move made by the federal authorities in a long time was the creation of the central bank; and as a consequence
the late Viscount Bennett lost the support of
the banks, who feared that the establishment
of a central would deprive them of some of
their revenues. I recall also that Viscount
Bennett endeavoured to put through an
unemployment insurance measure, but was
met with the argument by certain lawyers
that it was unconstitutional for him to do so.
Later, when the matter was referred to the
legal advisers of the Crown, they held that it
was constitutional, and ruled in favour of the
legislation. However the matter went to the
Supreme Court, where it was held up; otherwise unemployment insurance might have
been put into effect a year or two earlier than
it was.
Something
which
happened
recently
entitles me, I think, to poke a little fun at
the supporters of the government.
We
remember a time when they were closely
associated with a certain man from Toronto
who recently appeared before one of our
committees. During an election in North
Grey he announced that he was supporting
the Liberal party, and that there was cooperation between him and them;. so I
think perhaps he was right-in fact, well
justified-in addressing them the other day
as "comrades".
On the question of an international wheat
agreement, speaking on behalf of the producers of our province, I can say that they
hope the government will do its best to secure
another agreement. Indications are that there
will be more rather than less inflation, so it
would be very desirable to insert a clause to
safeguard the producers' rights in the matter
of their returns, because changing values
have already cost them a considerable amount
of money. t is true that if one visits the
United States and offers Canadian currency, and gets a premium on it, one's vanity
is fiattered, but in many lines of business the
disparity between the two currencies ls
causing us loss rather than gain. For instance,
when we sell our wheat, payment in United
States currency reduces the price several
cents per bushel.
It cannot be too often repeated that the
'price quoted to easterners for western Canadian wheat, basis Fort William, des not reflect the situation in so far as Saskatchewan
or indeed Western Canada in general, is
concerned. On the American side of the line,
opposite North Portal, Saskatchewan, wheat
for which we in Saskatchewan receive $1.23
per bushel-true, that is only the initial payment-is sold for $2.12j. The price of wheat
at Montreal, on November 18, 1952, was $2.05
per bushel.

SENATE
In the old days wheat farming was generyrecQgni7Prl s a gamble. The farmer still
gambles to this extent, that in feeding and
summer-fallowing his land he is taking the
risk of frost, drouth, hail, and other troubles.
Nowadays, to a large extent, the government
are doing the gambling for him; and the fact
that they are gambling is apparent enough.
At the moment conditions favour them, because drouth has affected large areas in the
United States where the bulk of American
winter wheat is grown, and I doubt whether
even the recent rains will enable the growers
there to harvest a normal crop. But these
conditions are not likely to be repeated. I
believe we shall be fortunate next year if
we reap two-thirds as much as the present
year's crop; indeed, the yield may fall to
one-half, because at the present time the
prairies are dry. To this extent, I would
point out, the government are gambling.
We were very well pleased with the
returns on our low-grade wheat; as a matter
of fact the final payment was higher by four
or five cents than that on the milling grades.
Some complaint has been heard that our
better wheat was held for too high a price.
About 100 million bushels, chiefly low-grade
wheat from the 1950-51 crop, have not yet
been idisposed of, although the final payment
has been made. The element of gambling
here lies in the fact that about 100 million
bushels of this low-grade wheat is being
transferred to the 1952-53 accumulation, and
the board hopes to dispose of it along with
all the other crop. In the meanwhile the fact
that this wheat is in store has compelled us
to pile great quantities of wheat out in the
fields, and it is very difficult to move it.
Churchill is our nearest and best port. I
made my first trip there this year. Two ships
came in the -day I arrived, and another while
I was there, and on the 28th or 29th of July
I met some of the captains. One ship brought
in some heavy machinery, probably for electrical plants, but another-a huge vessel carried nothing but water ballast. Churchill is
a fine port, with a shed capable of holding
any amount of material, and as well built and
equipped as any I have seen.
One of the ships to whose captain I was
talking had come through ice. During the
two days I was there, a north-east wind blew
continuously, and although no ice was visible
out in the open, there was some floe ice in
near the shore. The captain told me he
thought he could go around or through it.
He complained, however, that one of the first
ships to visit the port was held up and that
the N. B. MacLean, the government ship, was
merely servicing various stations in the

straits, but did nothing to facilitate the movements of ships through the ice floes. Also it
was represented to me that, ii an ocean-guing
tug or ice-breaker were stationed at the port,
the inbound trip could be made a couple of
weeks earlier, but that the government boat
was fit only to patrol the mouth of the Churchill river, and not an ocean-going tug at all.
My informant, a captain, also said: "If we
could be assured of having wheat available
for shipment, we could have ten ships here."
I believe that the past season has seen a
record number of bushels shipped through
Churchill,-some 8,000,000 bushels. To my
mind this is much nearer the minimum than
the possible maximum. In fact, I have the
impression that there is a direct movement
to hinder shipping. One vessel, after going
all the way to Churchill, came back to Montreal to load because of some change in
arrangements with respect to the billing or
the shipping order.
This great shed that I speak of could hold
a million bushels of wheat, but when I saw
it, cement that had come in by the Dalgleish
Line was all that it contained. I was walking
through the shed with a farmer, and I asked
what had been kept in it during the wintertime. He replied "Nothing but that cement".
It had lain there all winter while many
building contracts had been held up simply
because of the lack of cement. During the
supposed shortage contractors had been
forced to pay as high as $3 a bag for cement,
and when I asked why this cement had not
been moved out I was told that it would cost
too much to ship it to Regina. I said, "That's
ridiculous. It is only 700 miles to Regina and
cement has been shipped thousands of miles".
I found out later that the cement had been
ordered by a company working on a defence
project for the government, and that the
people who had sold the cement had been
asked to take it back.
I know that the Swedes have loaded their
vessels with cement. I happened to meet a
young fellow from Sweden who had brought
his house into Churchill in sections. It was
a prefabricated house, ready to be put
together on arrival from Sweden, where it
had been made. This young man told me he
had endeavoured to sell a whole shipload of
cement. He had gone to Winnipeg to see the
officials of the Canadian National Railways.
He was ready to pay $750 a carload to ship
cement from Churchill to Winnipeg, but the
Canadian National Railways demanded $810,
a difference of $60. He complained bitterly
about this, and I told him that perhaps there
was a cement plant close to one of the C.N.R.
lines and that it might have been said, "If you

DECEMBER 16, 1952
carry cement at that rate we will not ship
any more with you". I told him that there
might be some difficulty as to that.
We hear a great deal of talk about trade,
and the fact that we must have trade if we
are going to sell our goods. Surely we could
bring in many kinds of goods through
Churchill, and at the same time, with no
difficulty at all, ship out 40 million bushels
of wheat. One capitain told me that he could
have ten ships ready, but he said "Where
will we get the wheat from?" I maintain
that what we need is another four or five
terminal elevators to store our wheat, and
that a greater effort should be made to have
freight cars ready to transport wheat during
the shipping season. Is it any wonder that
I am suspicious about the lack of effort to
use the port at Churchill? I well remember
the time when it was said that Vancouver
could not handle wheat. We were told that
wheat could never be shipped through the
Panama Canal because it would spoil, and it
was argued that the port of Vancouver did
not have the facilities to handle wheat and
so on. Well, Vancouver is shipping a great
quantity of wheat at the present time, and
this is proving extremely beneficial to Saskatchewan and Alberta.
Then there is the question of beef. We
have heard a great deal about the government supporting prices. I have never seen
greater confusion in anything than there is
in the way sales are made in the stock yards.
A small percentage of beef is sold at 24 or
25 cents a pound; this is government supported; but the great bulk of beef sells at
15 cents a pound. I have bought beef at 12j
cents a pound for our own use, and it was
splendid meat. The cost of living affects
everybody, and it is strange that when beef
was at its highest price on the market a
working man could get a meal of beef for
about half the price he has to pay today.
The last time I travelled on the Canadian
National Railways they had no beef on
the menu. The head steward persuaded me
to have some trout. He said it was wonderful. Well, I may tell you that I very nearly
did not return to this chamber. I said to
him the next time I saw him, "The dogs
should have had that trout".
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I would urge the beef
raisers in Western Canada to get busy on
a campaign of "Eat more beef". They should
point out the prices at which the retailers
should be able to sell it. Beef is one of the
cheapest and best foods any man can eat.
If a proper campaign were carried on there
would be scarcely any surplus of beef at
68112-111

all. The fishing interests of this country
have done well in encouraging people to
eat fish, but personally I think the only place
to eat fish is right beside the water, as soon
as you catch them.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Horner: There is one statement
made in this debate by the honourable senator
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) with
which I did not quite agree. He said people
are killing themselves by eating too much.
Well, there is a certain class of idle men who
may be killing themselves by eating, but that
is not true of the working men. I have had
some experience. When I bought my farm it
was half bush, and we did not have bulldozers to clear land in those days. When I
hired men to help me I would watch to see
how well they could eat, and if they could
not eat well I knew they would not last long
at their job.
Now I want to say something about social
security. If a man goes to jail he can have
plenty of social security. But that is not
what we want. That is not what has made
this country. A life of ease or pleasure
does not make great men; it is a life of
struggle. I think I was the only man in this
chamber to get up and object when the baby
bonus legislation was introduced.
I still think that was a vicious political
move. And what has it accomplished? Has it
done away with juvenile crime? Never in the
history of the country were more young
people going astray.
Now we have old age pensions for everyone. We disregard the great old preaching,
"Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy
days may be long upon the land". The modern
practice is to put them out on pension when
they reach seventy years of age. What a
change from the days of the early settlers!
And these schemes do not depend upon
whether we can afford them or not. The fact
is that once you start something of this kind
you cannot stop there. It never gets smaller,
but grows, and then the people cry for other
things of the same kind. Right now, for
instance, there is a cry for larger bonuses
and increased pensions.
The latest demand is for a national health
insurance scheme. Well, if there had been
such a scheme in effect when I was young I
might not have been here today. Perhaps I
may be allowed to tell this personal story.
My first winter away from home and a large
family was spent at a lumber camp in northern Saskatchewan, not far from Le Pas. The
men were driving a river that had never been
driven before. It was a very late spring, and

move.
The bills were read the third time, and
passed, on division.
It being six o'clock, the Senate took recess.
At eight o'clock the sitting was resumed.
CRIMINAL CODE BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Salier A. Hayden presented the report
of the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce on Bill O, an Act respecting the
criminal law.

DECEMBER 16, 1952
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant
as follows:
The Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, to whom was referred Bill O, an Act
respecting the criminal law, have in obedience to
the order cf reference of November 25, 1952,
examined the said bill and now beg leave to report
the same with the following amendments: ...

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Dispense.
(See Appendix at end of today's report.)
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into
consideration?
Hon. Mr. Hayden, with leave, moved concurrence in the report.
He said: Honourable senators, in view of
the importance of the bill which has just
been reported to the Senate I thought it
might be well to say a few words on what
may be regarded as some of the highlights
in the committee's consideration of this
measure. I can say that it is with a certain
sense of satisfaction, and also with a great
sense of relief, that I see the bill now
reported.
During the progress of our study of the
bill this fall it became necessary to set up a
sub-committee, just as we did last spring,
when we considered in the sub-committee
possibly less than a third of the sections in
the bill. What we did then has facilitated
our work at this session. Nevertheless, since
-the session began the sub-committee has sat
on fifteen days, on most of which the meetings began in the morning and extended over
the afternoon and evening. That was the
only practical way in which a job of this size
could be done, for if the continuity of consideration had not been preserved a good
deal of time would have been wasted in
warming up to the task.
The sub-committee recommended more
than one hundred amendments to various
parts of the bill. These were in addition to
the amendmen-ts suggested by the sub-committee last spring, many of which were
incorporated into the bill before it was
reintroduced into the Senate at this session.
Last spring and again this fall representations were received from various organizations protesting against enactments in a very
general sort of way. Three organizations filed
briefs. They also requested an opportunity
to present to the main committee an oral
submission in support of their briefs, and
that is the reason why they appeared there
last Thursday. Their presentations had ta do
mainly with the treason sections and certain
sections relating to obstruction in the operation of a plant, which constitutes the offence

of creating mischief. In the main their objections did not relate to offences being newly
provided against in this bill, but to some
that had been covered by the Criminal Code
for a very long time. I think they did, however, object to some provisions that were
added somewhat more recently to the section
defining treason, which is section 46 in the
bill.
In addition we received representations on
behalf of those who were interested in providing by some amendment to the Code for
the right to conduct what is commonly called
dog racing, with pari mutuel betting. Now,
notwithstanding the receipt of those representations by the main committee, no member
of the committee saw fit to submit any amendments in line with them. And as to the
treason sections and others which were
objected to by the organizations that I mentioned, the committee is recommending no
amendments which by any stretch of the
imagination can be said to arise from the
submissions made to the committee by those
organizations last Thursday. Further, the
sub-committee's report was prepared before
the main committee heard those organizations.
Possibly I should refer to one or two of
the committee's amendments which embody
some important changes in the law. I think
the committee's most notable amendment is
one to provide for an appeal from conviction
for contempt of court, whether the contempt
is committed in the face of the court-that
is, before the judge or magistrate-or as the
result of some act or publication done outside the court. This provision for an appeal
is something new and unusual, but it was
the unanimous view of the committee that
there should be some provision for an appeal
as a salutary check on any improper exercise of authority in the circumstances. The
appeal provision which was finally decided
upon and incorporated in the bill makes it
possible to appeal from sentence only, in
cases where the contempt takes place in the
face of the court-that is, before the judge
or magistrate who finds the person guilty of
contempt and imposes the penalty. But for
cases in which the contempt takes place outside the court we provided an appeal from
both the conviction and the sentence, so that
either the conviction or the sentence or both
may be reviewed by a higher court, depending upon the course of action that the convicted person decides to take. I think that
is a notable advance in the law as it relates
to contempt.
Another notable advance is that for the
first time in our criminal law any and all
offences for which a person may be charged
and tried are contained within one piece of
legislation, and as and when the measure

SENATE

now before us is enacted by parliament, it
will become the criminal law of Canada. No

substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice
in a case, and dismiss the appeal, notwith-

longer will any person be charged wiih wiat

standing the fact that the roirt may also

are called common law offences. Unless those
offences have been incorporated into the
criminal law-that is, into the particular bill
now before us-they no longer exist in the
realm of the criminal law of Canada.
There are several other matters which
1 should briefly mention to the house. Despite
some protest by the departmental officials,
we retained what is called "trial de novo"the right to have a new trial and to have the
witnesses heard again. Provision for a new
trial exists in our present law, and relates
to appeals from summary convictions. As the
law now stands an accused person who has
been convicted may appeal or, in case of an
acquittal, the Crown may appeal. The matter
then is taken to an appeal judge, who may
hear the case de novo, or by agreement of
the parties he may hear arguments, by both
the appellant and the respondent, on the
record of the evidence taken at the original
trial. That requires, as I say, the consent of
both parties.
It seemed to us that the provision for trial
le novo was a salutary check on any mistakes that might occur in the trial of first
instance, where the lists are so heavy. Very
often an accused person does not realize the
predicament he is in until a magistrate convicts him and sentences him to a fine or
imprisonment, or both. If the accused is
not represented by a lawyer-and very often
in the court of first instance he is not-he has
no appreciation of the weight of evidence
against him, and he does not have the ability
to cross-examine the Crown's witnesses in
such a way as best to bring out the points in
his favour. The common result is that he
allows the record to consist of the Crown's
case and nothing else in the way of an effective rebuttal of what the Crown has said;
yet when the circumstances have been fully
considered they may show that he has a perfectly good defence; and if he is granted a
new trial he may, with the aid of counsel,
provide the necessary evidence to gain an
acquittal. In my opinion, that is sufficient
to justify the continuation in the Code of the
provision for trial de novo. There has been
a substantial expression of opinion by judges
and magistrates in various parts of the country in favour of its continuance. We felt,
therefore, that we were not flying in the face
of public opinion in maintaining this salutary provision.
May I say something about an appeal to
the appellate court by a person who has been
convicted of an indictable offence? Our law
has for a long time provided that a court
of appeal may find that there has been no

conclude that the verdict was unreasonable,
having regard to the weight of evidence, or
that there has been a miscarriage of justice
or some wrong decision on the question of
law. It seems illogical and lacking in good
sense to give to the court the power to say,
on the one hand, that the verdict is unreasonable and against the weight of evidence, and
on the other hand that there has been no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.
That seemed to us an anomolous situation,
and by our amendment to this bill we have
terminated it. We felt that there should be
no weighing of degrees of miscarriage of
justice. If in the opinion of the appellate
court there has been a miscarriage, that
court should not be given power to weigh the
miscarriage against some intangible thing and
decide whether there has been a substantial
wrong or miscarriage of justice. In our view
a miscarriage of justice amounts to a denial
of justice, and the accused is entitled to have
his appeal allowed.
In our amendment to the bill we have confined the application of the rule by which
the court of appeal could dismiss an appeal
on the ground that there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice to
the case where there has been a wrong
decision on the question of law. In those
circumstances the court may examine all the
facts of the case and decide that the wrong
decision on a question of law was not important in the decision of the case, or that the
jury was not influenced against the accused,
or that the scheme of his defence was lot
affected adversely. In those circumstances it
may well be found that notwithstanding the
wrong decision in law there has been no substantial miscarriage of justice, and therefore
the appeal will be dismissed. In that regard,
we have made the amendment which I have
indicated.
We also dealt with the right of election by
an accused person. The provisions of the
Criminal Code are quite firm in relation te
offences and matters of proof. The bill
before you provides certain rights of election
by an accused as to how he shall be tried.
In that respect the bill is a departure from
the present law, which allows an accused te
elect to be tried summarily or by the next
court of competent jurisdiction-which means
by a judge and jury-and having made the
latter choice, he can later re-elect to be tried
by a judge without a jury. The bill as it
came to us provided that if an accused elected
before a magistrate to be tried by a judge
without a jury, he would not have a chanceif he were later advised by counsel that he

DECEMBER 16, 1952
would be better off before a jury-to re-elect
to be tried by judge and jury. We felt that
the new law should not put an accused in
any worse position, and that at the same time
we should protect the Crown by providing
that an accused could re-elect only up to the
fixing of the time for his trial. Once the
day of his trial bas been fixed he could not
dilly-dally any longer with the court and the
procedure of the court. Thereafter be could
not make re-election for trial by judge and
jury without the consent of the Attorney
General or counsel representing the Attorney General. So we have provided that safeguard; and the Crown, by simply fixing, at
as early a day as possible, the date of his
trial, bas within its own hands the means
to reduce the time within which a convicted
person may avail himself of this right to
re-elect. After that it becomes necessary to
obtain the consent of the Attorney General
or counsel on his behalf.
Hon. Mr. Ross: Does that right of the
accused to make election apply in all cases?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Well, of course there are
some cases in which the magistrate has
absolute jurisdiction. I refer to cases where
there is the right of election. Where the
magistrate bas absolute jurisdiction he just
presides and tries the case. In summary
conviction cases he presides and tries the
case, and then the defendant has the right
of appeal. I am speaking about cases where
an accused person with his consent, that is by
his election, can be tried before the magistrate, or he may make these other elections.
There are one or two other things to which
I should call your attention. I think we have
improved very considerably the proceedings
in respect of estreat in the case of recognizance. Where sureties have entered into a
recognizance assuring the appearance of an
accused person at the proper time and place,
and have furnished the necessary security,
we have simplified the procedure in the
event of default or the securiýty not being
sufficient to take care of the amount of the
recognizance which was originally put up
to secure the appearance of the accused person. It was provided in the bill that when
the sheriff had exhausted his remedies as
regards collecting the amount of the recognizance and was still short of the full amount,
the next step would be an ex parte proceeding by the Crown for the committal of the
surety to jail, and after such committal
there was provision whereby, upon notice,
the surety could make application to be heard
by a judge as to why he should not have to
remain in jail. That procedure presented
many complications. It might turn out that
the circumstances were such that the surety
68112-12

should not have been committed 'to jail at all.
So we thought a simple method of dealing
with the matter would be to substitute, for
the ex parte hearing, a notice to the surety,
who then would make out his case, if he
could, and account for the circumstances
which led to the lack of realization out of the
assets which were put up on the recognizance.
There are many situations where the surety
might be blameless for the situation which
subsequently developed. For instance, he
might put up securities the market value of
which, at the time of putting up, would be at
least equal to the amount of the recognizance,
but which subsequently., when default
occurred and -there was an attempt to realize,
might by reason of factors beyond his control
have dropped to such an extent that they
amounted to less -than the sum required. In
those circumstances it would be unreasonable
to penalize the surety by putting him in jail,
since he had acted in perfect good faith. That
is the reason we made the change. We thought
it was in the interest of the protection of the
surety, and it was not against the interest of
the Crown.
I should direct your attention to the fact
that we did one thing which may be said to
make us leaders in this particular direction;
we struck out in committee today the section,
which heretofore was also part of the common law, that makes it an offence to libel the
Speaking
sovereign of a foreign state.
frankly, we were moved to do that, I believe,
by a realistic appraisal of the present world
situation. It did not appeal to us that this
section should continue to operate as a restraint on freedom of criticism or critical
expression in relation to persons who may
temporarily be in the position of, or designated as, sovereign heads of foreign states, or
that the measure of an alleged libel should
be how it was regarded in those countries.
Having given the matter consideration, we felt
that provisions which may not have been
inappropriate in earlier times-when more
regard was had for the position and the
dignity of heads of sovereign states, and international relationships were on a somewhat
different plane-had become more or less
outmoded, if not archaic. It was our opinion
that this provision added nothing to the
comity of nations; that its exclusion from the
present bill would be neither remarked nor
regretted; and that therefore we were justified in striking it out.
These are some of the principal things we
considered; and tonight I am touching only
on the main sections. A number of others
were amended merely for the purpose of
clarification. We did not read into the drafting of the sections any intent to deprive an
accused person of all the rights and pro-

SENATE
cedures and defences which have availed him
hitherto, but we felt that something more
coult be done to make plain whaL Llwbe
rights were in particular cases.
I think it will be evident to you when you
read the report that we scrutinized minutely,
line by line, even down to periods and
commas, every section of the bill; and it contains over 280 pages, 748 sections and quite
a number of forms. In our task we received
excellent assistance from our Law Clerk, who
demonstrated once again the .ability in these
matters of which he has given us so freely.
He was present at all our hearings and worked
on the drafting of all the amendments. We are
also indebted to the law officers of the Department of Justice who sat with us, and did an
excellent job, and to whom we have referred
particularly in the report.
Honourable senators, we have got to
remember that the legislation before us is
a revision of the Criminal Code and not a
revision of the substantive criminal law of
Canada. It is true that a considerable reduction has been made in the content of the
Code, some 1,200 sections having been
reduced to approximately 748. Many of the
archaical offences have been stricken from
the Code. As the Code has grown up many
condensed and simpler ways have been found
to express things that previously required
much more space. In its general over-all
scheme the Code is therefore a more simplifled document today. In particular, the procedural sections have been streamlined and
are much easier to follow and understand.
The processes are logical and reasonable, and
can be grasped readily. The Code is in a
highly commendable state, but I would warn
at the same time that a revision of our substantive criminal law has not been made.
When offences contained in the legislation
before the bouse require overhauling as a
result of changing conditions, some special
group may have to be commissioned to deal
with the matter. We must remember that as
a result of social development and changing
conditions, acts that are not offences now
may have to be written into the Code as
offences in the future. These are matters
which may very well become the subject of
thorough study at some future time. Our
committee felt that it should not bring in
new offences under a heading or description
of offences which have acquired a secondary
meaning. For instance, under the word
"treason" we think of particular kinds of
offences. We did not think it wise to bring
in new and modern offences, which are the
outgrowth of present world conditions, and
group them under the word "treason", which

has acquired its own peculiar significance.
We felt that, if changing times require it,
we sail lave tu c
ne;;- criminal offences
and provide adequate punishment for them.
That is why in the treason section we deleted
a subsection. It may be that in the light of
present-day conditions that there should be
such an offence and that the offender should
be punished wi'th the full rigour of the law.
But let us call it what it is, and make it a
criminal offence. After all, criminal law is
not static and must progress as the public
need requires. Let us create new offences
where necessary, but let us not put them
under headings which are misleading. These
titles may have acquired restricted and qualified meanings over the years. That is what
we thought about the word treason. I do
not bow to anybody in my desire -to protect
the welfare and the public interest of Canada
against those, either within or without this
country, who would seek to undermine the
public safety and welfare of Canada. In
creating new offences with rigorous penalties,
we should make sure that Canada can punish
to the full extent of her criminal law those
who might attempt to undermine her security
when they are enjoying the protection,
hospitality, comfort, safety and well-being
that this country affords.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Davies: May I ask the honourable
senator a question? I was present at the
hearings of the main committee, and perhaps
I should know more about this subject; but
it is not clear in my mind what the Criminal
Code has to do with dog racing. My understanding is that certain legislation would have
to be passed by the federal parliament or
a provincial legislature before a person could
start dog racing in any province. What
exactly has the Criminal Code got to do with
dog racing? I am sorry to be so ignorant on
the point.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The answer is simple.
If you are talking only about the running
of dogs, the Criminal Code has absolutely
nothing to do with that. If, however, you
wish to have pari mutuel betting in connection with the running of dog races, then the
Criminal Code will have everything to do
with it. At the present time the Code makes
it a criminal offence to bet on dog races; it
does not exempt dog races as it does horse
races, from the general provision of the
Criminal Code with respect to betting.
Therefore, while you could have dog races
without any regard to the Criminal Code
at all, you could not have dog racing with
pari mutuel betting. I do not know to what I
could compare dog racing without pari mutuel

DECEMBER 16, 1952
betting. It would be like spending money and
not having any money to spend. Dog racing
without pari mutuel betting would mean that
you would be paying money out with no
money coming in. That would hardly commend itself to any person, even those of limited
intelligence.
Honourable senators, I believe I have
finished. I would like to close with the
remark that our consideration of the bill was
intensive, and although it was carried out
in a short space of time you need not fear
that it was hastily done or that we took any
short cuts in order to complete the job. We
feel that we devoted the time that was
necessary to do the job, and we think that
in the document before you we have presented a fairly good product.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. M. Aselline: Honourable senators,
I wish to make a few brief remarks at this
time, although I always feel, after listening
to the honourable chairman of the Banking
and Commerce Committee (Hon. Mr. Hayden)
that there is little left to be said.
It is my opinion that this is the most
important piece of legislation that has been
brought before parliament for many a day.
It affects the life and liberty of every individual in the whole of Canada. Therefore it is
of tremendous significance. I feel that the
government of the day is to be congratulated
upon sending such a complicated bill to the
Senate for consideration rather than having it
introduced in the other house. I say that
because we have among the members of the
Senate distinguished counsel of nation-wide
prominence who have freely given of their
valuable time in order to study all the
different phases and parts of this legislation.
I refer to the chairman of the Banking and
Commerce Committee (Hon. Mr. Hayden), the
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) and the senator from VancouverSouth (Hon. Mr. Farris). Also, the Senate's
Law Clerk is a gentleman with a profound
knowledge of the law, and in my opinion one
of the ablest legal draftsmen that Canada has
ever had. Because of duties that kept me
engaged in a lower part of the building, I was
able to get up to only one meeting of the subcommittee that worked on this bill, but at
that meeting I was deeply impressed by the
detailed study that was being given not only
to every section, but to every sentence, every
line and every word. I regret that it was not
possible for me to attend further meetings.
Having practised law in western Canada for
some forty years or so, I am much interested
in the provisions for trial de novo, which have
been fully explained by the chairman of the
committee. The bill as drafted had dropped
68112-12&

these provisions, and I was afraid that it
would be impossible to have them restored.
I am pleased to inform honourable senators
that the Attorney General of the Province of
Saskatchewan objected to doing away with
trials de novo, and also that many magistrates
in our province asked me, when the bill came
up here for further consideration, to say to
the Senate that they thought failure to provide for trials de novo would be a retrograde
step.
I have had considerable experience with
trials of this kind, particularly in cases where
accused persons have been tried in the first
instance summarily before magistrates. Our
magistrates are not all lawyers, and quite
frequently when a case is heard before a lay
magistrate it does not receive the attention
that it would have received had he been a
lawyer. In many of these summary conviction cases also the accused does not fully
understand the seriousness of the charge
brought against him. Sometimes he appears
in court without any witnesses or counsel,
and before he knows it he is convicted and
fined, or perhaps even committed to jail. In
such a case it seems to me that it is only just
and proper that if the accused person feels
aggrieved he should be able to have a new
trial. And that is what is made possible by
provision for trials de novo, for in the notice
of appeal it is not necessary to state any
grounds; you are only required to state that
you are aggrieved by the conviction. Then a
new trial is granted, and you are given the
advantage of engaging counsel and calling
witnesses, so that when the case is over you
feel that you have had justice.
Hon. Mr. Reid: To whom do you appeal for
a new trial?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: The district court judge
or the county court judge. In Saskatchewan
these appeals are heard by district court
judges.
Furthermore, if you have to rely on the
evidence taken down by the magistrate you
will frequently find when you get his notes
that a great deal of the evidence in your
favour is not there at all. And perhaps some
of the evidence in favour of the prosecution
is not there. I understand that in Ontario
every magistrate has a reporter to take
down the evidence, but this is not so in Saskatchewan. We have no such facilities at all
in many places, and it is only when cases are
tried in the larger centres, or in the Court of
Queen's Bench, and so on, that there is a
court reporter on hand at all times. Often
if we want the evidence taken down in a
summary trial, we ourselves have to provide
a stenographer, and at many outlying district points no stenographer at all is available.

SENATE
For these reasons it seems to me that in a
nrnvinrp like

Saskatchewan or Alberta, or

even Manitoba and the northern parts of
British Columbia, it would be a bad thing
if trials de novo were abolished. As things
now stand, it is frequently impossible for an
accused person to have justice done at the
first trial in those territories, and therefore it
is essential that there should be machinery
for a rehearing.
I was also asked before I came to Ottawa
at the beginning of this session to urge
another point on the committee studying this
bill. That was that there should be a definition of "magistrate" which would require
that he be a lawyer of at least five years'
standing. However, after talking over the
matter with the chairman of the committee
I was given to understand that in many parts
of Canada it would be impossible to put that
requirement into effect at present, but that
it is the intention and policy of the attorneys
genoral of the different provinces to bring
about a change whereby only lawyers of some
standing will be appointed as magistrates.
Honourable senators, that is all I have to
say about the bill and the committee's report.
I am pleased with the way in which the
matter has been handled. The committee
had a hard task, and it has done a good job
of which I think the Senate bas every reason
to be very proud.
Hon. Mr. Horner: May I ask a simple layman's question? Where do the dogs run?
Have they any rights under this bill?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Well, the dogs have not
made an application before the Senate committee.

Some Hon. Senalors: Oh, oh.
TJn.

Mr, Hayden: An application was made

on behalf of some organization-not an organization of dogs, but rather of friends of the
dogs-to the end that their dog-running
might be made remunerative. As no action
was taken by the Senate committee with
regard to that aspect of the bill, the matter
does not now come before us.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
if no one else wishes to address the Senate
at this time, may J ask the leader if I am
right in assuming that there is no particular
reason why we should pass the bill tonight?
It is an important bill, and if no other honourable senator wishes to speak to it, I would
move the adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
notwithstanding the fact that the chairman
of the committee has spoken tonight, and
others have expressed their views, I think it
only proper that the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) should
have every opportunity to give us the benefit
of his remarks. I know of no reason why
we should not resume the discussion tomorrow afternoon.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the sponsor of the
bill if it is the intention to have this measure
incorporated into the new revised statutes?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I understand so.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Roebuck was
agreed to, and the debate was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

The Senate met at 3 p.m., the Speaker in

Prayers and routine proceedings.
EDITOR OF DEBATES
RETIREMENT OF MR. H. H. EMERSON

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, before the Orders of the Day are
proceeded with I should like to make two
statements. Honourable members will recall
that on Wednesday, December 10, the Senate
took action to facilitate the retirement o!
Harold Horton Emerson, Editor of Debates
and Chief of Reporting Branch of the Senate.
This step was taken, under the provisions of
the Civil Service Superannuation Act, to
effect the retirement to which he was entitled
and which he himself had requested.
Mr. Emerson has a reportorial background.
His father was a shorthand reporter, and his
mother's two brothers followed the sarne
calling. His father, for many years an
official reporter of the Supreme Court of
Ontario, was a founder and the first secretary
of the Chartered Shorthand Reporters Association of Ontario, incorporated by the Legislature in 1891.
Mr. Emerson joined the Hansard Staff of
the House of Commons in 1906 as an
amanuensis and remained in that position for
two sessions. He then obtained a position
in Toronto, and in November 1909 be went
to Alberta and became secretary to the then
premier, the Hon. A. C. Rutherford. Later he
was appointed Assistant Clerk of the Executive Council and Assistant Clerk of the Legislative Assembly. Owing to the serious illness
of his father he returned to Toronto in 1912,
and the same year became once more an
amanuensis on the Commons Hansard.
In 1913 he entered the reporting field,
where he worked on the Grand Trunk Railway Arbitration, under the chairmanship of
United States ex-President William Howard
Taft, and on the Supreme Court of Ontario,
the Board of Railway Commissioners, as it
was then called, and other bodies.
In 1917, when the official reporting staff
of the Senate was organized, be became a
member of it and has remained one ever since.
He was appointed Editor of Debates and Chief
of the Reporting Branch of the Senate after
the death of Mr. Halpin, in 1944.
When Mr. Emerson retires, on January 1,
1953, it will be forty-seven years since he

first began rendering service to parliament,
and thirty-six years since he joined the Sen:te Hc'nsQrd sftP
fis service during that
period has been characterized by unfailing
courtesy and the utmost efficiency. He carries into his well-earned retirement the best
wishes of, I believe, every member of this
house. We wish him long life and happiness,
and hope that he will from time to time
revisit the surroundings with which he has
for so long been familiar.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
I agree with everything that has been said by
the honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson).
I think I am safe in saying that all of us
have found Mr. Emerson to be a most courteous, careful, capable and efficient employee
of the Senate over a very long period of
years. All of these qualities are evidenced by
his excellent work as Editor of Senate Debates.
His successor will, in my opinion, find it hard
to fill his shoes. My personal associations
and contacts with Mr. Emerson have been
most happy indeed. We on this side of the
chamber sincerely regret that he finds it
necessary at this time to retire. Many of us
feel that we are losing not only a good friend,
but also a very valuable public servant. We
wish him to know that we have always
appreciated his services to this body, and we
hope that he has many happy years to look
forward to.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, may I also say just a word or two?
I do so because I feel honoured in being able
to call Mr. Emerson a friend; and I am sure
almost every senator owes him a degree of
gratitude for the number of corrections that
he has made in preparing their remarks
for Hansard. Mr. Emerson, a widely read
gentleman, has been most vigilant and industrious in the editing of our debates. I say
that in addition to all that has been said
about his cordial, courteous and delightful
personality. Irrespective of how efficient his
successor may be-and I have no lack of
confidence in his successor-the Senate will
be the poorer for Mr. Emerson's retirement.
One cannot but feel like moralizing a little
at the close of a chapter as long as this one.
Mr. Emerson joined the Senate reporting
staff, as we have just been told, in 1917, but
be began his services around these buildings
as long ago as 1906-just four years short
of half a century ago. One can imagine the
mental and nervous reactions that must come
to a person who severs connections of that
long standing. I hope that he will not feel,
as be may well do, the shock of the sudden
break, and want to return and take his place
amongst us.

SENATE

DEPUTY GOVERNMENT LEADER IN
THE SENATE
TRIBUTES TO SENATOR HUGESSEN ON HIS
RETIREMENT FROM THAT OFFICE
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I very much regret that it becomes necessary
for me to report to this house the retirement
of the honourable senator for Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) from the position of Deputy
Leader of the Government in the Senate.
Senator Hugessen wrote me before this session of parliament opened, indicating that
since his senior law ipartner, Mr. W. B. Scott,
Q.C., had been appointed Associate Chief
Justice of the Superior Court for the province of Quebec, added responsibilities made
It necessary for him to ask to be relieved
of his duties as Deputy Leader.
While I am sure that we all are happy to
congratulate him on having become the
aenior partner of the law firm with which he
is associated, we regret exceedingly one of
the consequences which has followed. Under
the circumstances, I did not feel that I should
urge him unduly to reconsider his decision,
although I should have liked to do so. The
best I could do was to prevail upon him to
continue until the Christmas adjournment.
I can hardly over-emphasize how much I
personally have been indebted to him for
his unswerving loyalty, his wise counsel and
his unfailing courtesy. The one bright spot
is that, while he will not be continuing in
the role of Deputy Leader, the Senate itself
will still be able to enjoy the benefit of his
friendliness and his faculty for clear and
eloquent expression. I thank him sincerely
for all he has done for me, and I wish him
well in the added responsibilities he has
assumed in the practice of his chosen profession.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. M. Aseline: Honourable senators,
I am indeed glad this is not an obituary
address.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: During the time the
honourable gentleman from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) has been Deputy Leader of
the Government in the Senate, particularly
when conducting the affairs of this chamber
in the absence of his leader, we have always
found him congenial and co-operative to the
greatest idegree. I am making these few
remarks on his retirement from the office
of Deputy Leader on the other side of the
house because I hold a similar position on
this side.

We are all happy that he is advancing in
the world; we always like to see young
rellows getting ahead.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: He is now the senior
partner of a great legal firm in the city of
Montreal, but we hope that the eminence he
has attained will not keep him from taking
his usual important part in the debates of
this chamber, for I would say that some of
the finest speeches ever made in this house
have been made by him.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: He also has introduced
in this chamber some of the most important
legislation to come before us.
We regret that he has found it necessary
to retire from his present office, but we are
glad that he will still be with us, and we wish
him a Merry Christmas and a Happy New
Year.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
although I presume it is fitting for me to say
a few words on this occasion, I must confess
that I am very much embarrassed in being
called upon to do so. I do want to thank my
honourable friend, the leader of the government, (Hon. Mr. Robertson) and the honourable acting leader on the other side of the
house (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) for the extremely
kind words which they have said about mewords which, I must say frankly, I feel are
undeserved.
As my leader has said, it was with a great
deal of regret that I had to replace in his
hands the position that he confided to me
some two years ago as deputy leader. The
only reason for this is the added responsibilities that have accrued to me in my legal
firm in Montreal as a result of the appointment of my senior partner as Associate
Chief Justice of the Province of Quebec. I
want to say to my honourable leader that I
was greatly honoured when he asked me to
take this position, and that during the two
years I have occupied this office it has been
a source of great pleasure to me to have
been so closely associated with him in the
business of this house. We have never had
any personal disagreement. The only times
we have disagreed have been on one or two
occasions when he, in his capacity as a member of the government, has had to support
certain legislation in this chamber. I refer
in particular to margarine.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: That was a condition
which was agreed upon between us when I
assumed the position of deputy leader.

DECEMBER 17, 1952
I want to thank the leader most warmly for
the consideration he has always shown me and
for the confidence that he has placed in me.
I also want to thank the members of the house
for the kindness, consideration and forbearance with which they treated me on those
occasions when I had something to do with
the conduct of the business of the chamber.
I am indeed glad that the honourable acting leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) does
not consider this to be an obituary address.
I do not myself so regard it.
I do hope to attend this chamber as frequently as possible and to take an active part
in its debates and discussions, though perhaps not in quite as responsible a position
as the one I have occupied for the last two
years. Thank you very much.
CRIMINAL CODE BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE CONCURRED IN

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of the report of the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce on Bill O,
an Act respecting the Criminal Law.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I am very happy in the atmosphere that
has been developed prior to the commencement of my remarks on this subject today,
which I expect and hope will be our last
sitting day before the adjournment. While
the atmosphere is still good I want to express
my thanks to the deputy leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), both on behalf
of myself and the other members of the subcommittee of the Banking and Commerce
Committee, for the very kind remarks which
he made in this debate yesterday evening.
The task of the sub-committee was a heavy
one, but there was a very great deal of satisfaction attached to it because the importance
of the subject called for the very best work
of which we were capable.
I also wish to join with the chairman of the
sub-committee and of the main committee,
the senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden),
in his references to the able assistance which
we received from Mr. A. A. Moffat, Q.C., and
Mr. A. J. MacLeod of the staff of the Department of Justice. I marvelled at the detailed
knowledge of the Code possessed by these
gentlemen; they could state the 'provisions of
a section as soon as its number was mentioned.
Their familiarity with the text of the Code
reminded me of the familiarity of some
divines with the ancient Book. They quoted
from the law and cited passages with a
facility that was amazing.
I think it would be a mistake if we did not
also acknowledge the assistance given by our
own staff, in the first instance by our most

able legal counsel, Mr. J. F. MacNeill, Q.C.
We are much indebted to him for his wise
advice and tireless aid in this tremendous
work of revision. I couple with his name,
although in a different capacity, the Clerk of
the Committee, Mr. James D. MacDonald,
who did nearly all the clerical work in connection with the revision. And I should mention also the stenographers, who worked overtime to have the amendments prepared in
readiness for our consideration at this time.
The whole staff under Mr. Armstrong, Chief
Clerk of Committees, worked conscientiously
and for long hours in their struggle to get
the work through. And it has all been worth
while. Speaking personally and on behalf of
my fellow members of the committee and the
others who worked with us, I can confidently
say that it has all been worth while, because
of the tremendous importance of the subject.
Perhaps I can give a more vivid impression of what it all means if I tell you that
according to the Canadian Year Book of
1951, which contains the latest available
statistics, the total number of persons convicted in Canadian courts in the year 1948,
for offences of all kinds, was 918,277. That
is, there were nearly one million convictions
by the courts for offences of one kind or
another under the Criminal Code, under other
federal statutes, under provincial laws, municipal ordinances, and so on. That is a very
large number, out of a population of about
14 million. It bears a ratio of 102 - 1 to every
thousand of our population. And remember,
that is only the total of the accused persons
who were convicted. In addition, many persons accused before the courts were acquitted.
Then of course a large number of people
appeared as complainants, to say nothing of
those who were called as witnesses. I draw
attention to this because I think it shows,
as nothing else could, the importance of the
rules of the game that we are laying down
at present, rules that directly affect the lives
-and sometimes may even result in taking
away the lives-of many subjects, and that in
a material sense affect the lives of nearly all
of us.
In the past a person who was convicted of
some offence paid a fine or served his sentence, and that was the end of it. But today
if a conviction is registered for a crime that
involves what is called moral turpitude, the
convicted person is barred from crossing
the international border. Our Immigration
Act contains the same provision as does the
American Immigration Act in that regard.
And the law officers of the Crown have
extended the term "moral turpitude" to
include even an assault-although I think
that sometimes one who commits an assault

SENATE
should be congratulated rather than condemned. I told the Deputy Minister of Justice
that if we were all subjected to the test of
whether or not we had committeed assault,
within the meaning of the words "applying
physical force to the person of another person
or threatening to do so," I did not suppose
there was anyone in the whole of Canada, any
male at all events, who could legally cross
the border. I recall the famous statement
that John Burns once made in the House of
Commons at Westminster, that there are
occasions when a smash in the jaw is a good
argument. And there are circumstances in
which if a person did not apply physical
force or at least threaten to do so, I would
hold him in contempt.
I refer to this simply to show how wide
the effect of a conviction may be in these
modern times. It might involve a person
for many years to come. In every application for a bond, and in various other documents, the question is asked "Were you ever
convicted of any crime?" And the answer has
to be written in.
Instead of giving only the total number
of convictions for a year, it might be more
interesting to state figures of convictions
for important offences. In 1948 there were
no less than 48,066 charges of indictable
offences brought before the courts of Canada,
and under those charges 41,632 persons were
convicted.
That is a startling number.
As far as individual cases go, it is not quite
correct, because some were charged with
two offences at the one time, and some 3,724
were convicted of more than one offence at
the time of trial. In that year non-indictable
offences numbered 876,000 odd. Punishments
for indictable offences varied. Fines, were
imposed upon 12,680 convicted persons, and
the death penalty was made to apply to nineteen persons.
Traffic regulations are of course not in this
Code, but they do account for a great deal
of activity in our courts. In the year 1948,
violations of traffic regulations numbered
no less than 649,000. That, I think, is enough
to show that the importance of the subject
can scarcely be denied.
In view of the clear and rather extensive
review of the bill given last night by the chairman of the committee (Hon. Mr. Hayden),
there is very little left for me to say. That
will be welcome news to honourable senators.
However, there are some things which I
think I should say-I go first to the question
of treason. Treason involves the question of
life and death, the welfare of the state and
the titular head of the state, with all the
ancient connotations and tragedies; it is a
subject which catches the public mind and
imagination. Whatever the reason may be,

our dealings with the sections on treason seem
to have provoked almost undue interest. I
notice in one of the morning papets, a heading to this effect: Senators vote lighter penalties for treason and espionage. I appreciate
the great difficulty that a newspaper reporter
faces in his endeavour to write accurately
about the work of the sub-committee and of
the general committee on the technical
aspects of this subject. But let me say that
we did not vote lighter penalties for treason
and espionage. What we did was to remove
one paragraph from the treason section and
put it in another section. In that way we
perhaps lowered the penalty from life imprisonment or less to fourteen years or less. If
there is any difficulty the penalty can very
easily be increased. However, fourteen years
is a long sentence.
I refer now specifically to subsection (1)
of section 46, which is as follows:
(1) Every one commits treason who, in Canada,
(a) kills or attempts to kill Her Majesty-

We have intensified and amplified that
paragraph. We carried into the bill the

words of the present Code which in the
amendments had been dropped, dropped-as
far as I can see, without any particular justification-and we added these words:
-or does her any bodily harm tending to death or
destruction, maims or wounds her, or imprisons or
restrains her.

It is apparent that in that way we have
extended the treason provisions.
I turn now to paragraph (c), which reads:
(c)

assists an enemy at war with Canada-

Nobody would object to that. Certainly
anyone who assists the enemy commits treason, according to its ancient definition. But
the paragraph goes on:
-or
any armed forces against whom Canadian
forces are engaged in hostilities whether or not a
state of war exists between Canada and the country whose forces they are.

The idea of making it treason to assist a
country against whom there is neither a
declaration of war nor any statement by the

government with regard to it, simply because
its forces are engaged in hostilities with our

forces, is entirely new law.

I do not say

the law is unjustified, provided the person
who commits such an offence knows that he

is doing it; but I would call the attention of
the house to a recent incident when our forces
were engaged, without our knowledge, on the
island of Koje. I would point out to honourable members that our forces are today under
the command of the United Nations, not of
our own government. Further, by reason
of the activities in Korea, we may be engaged
in hostilities with two great nations against
whom there has been no declaration of war

DECEMBER 17, 1952
and no desire to declare war. My only concern with this particular provision is that
it be clarified, so that nobody may be caught
in the crime of treason because of having
assisted the forces not of an enemy countryof a friendly country-which happens to be
engaged with our forces.
For that reason the sub-committee suggested
that the word "knowingly" be added, so as
to avoid misunderstanding. If war is declared,
that is of course a different matter; but in the
mixed-up state of the world today some care
is required in dealing with one of the most
heinous of all criminal offences. The proposed
amendment to add the word "knowingly",
was not adopted by the Banking and Commerce Committee. The clause remains as it
was drawn, but I am not very well satisfied
with it.
Paragraph (e) in the treason section of the
Code was, I thought, even more open to
criticism than paragraph (c). Paragraph (e)
reads:
(e) conspires with an agent of a state other than
Canada to communicate information or to do an
act that is likely to be prejudicial to the safety or
interests of Canada.

sedition. My comment with regard to the
section is this. There should be the most
stringent prohibition of the wrongful giving
to others of information which may be prejudicial to the safety of Canada. In that
direction you cannot go too far. The man
who knowingly, for the purpose of injuring
Canada, gives away our secrets with regard
to atomic knowledge, the bomb, and the like,
is the worst and the vilest criminal among us.
On the other hand, in attempting to legislate
against him let us not interfere with free
speech in our own -country. Let us not be
too sweeping. My thought with regard to
this clause is that it should be re-drawn in
such a way that that against which we inveigh
shall be properly and definitely covered. It
may require a whole paragraph in the Official
Secrets Act, or the Code, or elsewhere. What
I object to about this clause is the draftmanship; I am not satisfied with it at all.
In that connection let me repeat what was
said last evening by the honourable senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden). This present revision is not a revision of the substance
of the Code but only of its structure. The
purpose of it was to clarify, rearrange and
condense. The job was given to commissioners; but they have gone a good deal
further, and have made quite a number of
amendments to the substance of the Code.
Nevertheless what they have done is not a
survey as such of the substance of the .clauses
of the Code; it is by no means the final word;
it is but a beginning, I think, of the revision of our criminal law; and as a result of
the attention that has been directed to the
Code through these clarifying amendments, I
look for many other amendments in the
immediate years to come. I suggest to the
government that at the next session, or even
earlier-because there is plenty of time yetthe clause to which I have referred be thought
over carefully, with a full realization of its
importance, and that an amendment be prepared and brought in which will make its
meaning clear to everybody, myself included,
-and I yield to no one in my loyalty to
Canada and my interest in her safety.
In passing, let me say that I wish the
commissioners had given us a definition of
sedition. Here is the present definition:

Let me deal with the various ingredients
of that paragraph. "Conspires with an agent
of a state other than Canada". The word
"agent" could mean any civil servant of any
country other than Canada-of the United
States or the United Kingdom, for instance,
or of any of our fellow members of the British
"Agent" is a very wide
Commonwealth.
term; there are literally thousands of agents
through whom information is conveyed.
Then we come to the words, "to cornmunicate information". What kind of information? Atomic information? It is not stated.
It might be the most harmless and trifling
information, or something which is well
known to everybody. No term could be
wider than the word "information", and there
is but one qualification, that it is likely to
be-not necessarily, but possibly-prejudicial to the safety or interests of Canada.
What are the "interests of Canada"? Does
"Canada" signify the land of Canada, the
people of Canada, or some section of the
people of Canada-St. James street, for
instance? Or does it mean, perhaps, the labour

That is all right as applied to military
forces. We must be careful with regard to
them, because they may be engaged in hostilities with our enemies. But on page 24
of the bill you will find these words:
(2) In this section, "member of a force" means
a member of
(a) the Canadian Forces,

DECEMBER 17, 1952
(b) the naval, army or air forces of a state other
than Canada that are lawfully present in Canada, or
(c) the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

I spoke about this matter in detail in committee, and indeed on previous occasions in
this house, but I do wish that my fellow
members would join with me in an effort to
keep the Royal Canadian Mounted Police a
civilian force and not allow it to become a
military force. We do not want a military
force to do our police work.
I should like to refer the house now to
section 372, which deals with mischief. I
do not expect the members of this chamber to
agree with me any more than did the members
of the Banking and Commerce Committee in
my views on this section.
I read from the section:
372. (1) Every one commits mischief who wilfully
(a) destroys or damages property,
(b) renders property dangerous, useless, inoperative or ineffective,
(c) obstructs, interrupts or interferes with the
lawful use, enjoyment or operation of property,-

I submit that no strike ever took place in
this country that did not do one or
other of those things. Strikes have always
interfered in some way with the enjoyment
or operation of property. That is usually
the very purpose of a strike.
In committee I suggested that the followin-g
words be inserted: "A lawful act done in
furtherance of the purpose of a trade union
is not mischief". I also suggested that this
clause be included in another section, but I
will not take time to deal with that now. I
think I can see the humour of what happened
yesterday in committee. There I stood in
splendid isolation, the only one who voted
for my amendment. That is perfectly aIl
right, but you will hear about that clause in
the future or I am no prophet.
There is just one more matter I wish to
discuss, and it has to do with the right of
appeal. There was unanimous agreement on
this point in committee, and I want to say
something about the justification of it.
According to the common law, which is read
into this section, a judge on the bench has
the right to call anybody to appear before
him, or if the person is before him, order him
to stand up, and then in his capacity as the
chief of the proceedings convict the person of
contempt of court and impose somue penalty
-perhaps a fine or a jail sentence-and there
is no appeal. In all the offences dealt with
in the 748 sections of our Code, this offence,
and this offence alone, is the only one in which
the decision of the judge is absolutely final.
He acts as the witness as to what has taken
place, he is the prosecuting attorney, he is
the judge, and he is the executioner.

Hon. Mr. Ross: What section are you dealing
with?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Section 8. ~This sort of
thing is not healthy from the standpoint of
those who suffer under it, and it is not
healthy from the standpoint of the judge. The
Banking and Commerce Committee is recommending an amendment in this bill which
will give a person who is accused by a judge
of contempt of court-not in the face of the
court-the right to appeal against the conviction and also against the sentence. The individual who is convictetd of the offence of
contempt of court in the face of the court
has the right to appeal against the sentence
only. The difference is this. It is necessary
to maintain the dignity of the court and the
control of the presiding officer over the court.
If a person interrupts court proceedings, for
instance, and defies an order of the judge to
sit down, the judge has no option but to order
the constable to place him under arrest and
commit him for contempt-and he is kept
in custody until he has cooled off. If the
judge imposes a long sentence, then of course
under the new Code there probably would
be an appeal, but there would be no right of
appeal against the conviction itself. Perhaps
there should be, but in the committee we
thought we had gone far enough in providing
an appeal against the sentence in such cases.
I could refer to a number of instances of
conviction for this offence. I am not holding
any briefs for newspapers, but they or their
employees have been the ones most frequently
involved. Not long ago in this very city the
editor of one newspaper was called before
a judge and fined $3,000 for contempt of
court. I do not say the conviction and fine
were not perfectly justified, but I do think
that the party who suffered under the decision
would have been better satisfied with the
justice of it had he been able to have the
case reviewed by some higher court, by
judges who were not so close to the prosecution as the one who testified against the
person accused, found him guilty and wrote
the judgment. It would have been a healthier
state of affairs if that decision could have
been submitted for review by another court.
I do think that this amendment to the Code
is a really-good one, thoroughly justified, and
that it will be well received by courts across
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Would the honourable senator permit me to ask a question about the
wording of paragraph (b) of section 8. It
reads:
Notwithstanding anything in this Act or any
other Act no person shall be convicted

(b) of an offence under an Act of the Parliament
of England, or of Great Britain, or of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland-

166

SENATE

Should that not read "Great Britain and
northern Ireland"?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No. As I stated previously, no charge can be laid under the Code
except for an offence that is within the four
corners of the Code. We are reading out of
this Code the statutory law of Great Britain,
of the United Kingdom, and of Great Britain
and Ireland. I think that "Great Britain" in
this instance includes northern Ireland, and
that "Ireland" means southern Ireland.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The section goes on to
say also that no person shall be convicted
(c) of an offence under an Act or ordinance in
force in any province, territory or place before
that province, territory or place became a province of Canada.

So the whole law of the provinces of Upper
Canada and Lower Canada, of the Northwest
Territories and of Manitoba before it became a part of Canada, is now a thing of the
past, so far as the criminal law is concerned,
and one cannot be convicted of a criminal
offence that does not come within the four
corners of this Code.
Honourable senators, I thank you for the
kind attention with which you have heard
me. I am happy about this piece of work and
the report which is before us, on which we
shall be voting shortly. I am sorry that you
have not had more time to study the report.
It would have been better if at least several
days had intervened between the time of its
presentation here and the vote upon it,
because the report is really voluminous. It
recommends no fewer than 117 amendments,
in addition to the 63 amendments that our
committee made last year. In all, we have
suggested 180 amendments to the Code that
came to us last session. If you were to try
to follow the report in detail it would require
some hours of careful study to find out even
what we were doing.
As I say, I am sorry that we have not a
little more time, but it seems to be in the
public interest that we pass the bill today.
I express my satisfaction in what I think is
a real improvement to the Code and some
improvement to the substantive criminal
law of Canada. If as a result of our work the
Code is improved, we shall have conferred
a benefit upon thousands and hundreds of
thousands of our fellow citizens.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators,
although I am a member of the Banking
and Commerce Committee, which considered
this bill, I wish to assure you at the outset
that I have not the slightest intention of
dealing with the subject-matter of the bill,
beyond saying that I approve of all the

changes that have been made, and particularly, perhaps, in that part of the Code
which designates wbhnt vrnstitutes treason.
I merely rise to say that I think it would
be unfortunate if someone did not convey to
the members of the sub-committee the appreciation of the main committee itself and of
the members of this house as a whole for
the work which the sub-committee has done.
Those of you who attended the meetings of
the committee know what a thorough study
was made of the Code. Had that not been
done, the Senate, I think, would have found
it utterly impossible to pass intelligently upon
this voluminous bill. We had a great deal of
confidence in the members of the sub-committee, and I think everyone will agree that
it was justified. Three or four gentlemen
learned in the law, leaders in their profession, gave freely of services which if one may
judge from the fees that lawyers of their
eminence sometimes charge to large corpora-

tions, must have been worth many thousands
of dollars.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: They will be rewarded
in the next world.
Hon. Mr. Euler: They did it without remuneration, their only reward being the satisfaction of having done a good job.
The few times I attended sittings of the
committee I learned a great deal about the
criminal law. In fact, some of the things
I heard there were almost alarming. It must
have occurred to some other members of the
committee, as it did to me, that one might
commit a criminal offence without being
aware of it. I sometimes think that there is
a tendency in government today-I include
governments in general-to fall into the habit
of what may be called witch-hunting. Perhaps that is too strong a term, but honourable senators will understand what I mean.
I repeat that my main purpose in rising
was to place on the records of this house,
on my own behalf and, I am sure, that of
all other members of the Banking and Commerce Committee, and of the Senate as a
whole, our appreciation of the great work
which these gentlemen of the sub-committee
have done.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
before the report is adopted I should like to
associate myself with the remarks made by
my deskmate, the honourable senator from
KitchenerHon. Mr. Euler: Waterloo!
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes, from Waterloo. And
I may add, my senior in years by a narrow
margin and in experience by a very substantial margin.

DECEMBER 17, 1952
done by the Banking and Commerce Committee in their consideration of this measure.
Honourable senators will recall that Bill
H-8, an Act respecting the Criminal Law, was
first introduced on May 12, 1952, during the
last session of parliament. The Minister of
Justice came to this house to speak on the
motion for second reading, and on May 15
the bill was referred to the Banking and Commerce Committee. The main committee
appointed a sub-committee to consider the
measure clause by clause, and after twelve
meetings they reported to the main committee on June 20, suggesting approximately
sixty amendments. The main committee held
three meetings, considered the amendments,
and subsequently reported to the Senate
recommending that, because of the amount of
work still to be done, the bill be not further
proceeded with at that session.
A new bill was presented to this bouse at
the earliest possible moment, and on November 25 it was referred .to the Banking and
Commerce Committee. This new bill incorporated many of the amendments proposed
by the sub-committee during the previous
session. Again the sub-committee set themselves to their painstaking task, and after
fifteen meetings reported to the main committee on December 5, suggesting 104 amendments. The main committee proceeded to
a detailed consideration of the proposed
amendments, heard witnesses and reported to
the house yesterday, December 16.
It must, of course, be pointed out that many
of the amendments were relatively minor in
nature, involving such questions as phraseology; but the fact that in the two sessions they
numbered 164 in all indicates that none of
the 744 sections were accepted without
scrutiny.
I am bound to point out that the burden
of the work fell on the sub-committee of the
Banking and Commerce Committee. I congratulate all members of the committee, but
I feel that I should especially mention the
Chairman, the Honourable Senator Hayden,
and the Honourable Senators Roebuck and
Farris, who brought to bear on this important
question the wide experience and undoubted
knowledge of the law which has made them
outstanding in the legal fraternity of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Euler: You need not keep your Associated with them was the Law Clerk of
word.
the Senate, whose faithful services are so
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable often available to the committees of the
senators, there is little that I can add by way Senate and are perhaps too frequently taken
of useful comment on the committee's report for granted, and also the law officers of the
on this important bill. I only desire to express Department of Justice, who patiently renmy thanks and appreciation for the very dered every assistance. All in all, these
thorough and painstaking work that has been gentlemen formed a team that for a task of
Hon. Mr. Euler: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: How about wisdom?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The bill before us is probably one of the most important pieces of
legislation to be dealt with by this house for
a considerable period of time. Obviously, it
was impossible for a layman like myself to
grasp its full import. The measure was confided to the Banking and Commerce Committee, and the work of that committee is
refiected in the report presented to the house
yesterday.
While the committee did an excellent job on
the measure, I should like to direct particular
attention to the honourable senators from
Toronto, Toronto-Trinity and Vancouver
South.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Why not name them, so
that they will go down in history?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I will do that. They are
the honourable senators Hayden, Roebuck and
Farris. They devoted a great deal of close
attention to this bill. These gentlemen-all
of them eminent in the law-have prepared
a report which individuals like myself can
accept with confidence.
One other comment that I should like to
make is this: The nature of the amendments
impressed upon my mind the fact that the
committee had done an excellent job in one
particular respect. It is the tendency of law
administrators and prosecutors to attempt to
pave the way to easy convictions. That is an
insidious danger in the law-making process
of this country. I was happy to note that the
committee appeared to guard very effectively
against that tendency. Indeed, the amendments made by the sub-committee, accepted
by the main committee, and now before the
house, add many safeguards to the bill as
originally drafted. In that respect I believe
the amendments improve the legislation. To
my mind, nothing is more important in the
law making process than to protect the liberty,
freedom and rights of the individual, and to
assure that justice will be meted out with
caution and fairness. In this I think the committee has succeeded.
I told my colleague from Waterloo that I
would not speak any longer than he did, so
I must conclude my remarks.

ADJOURNMENT
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
we have disposed of the Address in reply
to the Speech from the Throne, and of all
items on the order paper.
We have passed fourteen government bills,
including the Act respecting Criminal Law
and the Act respecting Food, Drugs, Cosmetics and Therapeutic Devices, which were
major revisions of existing statutes, and
involved the hearing of witnesses and much
committee work. We have passed three
private bills and seventy-four divorce bills,
a total of ninety-one.
As we have completed our work, and as
there is no further business before us and
it is unlikely that there will be much for
us to do until two or three weeks after the
House of Commons assembles on January 12,
I would move, subject of course to the
authority already given to His Honour the
Speaker to call us back in case of necessity:
That when this house adjourns today it stand

DISASTROUS STORMS AND FLOODS
MOTION OFFERING SYMPATHY AND HELP TO
THE UNITED KINGDOM, THE NETHERLANDS
AND BELGIUM

Hon. Wishari McL. Robertson: Honourable

senators, with leave of the Senate I desire
to move, seconded by the honourable leader
of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig):
That His Honour the Speaker be asked to convey
to Her Majesty the Queen, te Her Majesty the
Queen of the Netherlands and te His Maiesty the
King of Belgians, the deep sympathy of The Senate
of Canada te the people of the United Kingdom,
the Netherlands and Belgium who have been se
sorely stricken by the appalling disaster which has
befallen them. We believe that it would be the
earnest desire of the Canadian people te manifest
their sympathy te the sufferers in concrete form and
will gladly support whatever proposals te this end
the Government
of Canada may present te
parliament.

Honourable senators, we have all been
deeply moved by the news of the disasters
on sea and land that have resulted from
the terrible storms raging about the United
Kingdom and in the channel between the
United Kingdom and Continental Europe.
As a result of the inscrutable ways of
Providence no peoples nor portions of the

world's surface by sea or land are immune
from the destructive forces of the elements.
From time to time, as if to remind mankind
that a Supreme Authority presides over the
universe, the forces of nature are unloosed,
bringing disaster in their trail. Sometimes
a disaster occurs far away, and sometimes
near at home. But, wherever it occurs, its
only redeeming feature is that it serves to
quicken one of the finer instincts of human
nature, and awakens a spontaneous desire on
the part of the more fortunate to extend all
possible comfort and relief to those who are
less fortunate. We in Canada, in recent
times, have witnessed and been beneficiaries
of this fine instinct on the part of those beyond
our borders, and I feel that the country as
a whole would wish the Senate to join with
the House of Commons in expressing, on
behalf of the people of Canada, sympathy for
those who have suffered, and the resolve
to help in whatever manner may, in due
course, prove to be the most effective.
I commend to you, honourable senators, the
motion that has just been presented for your
consideration.

Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
in seconding the motion of the honourable
leader of the government, I may perhaps be
pardoned if I refer to certain disastrous
events in the province from which I come.
Honourable senators will recall that about
three years ago the people of Manitoba
suffered a disastrous flood. From my place
in this chamber I have already thanked the
government of Canada and the government
of the province of Manitoba for the help given
to the flood victims.
But tonight I am reminded of the generous
assistance which came to the people of the
Red River Valley from outside Canada. It
may now be said that the relief funds were
so well administered that, after all claims
were paid, a substantial amount of money
was left over. This sum is being transferred
ta the custody of a body ta be set up by the
parliament of Canada, and I am hoping that
some of it may find its way back to the
people in parts of Europe and England who
themselves have suffered severely in the
recent storms. There can be no finer illustration of the wisdom of casting one's bread on
the waters. I am sure that all those people in
other countries who sent aid to us will be
glad to know that their gifts have met our
needs, and that something is left over to
help others in trouble today.

FEBRUARY 3. 1953
I think I know sornething of the feelings
in the minds of people who watch flood waters
rise day by day and hour by hour. I know
sornething also of how they are encouraged
to meet such disasters when people frorn al
over the world offer assistance. It is aur
opportunity now to reciprocate by helping the
flood victims of Great Britain, Holland and
.Belgium.
I arn sure I speak flot only for ail senators
and members of the other house, but also
for ail Canadians in saying that we appreciate
what has been done for us when we were

stricken by disasters, and that we will al
stand behind the government and support
it in whatever it does to relieve the present
distress in those three countries. Whether
the government decides to off er assistance
through the Red Cross or another mnediurn,
it can rest assured that we pledge aur full
support.

THE LATE SENATORS LACASSE AND
DAVID
TRIBUTES

TO THEIR MEMORY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, before the Orders of the Day are
proceeded with, I regret to have to .officially
inform the house that during the Christmas
adjournment we lost two of our outstanding
members, the honourable Senator Joseph
Henri Gustave Lacasse, who passed away on
January 18, and the honourable Senator
Louis Athanase David, Q.C., who died on
January 26.
Senator Lacasse was born on February 7,
1890, at Ste. Elizabeth de Joliette, Quebec, a
son of Annie Gernon and Francois Xavier O.
Lacasse. A physician, he was educated at
Montreal Seminary and Lavai University,
where he received his B.A. and M.D. degrees,
after which he practised medicine at
Tecumseh, near Windsor, Ontario. In 1915
he married Marie Anne St. Pierre, of East
Windsor, Ontario, and eleven eidren were
born to this union. Mrs. Lacasse died in 1944,
and in 1948 the late senator subsequently
married the former Rose Odine Sasseville, of
St. Hyacinthe, Quebec, who survives.
Through his Frencb-language newspaper,
of which he was editor-in-chief, Senator
Lacasse was an ardent supporter of the rights
of French-Canadian minorities. Always active
in civic aiffairs, he was elected Mayor of
Tecumseh in 1928, the year in which be was
called to the Senate. Other offices that he
held during a long and busy career were:
President of the Separate School Commission
of Tecumseh, from 1925-27; Medical Health
Officer of Sandwich East, 1914-1945; President
of the Medical Health Officers' Association;
member -and Director General for Ontario of
the Société des Artisans; Director of La
Sauvegarde Insurance Company; member of
68112-13

the Canadian Order of Foresters, Union St.
Joseph de Canada; President of the St. Jean
Baptiste Association, Ontario West, 1928-1930;
life member of the Association St. Jean Baptiste Association, Ottawa, 1951; President of
Maple Leaf Publishing Company; member of,
the Windsor Suburban Higb School Board,
1946-47. He -also occupied prominent positions in various medical societies.
Senator Lacasse was a member of this
chamber for about a quarter of a century.
He was appointed in 1928, and througbout
bis. long association witb the Senate he was
always deeply interested in the work o!
parliament, and faithfully attended our sittings. In keeping witb one of the basic functions and responsibilities of the Senate, he
strongly supported in this chamber the rights
of minorities, particularly of that minority of
which be himself was a member. On behaif
of honourable senators I wish to extend to bis
widow and children our deepest sympathy in
tbe great loss tbat they have suffered.
Senator David was born on June 24, 1882,
the son of the Honourable Laurent Olivier
David and Aibina Chenet, of Montreal. He
was educated at St. Mary's ýCollege, Mount
St. Louis, and Lavai University, from which
he received his LL.B. degree. Subsequently
he read law wîth Bu-chan and Elliot, and at
the age of twenty-three was called to, tbe
Quebec Bar.
He first practised law in 1905 in association with H. J. Elliot, Q.C., and ini later years
with the firms of David, Dugas and Webster,
and David, Perrier, Brossard and Demers.
In 1908 he married Antonia, daughter of the
Honourable G. A. Nantel, and to tbis unmion
were born five children, ail of wbom *survive.
Though the late senýator soon acbieved
prominen-ce in his chosen profession-be was
elected President of the Junior Bar in 1913,
and a member o! the Council of tbe Bar i
1914, and appointed a King's Counsel in 1915
-be also early became active in political
affairs. A close friend o! botb Sir Wilfrid
Laurier and Sir Lomer Gouin, be was first
elected to the Quebec legislature in 1916,
as member for Terrebonne. In 1919 be
was appointed Provincial Secretary, a post
which be held -continuously for seventeen
years, until 1936 when be resigned and temporarily retired !rom public lîfe.
As Provincial Secretary be encouraged
hygiene throughout rural areas and promoted
education, wrîting and painting, through
assistance to art scbools and galleries. In
order to stimulate the production of French
and English literature, he instituted the
annual David Prize Competition in which
English and French writers o! Quebec -competed for prize money awarded by the

SENATE
provincial government. As head of the
Department of Education, he gave utmost
consideration to ali aspects of the educational
problem. He established technical schools to
promote more interest among Quebec youth
in engineering fields.
In 1939 the late senator emerged from
retirement and was re-elected to the legislature, but resigned in 1940, in which year
he was summoned to the Senate.
In recent years Senator David's failing
health interfered somewhat with his attendance in the Senate and participation in our
debates, but the more senior members of
this chamber will recall the 'clearness, fluency
and eloquence which characterized his discussion of public questions. The friendliness
and courtesy which he invariably displayed
in his relations with his colleagues endeared
him to all. His knowledge of public affairs,
gained by study and long experience, won
for him the highest respect. We mourn his
loss, and we extend to his widow and children our deepest sympathy in their bereavement.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
Senator Lacasse was a member of this
chamber when I entered it some years ago,
and since then I came to know him
intimately. In the early years of my membership here he took a very active part in the
Senate's deliberations on such matters as
health, medical care and education.
I had the pleasure of some contact with
the late senator in a social way. He was one
of the delegates who went from Canada to
Bermuda in the fall of 1948 to meet with
representatives from the United States, the
United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia and
New Zealand, and he was accompanied by
his bride. I was delighted to meet her during
that nine-day period, and I recall an interesting incident. A table was assigned to the
delegates from each country, and although
Canada's table was set for four persons it
was usually occupied by only three.
On one occasion a United Kingdom delegate came over and asked us what had
happened. I said "There are four delegates,
from Canada, all right; indeed, we have five,
because with us is an unofficial delegate, the
bride of oneo ot our number, and if you go
to a certain window you will see that happy
-couple enjoying their honeymoon here in
Bermuda." This I said by way of illustrating the interest of Canadians in the married
lives of our people. Senator and Mrs. Lacasse
proved very pleasant companions: they
endeared themselves not only to their Canadian associates but to the delegates from the
other parts of the Empire. As the only
bilingual members, they aroused a good deal

of interest, especially among those who
attended from the United Kingdom, the United
Statc

, Australa

and

N

Zealand.

We

Cana-

dians who speak English, and this gentleman
and his wife who spoke French, got along as
though all of us spoke only one and the same
language. It was a meeting of which I retain
very happy recollections. When I heard of
the senator's illness, and later, through the
press, of his death, I felt that I would like
to recall to his former associates here what
a pleasant companion he was, and how, in
his social contacts away from home, he
embodied and manifested the spirit of that
bilingualism of which we as Canadians are
so proud.

Let me now speak, although briefly, of
the late Senator David, whom I have known
ever since, but not before, he came to this
house. If a somewhat intimate allusion may
be allowed, I would recall that one day he
came to me and said, "Haig, are you interested in history?" I replied, "Very much."
He then told me of his project so to revise
the story of Canada as to show the true
history of the early days of the people of New
France and of the Canadians in general.
He added that he hoped to have the aid of
someone who was absolutely unprejudiced
in publicizing the subject through the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
For two
months it was my very pleasant experience
to collaborate with him for this purpose. I
found him broadminded, sympathetic, and
well informed on the problems of our country, to an extent unequalled among my
acquaintances from any other province. As
a Canadian, I would voice my appreciation
of the contribution that he, and men like him,
have made to our nation, in presenting the
facts of history, not as something put in a
book, but as a vivid and authentic description of the early days of our country.
On behalf of all members of this bouse I
would extend to Mrs. Lacasse and the late
senator's family, and to the widow and family
of the late Senator David, our very sincere
sympathy. May they always have in remembrance the fine public services which our late
distinguished colleagues rendered in this
house.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
(Translation):
Hon. Leon Mercier Gouin: Honourable
senators, it may be said of my very dear
friend, senator Gustave Lacasse, that he spent
his life in good works. He was born in the
country, like so many of our best public men.
From his native village in the district of
Joliette, he came to study in the metropolis
of Montreal, first at the College of Montreal,
then at the medical faculty of our former
Laval University. He became a doctor in

FEBRUARY 4, 1953
1915. He was an honour to bis profession
as well as to his race. His devotion to bis
compatriots in the Essex area has remained
proverbial. Gustave Lacasse was a man of
heart: he was endowed with a remarkable
social sense. Deeply attached to our family
traditions, he had eleven children. He was
a good husband and an excellent father. As
mayor of his good city of Tecumseh, chairman
of the separate school board, officer of various
medical associations, director of the Artisans,
of the Sauvegarde and of various mutual life
insurance companies, president of the Saint
Jean Baptiste Society, director of FrenchCanadian education associations in his adopted
province and chief editor of bis own newspaper, La Feuille d'Erable, senator Gustave
Lacasse was truly a leader among Frenchspeaking citizens of Ontario.
An ardent
patriot, he devoted himself unceasingly to
the defence of bis people's rights and to the
help of all, in bis professional as well as his
public life.
He leaves the imperishable memory of a
good man, of a patriot, of a good servant of
the people, of a moving spirit of fruitful and
benevolent efforts, of a practical sociologist,
of an apostle of social action and, above all,
of a great Christian.
To the family and to the associates of our
lamented colleague, I extend my very deepest
sympathy.
As for Athanase David, his father was
Senator Laurent Olivier David, the closest
friend, I believe, of Sir Wilfrid Laurier and
also a great friend of Honoré Mercier. The
man whose panegyric we are making today
had the same godmother as I: Honoré Mercier's second wife. The patriotism of this
French-Canadian leader was always an
inspiration to Athanase David. Like Mercier,
he was educated at St. Mary's College. One
of his companions was Honoré Mercier II,
who was to be a .colleague of is for many
years in Sir Lomer Gouin's provincial government.
Admitted to the Bar at the beginning of
the 20th century, our lamented colleague was
a brilliant lawyer. He was a master of the
word in all its forms. The first time I
applauded Athanase David, he was playing
the part of Staforel in Edmond Rostand's
Les romanesques. I mention the fact because bis very real artistic talent helped
Athanase David to become in our province a
great minister of fine arts. He gave to the
pursuit of beauty in ail its fields-theatre,
music, painting, sculpture, literature-a magnificent development, unknown until then.
The creation of the David Prize would be
sufficient to preserve his memory for ever.
68112-13

He was elected nember for Terrebonne
in 1916, named provincial secretary three
years later and made bis mark while very
young because of bis personality and of bis
exceptional gifts. He was an intellectual in
the full meaning of the word, an aristocrat
of the mind. He advocated with great eloquence the theory of intellectual superiority.
That doctrine was to leave its mark on all
the men of our generation; it was first given
expression in Quebec by my very dear master,
Edouard Montpetit, who carried out, in the
university field, achievements parallel to
those of Athanase David. Edouard Montpetit
remains for us the incomparable professor,
whose disciples we all consider ourselves to
be and whose work we have resolved to
continue. Therefore, I could hardly do better
than to repeat the praise which Mr. Montpetit
rendered one day, as secretary general of is
beloved University of Montreal, to the companion of bis youth. In 1937, Mr. Edouard
Montpetit said to bis friend David: "You
have ardently defended the cause of education and, what is more, you have brought it
to victory, because you have used with intelligence the powers at your disposal."
Our whole system of education bas profited
by the enlightened and generous measures
taken by Athanase David. The people of
Quebec will never forget, either, is courageous
and beneficial action on behalf of its hospitals
and sanatoria. Athanase David fought tuberculosis and infantile mortality with an
admirable zeal.
He fought ignorance and disease, fanaticism
and prejudice. His patriotism was as broad
as our country is wide; he was a superb
example of Canada's French-speaking culture.
I extend my deepest sympathy to bis family. In mind I kneel before the freshly dug
grave of my friend, up there in the north
country. Faithful to his Laurentians he had
loved so deeply and praised so highly,
Athanase David asked that he be laid to rest
in the cemetery of Ste. Agathe, in the
heart of bis constituency.
Would that
the north wind could waft to him in the
mountains he loved so dearly this most imperfect but deeply felt praise which springs
from my own friendship and from the high
regard of a whole people.

Hon. Aristide Blais: Honourable senators,
the sudden departure from our midst of
Senator Gustave Lacasse bas been a stunning
blow to us all. Just two days before bis
fatal attack he came to my room to have one
of our usual frequent chats. At that time
I commented on his serene look and healthy
appearance, and bis spirits were high as
he anticipated a prosperous New Year. What
infinitesimal things we are before the Eternall

SENATE
The successive passing of some of our colleagues reminds us that tomorrow it may be
ouï

turn

to preparc

for the

Grand Voyage.

Let us beg the Almighty to give us fortitude
for that moment.
As everyone knows, Senator Lacasse hid
a most noble and generous heart behind his
stern appearance and bushy red eyebrows.
Sometimes even his voice took on a frightening tone, but those of us who knew him well
were aware that this was only a manifestation of the intensity of his sentiments and
the importance of the cause he was defending.
Senator Lacasse was a courageous fighter who
maintained vigilant guard at Windsor against
any infringement of the school and language
rights of his fellow French Canadians. He
was a talented journalist, whose newspaper
La Feuille d'Erable was the product of his
mind. It was a medium through which he
advocated the welfare of his compatriots and
defended their rights.
In the medical profession, of which I am
a member, Senator Lacasse was regarded as
a distinguished physician, a true example of
a country doctor. Untiring, generous and
devoted to is community. he was always very
obliging and ready for any emergency. But
what is not known except by his close friends
is that he was a poet of great inspiration
who wrote some beautiful poems. The one
which appeared in La Feuille d'Erable the
day after his funeral depicts the man and
gives the real measure of the colleague we
are now mournrng.
Honourable sentators, to lament the loss of
such a dear colleague as the late Senator
David and to extol his great qualities would
take a long time. I would beg you, however, to listen to a few more words of
sorrow from one who had the privilege of
sharing his room when he was first called
to this chamber, and of listening to his
conversation at.intervals during a whole year.
His esteem for and interest in my chosen profession made him the dearer to me. More
than once I heard him praise the art of medicine as one of the finest gifts of God. Like
many literary men-like Balzac, Bourget, and
others-he enjoyed reading about the early
history of medicine, and he cultivated the
friendship of some of the most learned physicians in Montreal.
I believe this natural
inclination towards the medical profession
had much to do with the vocational choice
made by his son Paul, who today is reputed to
be one of the best cardiologists in Montreal.
Senator David possessed one of those bright
minds that naturally radiate enlightenment.
Everything about him was pleasing and commanded admiration: the bearing and courtesy
of a gentleman; the charming conversation
that always sparkled with fine anecdotes;

the splendid erudition that led him into many
fields of activity. He was particularly active
in the fiel1 of education. and gave great
impetus to raising the standard of teaching
in all branches of learning in his native province of Quebec.
But be shone especially as an orator, and
his intellect, heart and soul were constantly
at the command of a beautiful voice and a
splendid diction, which be had mastered in
both English and French. It was a pity that
such an ailment as asthma, from which he
suffered intensely, prevented him on many
occasions from taking part in important discussions in this chamber.
I need not enlarge upon his achievements.
Previous speakers have already described
them better than I could do.
Senator David is no more. His vacant desk
causes me deep sorrow, and his departure is
a tremendous loss to us all. God bless his
soul.
(Translation):
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable senators, death has lately been reaping victims
in our ranks at an alarming rate. During
the last three years, one senator out of every
five who sat in this chamber bas passed
on, and since the last adjournment we have
lost two more.
Senator Gustave Lacasse, who was one of
the deans of the Senate,-he had been sitting
here for nearly twenty-five years-was, however, one of our younger members, since
death overtook him at barely sixty-two years
of age.
On the eve of December 17 last, as I
was leaving the Parliamentary restaurant, I
remember, I met our colleague coming
in for his meal. I inquired about his health
and be replied that he was not feeling well,
that he felt distressed and that his condition
worried him. The next day I heard that a
stroke had carried him away.
Anyone who came in contact with our
colleague could see that he had a fiery temperament and an overflowing vitality. Constantly busy, always moving, he could not
stop. When I worked late in my office, whatever the time, senator Lacasse was sure to
be still at work. One would be tempted to
say that overwork killed him. He would
certainly have lived longer had he been more
sparing of himself. But, had he spared himself, would he have helped his people as
he did, would be have been the leader and
the educator that we knew?
He also
defended stubbornly whatever was connected
with French survival in Canada. And in
order to better develop and spread his ideas,
he founded three newspapers, one of which,
La Feuille d'Erable is still being published.

FEBRUARY 4, 1953
He devoted himself particularly to this newspaper for more than fifteen years with all
his energy, in order to assert the interests
and rights of his compatriots.
Senator Lacasse belonged to a class of
doctors who were much more common in
olden days, when medicine was a sacred
calling. Not very long ago, he told me of
the calls he made, night and day, to look
after the sick. A proof of the medical ability
of our colleague is that he was for a time
president of the Ontario Medical Health
Officers Association.
What stands out in the extraordinary active
life of Senator Lacasse is his great devotion
to the survival of the French culture in
Canada, his great care to ensure stability
and better harmony between the two main
racial groups of the Canadian nation.
The people of Canada, and more especially
the French Canadians, will never forget what
Senator Lacasse has done for his country.
May I be permitted to conclude with a few
verses written by our colleague on January
21, 1946, on the occasion of the fifteenth
anniversary of his newspaper, La Feuille
d'Erable. These lines indicate that he had
indeed a great heart, a noble soul and lofty
ambitions.
O fille de mon rêve, enfant de ma pensée,
Depuis déjà quinze ans tu sonnes le réveil.
Tu poursuis sans faiblir la tâche commencée,
Réclamant pour les tiens une place au soleil.
Vaillante championne et servante fidèle
Du Droit, de la Justice et de la Vérité,
Tu connus bien souvent la morsure cruelle
Qu'infligent le.mensonge et l'animosité.
Demain tu déploieras plus largement tes ailes,
Agile messagère au pied souple et léger,
Et tu t'élanceras vers des sphères nouvelles,
Afin de faire à tous tes bienfaits partager.
D'autres auront alors, dans ma main frémissante,
Cueilli la plume usée au service des miens...
Que leur foi rajeunie et toujours grandissante
Poursuive noblement les travaux des anciens.
Qu'à la voix du passé ils demeurent dociles
Et qu'avec confiance ils gardent l'avenir,
Sans jamais reculer aux heures difficiles:
MOURIR AVEC HONNEUR PLUTÔT QUE DE
[TRAHIR.

I wish to extend to his affiicted family my
most sincere condolences.
Senator Lacasse had barely been laid to
rest a few days, when we heard over the
radio that another one of our colleagues,
Senator Athanase David, had passed away.
Senator David, who was descended from
illustrious ancestry, was bound, in his turn,
to become illustrious. He was the son of
L. O. David, a newspaperman, the historian
and intimate friend of Sir Wilfrid Laurier,

who was clerk of the City of Montreal and
became a senator like his son. His mother's
name was Albina Chenet.
Senator Athanase David was born on June
24, 1882, in Montreal. His godfather was
Baron Athanase de Charette, the French
general who covered himself with glory at
the head of the pontifical zouaves in 1870.
I will only recall a few outstanding points
in the life of our lamented colleague.
Senator David was educated -at Mount St.
Louis and at St. Mary's College, and admitted
to the Bar in 1905. In 1916 he was a successful candidate in the provincial elections in
the constituency of Terrebonne. After that
he was elected every time he stood as a
candidate.
It was on November 7, 1916, that he
entered the legislative assembly. His first
speech on education dazzled everyone, so
much so that he was sought on all sides as a
lecturer and orator. He handled words like
an academician and when he spoke, both his
language and his delivery aroused the
greatest enthusiasm.
This great orator, however, was also a
realist. When he was appointed provincial
secretary, in 1919, he drafted the first public
assistance law and also organized health services in most of our hospitals. He was also
responsible for creating the first public health
centres in the province of Quebec-the first,
I believe, to be set up as such in the whole
country.
He also founded the public archives of the
province of Quebec, engaged in the fight
against tuberculosis and infantile mortality,
organized family employment offices, holiday
camps and schools of fine arts, and established
scholarships which allowed the beneficiaries
to study in Europe. It was also during his
terni that the provincial museum of Quebec
was built. It was he, again, who founded the
Prix David for letters and sciences, a prize
which the people still call by the name of its
founder although it has officially received
another name. He gave all his co-operation
to the classical colleges and universities;
he organized anti-tubercular dispensaries, and
the lectures of l'Institut scientifique francocanadien . . .
Education and public health were his two
greatest concerns, the two difficult problems
to which he devoted his whole life.
In the Senate, to which he was called on
February 9, 1940, Senator David has left his
mark. Everyone remembers his motion for
a Canadian history text-book that would
teach the history of Canada more completely
and more impartially.

SENATE
Quebeekers remember with pride that they

It was in recognition of all these cultural
achievements
that Senator David was
awarded in 1926 the decoration of Officier
de la Légion d'honneur.
The honourable Onésime Gagnon, the
present minister of Finance for the province
of Quebec, once said of our colleague: "The
foes as well as the friends of the honourable
Mr. David recognize not only the great contribution he has made to the cause of education, but also the great part he has played
in the fight against tuberculosis."
In 1934 the then secretary general of
the University of Montreal, Mr. Edouard
Montpetit, also paid our colleague this great
tribute: "You have ardently defended the
cause of education and, what is more, you
have brought it to victory, because you have
used with intelligence the powers at your
disposai." And Mr. Edouard Montpetit added
at the end: "Truly, nothing is more to your
credit than to have understood the situation."
Our colleague was a realist, and at his
age he laboured under no illusions. Last
November I had the honour to propose the
Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne, and he wrote to me the next day a
note which I shall keep among my most
precious papers: "As I arrived in Ottawa
yesterday at five o'clock, I missed your speech.
But I have just read it. The more I think
over it, the more I feel that you said the
right things. The satisfaction which you will
feel at having expressed them will compensate for the little publicity accorded to
Senate speeches."
I join with my colleagues in offering to the
families of Senator Lacasse and Senator
David the tribute of our deep gratitude and
of our unfailing memory.
(Translation):
Hon. Paul Henri Bouffard: Honourable
senators, perhaps you will permit two representatives of Quebec to recall the memory
of a dear colleague, the late Senator David.
Senator David, who was born and lived in
Montreal, has left enduring memories in
Quebec city where, as a member of the
provincial legislature and a minister in
the cabinet, he grew in stature and gave the
best of himself. Member of a family which
had long taken an active interest in politics,
he himself became politically-minded, and
from the outset he proved the man best
fitted to direct education in the province
during nearly a quarter of a century.

Patron of the arts and a friend of letters,
he developed education in Quebec and instilled in our youth a spirit and ambition
which they had not known in years.
I met him when nationalism was somewhat
the rage. At sixteen, one could not but admire
what he held so close to his heart: the love
of his French-speaking compatriots.
When I heard Senator David for the first
time I realized that he was profoundly
devoted to his countrymen. After a period of
pronounced nationalism, he advocated principles which, though they were not new by
then, nevertheless interested our youth. He
advocated a healthy nationalism and unity,
and although he showed that attachment
to our race is born in us, he also stressed
that Canada could not prosper without unity
amongst all Canadians, and that Canadians
of all origins should make a common effort
for the advancement of our country through
their love for Canada and their education.
By his forceful eloquence, his artistic temperament, his refined culture, he drew French
Canadian youth towards that brand of
nationalism which is at present, as David advocated twenty-five years ago, directed to
the unity of Canada, and tends to contribute
to the union of races and to the respect they
should have for one another.
Senator David, by his attachment to his
country and his propensity for Canadian
unity, will always remain in our memory.
I wish to express to the members of his
family, whom I know very well, my deep
admiration for the work Senator David
accomplished during the years in which he
took part in Canadian politics and especially
in the political life of the province of Quebec.
He was one of those who by their eloquence,
their deep convictions, have instilled in our
youth the love of Canada and that unity which
is essential to the greatness of our country.
I did not know Senator Lacasse as well.
I only met him since my appointment to the
Senate. He struck me as a very sympathetie
man. He was very kind to all who knew
him. He went out of his way to encourage

Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Honourable senators,
on behalf -of the honourable senator from
Rockcliffe (Hon. Mrs. Wilson), and with
leave of the Senate, I beg to move:
That the Standing Committee on Immigration
and Labour be authorized and directed to examine
into the Immigration Act (R.S.C. Chapter 93 and
its operation and administration
Amendments),
and the circumstances and conditions relating
thereto including:
(a) the desirability of admitting immigrants to
Canada,
(b) the type of immigrant which should be preferred, including origin, training and other characteristics,
(c) the availability of such immigrants for
admission,
(d) the facilities, resources
and capacity of
Canada to absorb, employ and maintain such
immigrants, and
(e) the appropriate terms and conditions of
such admission;
And that the said committee report its findings
to this house;
And that the said committee have power to send
for persons, papers and records.

Further, on behalf of the honourable senator from Rockcliffe, I would suggest that
this committee be asked to meet Tuesday
morning next.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, is it your pleasure to adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I think the proper procedure would be to
regard this as a notice of motion.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Before it is accepted as a
notice of motion I should like to call the
attention of His Honour the Speaker to the
fact that we have a standing committee on
immigration, and thatThe Hon. the Speaker: With leave of the
Senate, it can be taken as a notice of motion
to be considered on Tuesday next.
Hon. Mr. Haig: On a point of order, Mr.
Speaker, I believe that the committee should
first be asked to meet and decide whether
it wants to have this motion passed. If the
committee meets and opposes the motion,
any member of the committee can come back
to the house and seek to have the motion
passed, overriding the will of the committee.
But as no emergency seems to exist, I can
see no reason for asking the house to override the committee at this time. Though I
am a member of the committee I have
received no notice of a meeting to consider
this motion, and I feel I should have a chance
to consider it before it is presented to the
house.
I suggest that the honourable member from
Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon) withdraw the
motion and call a meeting of the committee

FEBRUARY 5, 1953
for Tuesday next, when the motion can be
considered. If it is received with favour,
then everything wili be in order, and in any
event the motion couid then be presented

The Han. the Speaker: Honourabie senators, the point raised by the honourable
leader opposite is weli taken, but the motion
was made with leave of the Senate.
Han. Mr. Haig: I did flot consent, Mr.
Speaker.
The Han. the Speaker: As there is an

BILL

THIRD READING

Han. A. K. Hugessen moved the third reading of Bill A-1, an Act ta incorporate the
Mercantile Bank af Canada.
Hon. R. B. Harner: Honourable senators,
in view of the fact that quite a number of
senators were unable ta, attend the meeting
of the Banking and Commerce Cammittee
at which this bill was considered, and the
heads of four different banks, ail of whom
were apposed to it, were heard, and as I
personaily abject ta it being passed hurriedly,
I wish ta make a few mare remarks in connection with the proposai ta, grant; a charter
ta the Mercantile Bank of Canada. One
thing which rather amused me was the frequent répétition by same honourable senators
that refusai ta, grant this charter wauid offend
their "liberai" minds. Being, of course, anly
a wicked Conservative, I am still anxious
ta, conserve for Canadians the resources and
the weaith of Canada. In saying this I do
flot wish ta be misunderstood as was the late
68112-14

Sir Robert Borden, against whom, after he
made some remark of this kind a whispering
campaign was directed throughout Canada
ta the effect that he had said that nobody
who was nat born in this country would be
allowed ta stay here. I just wonder what
is the thought behind the sponsarship of this
bill. First, be it noted, we are granting an
immense concession. I hesitate ta dweil an
this point in the presence o! men aider and
with greater experience in the banking field.
I know how much those who have heid bank
stocks over the past fifty years have profited
by the present system, and I admit ta, having
made remarks on one occasion which were
rather bitteriy critical of aur banking institutions. Nevertheless, those who have done a
littie travelling realize-and I, among them.what a fine banking system. we have. The
statement has been made that ours is the
finest banking systemi in the world. If one
has occasion ta change money in Halifax, one
gets the same rate o! exchange as could be
had for it in Vancouver. You can go inta
any one of aur branch banks anywhere and
have your needs attended ta in that way.
But if you visit France or Beigium and go
into one bank you may find that the rate of
exchange is different from that of another
bank just down the street; and the situation
becomes very confusing.
I believe in reciprocity, but there is no
comparable gif t that the Netherlands can
make ta aur banks in return for the very
great gift we wouid be making. To my
way of thinking we would be giving away
several million dollars, which is the value that
I place on a bank charter that would grant
these people the right to operate in this
country through a head office and branches.
This thing rather amazes me. Great emphasis
was laid on what could be dane with tis
capital investment of $1J million. I notice
the honourabie senatar from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler) shaking bis head. Tis was supposed ta be new money, but I wouid point
out that there are billions of dollars lylng
in the banks in tis
country.
Everyone
knows that when the Interprovincial pipeline
was built it was anticipated that huge dividends would be paid, and certainiy one dollar
invested then is worth eight dollars taday.
The "liberal" attitude at that time was:
"Don't say a word. The terminal for this
pipeline wiil have ta, be located in Superior,
Wisconsin, because we need American money
ta deveiop this pipeline, which is going ta
cost a lot of money." As a resuit of that attitude aniy a few favoured Canadians were
given a chance ta buy any o! the stock. A
great heritage was just given away.
And what about the Trans-Mountain pipeline? How many Canadians got a chance to,

SENATE
buy any of that company's stock? One
American made so much money buying shares
at $10 each that he was not even annoyed
when a certain lady stole $2 million from
him. He had made just about that much
money on a purely Canadian pipeline. American capital was brought in for that undertaking, and it seems to me that we persist in
this sort of thing to an extreme that is
uncalled for.
The bankers
explained
to us that Canadian banks are not allowed
to take on deposit one dollar in the United
States. You cannot even hold a job worthwhile over there without becoming an American citizen. Yet we have followed this
"liberal-minded" policy of sitting back and
letting foreign investment take over.
I want to emphasize that no banker, politician, or anyone else has asked me to take
this stand. I am saying only what I think,
as a private Canadian citizen and as a member
of this chamber. I am not discourteous or
selfish in this attitude; it is simply that I conscientiously believe that if we pass this bill
we shall be making a great mistake. Bankers
have assured us that it is utter nonsense to
argue that sort of legislation is necessary in
order to provide for the requirements of
Canadian trade in the Far East. Our Canadian banks have agents throughout the world,
and there is no legitimate trade anywhere
that they are not prepared to meet.
In the past such communities as Yellowknife have been developed to a great extent
by the establishment of chartered bank
branches. Sometimes, when the amount of
business would seem to warrant it, a bank
would establish two branches in a certain
town, but perhaps later on it would be found
necessary to close one of them. As I understand it, Canadian bankers are afraid that
the proposed new bank would establish
branches only in populous centres. They
complain that as a result our chartered banks
would be deprived of business which is helping them to recoup some of the losses they
have suffered in smaller communities. Those
of us from the western provinces certainly
know how well the banks have served small
communities out there.
Canadians can be proud of the fact that
there is a uniform rate of exchange all across
this country, from Halifax to Vancouver. We
have ten chartered banks in Canada at the
present time, and, as has been pointed out,
they are willing and able to take care of any
demand made upon them. Everybody knows
that competition is all right up to a certain
point, but nearly every community believes
it will be better served by licensing only one
organization to perform some specific public
service.

Other honourable senators are more capable
of discussing the details of this bill than I am.

Cil
I now move that this
the third time but that it be read a third
time six months hence.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Who is going to second your
motion?
Hon. Mr. Quinn: I will second the motion.
The Hon. ihe Speaker: I would advise the
honourable senator from Blaine Lake (Hon.
Mr. Horner) that I must have the motion
handed to me in writing.
Honourable senators, it is moved by the
Honourable Senator Hugessen, seconded by
the Honourable Senator Fafard, that Bill A-1,
intituled "An Act to incorporate the Mercantile Bank of Canada", be now read the
third time. In amendment it is moved by
the Honourable Senator Horner, seconded by
the Honourable Senator Quinn, that the word
"now" be left out and the words "this day
six months" be added at the end of the
motion. Is it your pleasure to adopt the
amendment?
Hon. Felix P. Quinn: Honourable members,
there are times when I do not agree with
the statements made by my deskmate, the
honourable senator from Blaine Lake (Hon.
Mr. Horner). I could particularize by reminding the house of an incident which occurred
on the second last day of our sittings before
the Christmas adjournment, when he commented upon the separate school question.
His remarks at that time hurt me very much,
and I could see no reason or justification for
their being introduced into the debate on
the Speech from the Throne.
After that slap on the wrist of my deskmate, I should like to say a few words about
the measure now before us.
As a member of the Banking and Commerce Committee, I listened to the opinions
expressed by the leading bankers of this
country on the quality of our banking system.
It is, of course, the best in the whole world.
The president of one of the chartered banks
said further that the service of the Canadian
banks was unequalled anywhere. Canada,
we were told, has a bank for approximately
every 3,000 people.
The question was asked in committee
whether our banking system would be
adequate if the population of this country
continued to grow until it reached, say, 25
million. The answer was that there was
plenty of room for expansion. One often
hears it said: competition does not hurt; competition is a good thing; competition is the
life of trade. I agree with all that, but with
a banking system unequalled elsewhere and

FEBRUARY 5, 1953
capable of developing with the growth of our
country, why should we discourage the men
who have built up that system and made it
so successful? I think every encouragement
should be given to them to develop without
competition from a foreign bank.
For the reasons I have given, I am against
the establishment in Canada of the proposed
new bank with its relatively small amount
of capital, and I support the amendment of
my friend fom Blaine Lake.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
as the original sponsor of this bill in the
Senate, I should perhaps make a few observations on the two speeches to which we have
just listened.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask the honourable
senator if his remarks will -close the debate?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I did not move the
amendment, so I will not close the debate
on it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: You are speaking on the
amendment?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes, I am speaking on
the amendment.
For the information of honourable senators
who did not attqnd the meetings of the Banking and Commerce Committee, I should perhaps say that this bill received very serious
and lengthy consideration in that committee.
We held two long sittings, in the course of
which we listened to a number of witnesses
from the present chartered banks, and also
to Mr. Graham Towers, President of the Bank
of Canada.
Honourable senators will have learned
from their morning papers that Mr. Towers
expressed to us the view that it would be
a good thing to encourage a new bank in this
country, and that it would have no evil effect
upon the banking system or upon the present
banks. Following the lengthy and exhaustive
discussion, the committee voted 16 to 4 to
report the bill back to the house.
I agree wholeheartedly with one or two of
the remarks made by both the honourable
senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner)
and the honourable senator from Halifax
(Hon. Mr. Quinn), namely, that we have in
this country one of the best, if not the best,
banking systems in the world; and I am
quite sure that I speak for every honourable
senator when I say that no one in this house
would voluntarily do anything that would
weaken that system.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: But I ask my honourable friends to have a little sense of proportion. Having in mind the hundreds of millions of dollars already invested in the capital
68112-14J

of our banks, and the thousands of millions
of dollars deposited in the banks by the
people of Canada, do my honourable friends
really think that the bill now before us would
weaken the banking system of Canada? We
are being asked to pass a bill for a new bank
with an authorized capital of only $3 million,
of which $1j million is to be paid up. I ask
honourable senators, in afl conscience, how
in the world could a bill of this kind
prejudicially affect the banking system of
this country?
Hon. Mr. Paterson: May I interrupt the
honourable gentleman to ask him a question?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: If we grant this
applicant's request, how in the world are we
going to refuse charters to other applicants?
Hon. Mr. Horner: That is the question.
Hon. Mr. Euler: It is very easily answered.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: My honourable friend
from Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr. Paterson) has
asked a most pertinent question, and I shall
answer him in this way: The parliament of
Canada has to assume its own responsibility.
Parliament may pass any bill which seeks the
incorporation of a new bank, but if at any
time it considered that more banks were
seeking incorporation than the economy of
the country could support, or that to incorporate more would be harmful to the present
banking system, I am quite sure that parliament would accept its responsibility and
refuse to grant a new charter.
My honourable friend from Blaine Lake
said that if we adopt this bill we are making
to the incorporators a gift which he estimated
at several million dollars. The practical
bankers who appeared before the committee
yesterday told us precisely the reverse. They
said that it was ridiculous to start in this
country a new bank with a capital of only
a million and a half dollars: they thought the
money would be very quickly lost.
In fact, are we making a gift? All we are
doing is following the practice laid down
in the Bank Act for people who apply for
the incorporation of a bank; and, so far from
our making a gift to these incorporators,
they are proposing to bring to this country in
support of their project a million and a half
dollars of good money. I ask my honourable
friends what possible objection can there be
to having outside capital brought into this
country for banking purposes, any more than
for the support of our oil industry, or our
mining industries, or any other of the great
number of industries in this country which
are supported by capital from abroad?

SENATE
My honourable friend made some critical
observations about the "liberal mind." Someimes

I

find

difficulty

In

under4standing

the

tortuous meanderings of the Tory mind. What
is Canada's present position? There are in
this country ten chartered banks, doing a
very admirable job. The country however
is developing very rapidly-in population, in
resources, in manufacturing industries, and
in every other way. Is anybody going to
tell me-what the remarks of the honourable
senator from Bedford-Halifax (Hon. Mr.
Quinn) would seem to imply-that under no
circumstances should we incorporate a new
bank, but that the present ten chartered
banks are always to be regarded as sufficient for the people of this country? My
answer to my honourable friend is simple
enough; Parliament has decided otherwise,
and has set out, in the Bank Act, provisions
under which applicants may, if they prove
themselves to be worthy of it, obtain a
charter for a new bank. That is what the
present applicants have done. We in committee inquired at some length as to their
good standing. If this bill is passed, what
will happen is that a group of highly experienced Netherlands bankers, with a fund
of many years' experience in banking, particularly in the Far East, will open a bank
in this country with a small initial capital
and will give this country the benefit of the
experience they have thus gained.
Needless to say, I shall have to vote against
the amendment of the honourable senator
from Blaine Lake.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
until I entered the chamber a few minutes
ago I did not know that this amendment was
being moved. So that there shall be no misunderstanding, I want to add that the honourable senator was under no obligation
before he moved his amendment to consult
with me or anybody else, and I may add
that what he has moved is in line with his
action in the committee. He opposed the
bill in committee, he voted against it, and
he put forth at that time many of the arguments he has repeated today, and with which
I entirely agree. When I was discussing the
matter with my colleague the senator from
Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) he asked, "Well,
how did you and the senator from Blaine
Lake vote?" When I replied that we voted
the same way, he thought that both of us
must be wrong.
It is reassuring to hear that we have a very
fine banking system. Probably we have the
best in the world, but that fact is due in part,
if not wholly, to the provisions of the Bank
Act. From its very beginning the statute has
contained a provision that a bank cannot lend

its money on mortgages. I know that in
some cases advances have been made on
mortgages,

but

only

wrherp

n

deht

was

incurred and had become overdue, in respect
of grain, cattle, sugar and some other commodities. By section 88 of the act it is
permissible to make advances on ordinary
real estate mortgages on farms and some
urban property. I believe that the limitations
prescribed by the act in this respect are the
secret of the success of our banking system.
Before the committee, Mr. Muir, President of
the Royal Bank of Canada, read a provision
in the charter of this Netherlands company
that this limitation will not apply to their
business in the Far East. They have warebouses and places of business there, and
undoubtedly they want to establish in Canada
an organization whereby business can be
directed to those trading institutions.
In this connection I am reminded of the
activities in which the honourable senator
from Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr. Paterson)
and the honourable senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) have engaged for many
years. They are experienced in the grain
business. They or their companies owned
or controlled elevators ail over Manitoba,
Saskatchewan and Alberta. It may be that
the purpose of these rural elevators was to
provide the farmer with facilities for the
handling of his grain from his wagon or
truck to the railroad cars, but I am persuaded that the main reason ýof the companies for having country elevators was to
get business to their Fort William terminals
or their Vancouver terminals, or both. It
may be that some companies which operate
country elevators do not have terminals, but
it is well known that organizations such as
the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, which at first
were mainly concerned with country elevators, acquired terminals to handle the grain
delivered to them. The promoters of the
proposed bank are in a somewhat similar
position. According to Mr. Muir, their institutions in the Far East are trading concerns,
and that is a form of banking activity upon
which we in this country have never looked
with favour.
As some of us pointed out in committee, the
Bank Act will be due for revision next year,
at the end of the regular ten-year period.
Between now and then there may be an
election. The same government, or another,
may be returned, or there may be no election
at all. But whatever government will then
hold office I am persuaded that it will try
to have the act so amended and improved
as to protect as far as possible the depositors
of money in our banks. .

FEBRUARY 5, 1953

Some of us suggested that this bill should
be deferred until after the revision of the
Bank Act had made it clear what amendments the government of the day will decide
upon. I do not think that that is a very
drastic proposal. The world has been going
on for quite a while, and the bank concerned
has been in business for a long time. As to
its purpose to obtain deposits here to finance
its business in the Far East, I am not in favour
of it.
In committee I asked Mr. Towers a question and I noticed he did not answer me
directly. I asked: "When the Royal Bank of
Canada or the Canadian Bank of Commerce
or the Bank of Nova Scotia is making a loan
can you tell whether it is a good or bad one?"
He replied, "Well, our inspectors will catch
it". I said, "They may catch it a few weeks
or months after the loan is made, but they
won't catch it at the time." I happen to
know a little about the borrowing end of a
bank's business, and I know it is a difficult
job to get money from a bank. First of
all, the banks depend on their local branch
managers, and then on their district superintendents. And should the application for
a loan reach the head office, it will depend
on one person's opinion whether the loan
will be made. The questions that will be
asked will be along this line: "Did he fulfil
his obligations in the past when he borrowed,
say, $100? Did he get into difficulties?" No
bank inspection can catch this sort of thing.
Bank inspections entail a lot of work. I
know an auditor who covers Manitoba,
Saskatchewan, and Alberta for a certain bank.
Whenever he makes an inspection tour he is
away from his home for at least three weeks,
and even his wife will have no idea where
he is going. He will spend a week in a place
like Dauphin, Manitoba, or Regina or Kerrobert or Kindersley in Saskatchewan. When
he calls on a bank manager he knocks on the
bank door at half-past three or four o'clock
in the afternoon, saying that it is Mr. So-andso from Winnipeg. He does not carry any
identification card, but he has a badge which
shows that he is a bank inspector. The bank's
business having been finished for the day, he
has the bank locked up while he and his men
go through the institution from top to bottom. Following his inspection he reports his
findings to his head office in Winnipeg. My
point is that despite all this checking and
supervision, the banks are still not sure
whether they will get their money back when
loans fall due.
The chartered banks of Canada have been
both faithful and honest in following out the
instructions of the Bank of Canada. Furthermore, they have done a tremendous amount
of work for practically no remuneration.

Their handling of war bonds was a huge
undertaking,- and the small return they
received never began to repay them for the
cost of the work they did.
There is nothing to prevent this proposed
Mercantile Bank of Canada from lending
money to Canadians. And I am quite certain
it will try to induce its clients-as I would
do if I were running the bank-to invest
money with the bank's business connections
in the East Indies. That is one of the things
to which I object, and I maintain that legislation such as this should be looked into as
carefully as possible.
Banking is not a very profitable business.
There never has been any rush to buy shares
in a bank. We were told yesterday that
hardheaded businessmen from the Maritime
Provinces own 47 per cent of one banking
institution. It may be said that they were
wise to make such a good investment, but
why didn't the big moneymakers buy some
of that stock? Why is it that almost half the
stock is owned in those small provinces?
Maritimers are careful investors, but at the
sanie time they are not what you would caU
big moneymakers or big money hunters. I
like to make a little money myself, but I
have never owned any bank stock. I never
could see why a person who wanted to make
money fast would buy bank stock paying
dividends of 3 or 4 per cent. As a matter of
fact, I think in some instances it has been
as low as l per cent this year.
At the same time, I would emphasize that
our banks have given Canadians a service
second to none. What happened to the banks
in the great country to the south during the
period from 1930 to 1935? The door of bank
after bank was shut in the faces of depositors.
Hundreds of thousands of Americans lost
their life savings, but not a dollar was lost
in this way in Canada.
The honourable gentleman from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) has said that the proposed new bank would be only one more
bank in Canada. But are not our present
banks rendering a fine service to the poorer
class of people of this country? I am not
concerned about wealthy Canadians, those
who are worth $50,000 or $100,000 or more.
They can look after themselves. I am thinking of people who want to save, say, $25 or
$30 a month. There is not a safer place than
any one of our chartered banks for the
savings of small depositors. As a practising
lawyer in Winnipeg I am asked at least ten
times a month where small wage earners
can safely deposit amounts from $15 to $35
a month. I advise them to put their money
in a bank and, when they accumulate $100,
to buy a governinent bond. They ask me,

SENATE
"Will our money be safe in the bank?" and
I reply, "Well, I really don't know, but
money has been safe in Canadian banks for a
good many years now." I point out to them
that during the depression years our money
remained safe in our banks, and that whenever I want to save money I put it in a bank.
During all my life, which has been quite a
long one, I have never known depositors to
lose money in a Canadian bank, but I have
known people to lose money deposited with
loan companies, investment companies and
so on.

We have been told that this is a free
country and that if people from abroad want
to come in and establish a bank we should
let them. I would ask the bouse to remember
that a bank is not an ordinary commercial
enterprise. Banks are a part of the government institutions of this country. By statute
their lending capacity is under supervision of
the strictest kind. When the Right Honourable R. B. Bennett was Prime Minister of
this country he was responsible for the
establishment of the Bank of Canada. Half
of its stock was to be held by the public and
half by the government. But when Mr. King
became Prime Minister he brought down
legislation to provide that all of the stock
should be held by the government. I entirely
agree with that move. Banking institutions
are for the benefit of everybody, particularly
the small wage earners.
Neither before I became a member of this
chamber nor since have I ever heard anyone
ask that a new bank be established. I doubt
whether any senator bas heard any such
request. Has anyone in your town or city or
rural municipality said to you, "Mr. Aseltine,
Mr. Horner, Mr. Quinn, I wish you would
advocate that we establish another bank in
Canada?" I doubt it.
Honourable senators, for the reasons given
I think the amendment should be accepted
and the third reading of the bill postponed.
I do not believe that the Dutch bank will go
broke within a year.
It has been said that the bank proposes
to establish itself in Montreal and Vancouver,
for the obvious reason that it wants to get
the trade with the Orient. That business is
now handled by our Canadian banks. I think
it was Mr. Stewart of the Canadian Bank of
Commerce who told the committee that when
the war of 1914-18 broke out the New York
branch of his bank carried 12J per cent of
all the United States cotton trade in foreign
markets. It was also said that anyone who
wanted to buy stock in the new bank could
do so. Such a practice is not allowed in New

York state. There the Canadian Bank of
Commerce is not even permitted to take
deposits.
I plead with the house to accept this
amendment. No great harm can be done if
the proposed measure is delayed a year, and
in that time the government of the day will
have had a chance to outline its proposals
for changes in the Bank Act.
I share the apprehension of my honourable
friend from Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr. Paterson)
that the passage of this bill would create
a precedent, whether we wanted it to or not.
If after the Dutch bank comes in ten or
twenty banks from the United States make
application to establish branches in Toronto,
Calgary or wherever their biggest customers
are, how can we refuse them? In that connection I am about to say something which
may be bad politics, but I will say it anyway,
If we are going to remain free men and
women in this world we will have to look
more to the United States to back us up; and
we cannot afford to fight with them over
money matters. When the soldiers of that
great nation of 155 million people are shedding their blood on the battlefields of Korea,
and when it is spending millions of dollars
to support less fortunate countries, how
could we refuse its bankers a charter to start
a new bank in Canada? We simply could
not do it.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Why not shut out all the
other American institutions in this country?
Hon. Mr. Haig: But they are not banks.
People do not deposit their money in mercantile institutions like the Imperial Oil ComHarvester
pany and the International
Company. The question is one of protecting
the people's money. The experiences of
1933 proved that the American banking system could not stand up under adverse conditions, but that ours could. It is not a
question of whether the American bankers
are more honest or smarter than Canadian
bankers; it is purely a matter of the difference between the two systems. The American
system is bound to fail under certain
conditions.
I repeat that the point raised by my friend
frorn Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr. Paterson) was
well taken. We cannot pass this application and refuse another.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Of course we can.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But parliament will not
do it.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Of course it will.

FEBRUARY 5. 1853
Hon. Mr. Haig: We could no more refuse
another ýapplicant, if we pass this measure,
than we could jump off the bridge over the
Ottawa River.
Han. Mr. Euler: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Haig: After the passage of this
bil we could no0 more refuse an application
from a British bank to open a branch in
Canada, than we cou.ld jump off the tower of
this building. No more could we refuse an
application from a bank in the United States,
under similar circurnstances-and there
might be more reason for granting a charter
to it than to a British bank. An Axnerican
bank would have more capital than the proposed Dutch bank, and would be able to
help in the development of this country.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Will the honourable
gentleman tell us why we should refuse any
applicant?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I arn saying that the present banking systemi is working extremely
weil, and I see no reason why this matter
should, not stand in abeyance for a period o!
time. In that way we will have an opportunity to see what the government proposes to
have put in the Bank Act by way of protection for the people o! this country. If the
government o! the day decides that the act
should not prohibit the granting o! a charter
to a new bank, then, as far as the Bank Act
goes, the objection disappears.
I intend to vote for the amendinent, and
I. hope my fellow senators wiil do the samie.
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, this is a private bull, and I usually
refrain from participating in the debate on
such matters lest my remarks be taken to
indicate the attitude o! the government. I
have no intention of discussing now the
merits o! the bank seeking a new charter.
I rise now only on the amendment before
the house-that this measure be postponed
until some future date because, it has been
suggested, a government-sponsored amendment to the Bank Act either may remove
the objection held by the chartered banks
in Canada to the coming hn of new banks,
or prohibit their coming in.
I have no special knowledge on this subject, but.I seriously doubt that the government o! which I arn a member would deem
it desirable to introduoe amendments to
place around the existing baniting structure
a wall which would perpetuate that structure
for ail time, and give to the present chartered banks, no matter how good they may
be, complete monopoly o! the banking
business hn Canada.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Han. Mr. Robertson: I go further and say
that if such amendments were proposed, I
would most definitely oppose them.
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: If there is a general
election this year it will be for the public
to decide what they want the governiment
to do by way of amending the Bank Act.
I have no doubt my honourable friends opposite are hopeful that a government which
they would support wiil corne into office and
amend the Bank Act along the lunes that
have been suggested.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: God forbid.
Han. Mr. Robertson: I would suggest, if a
new government were elected, that it take a
second look at the situation before doing so.
That, however, would be its business, and
I would flot expect it to take my advice.
I merely wish to assure the house that as
far as my knowledge goes there is no likelihood that this government would initiate
such legisiation as my friends opposite
suggest.
Hon. J. Wesley Stambaugh: Honourable
senators, you have heard the opinion of a
western farmer with a Conservative mind;
possibly it will be in order to express the
opin-ion of a western fariner with a Liberal
mind.
In the first place, I should like to answer
the statement of the honourable leader of the
opposition (Hion. Mr. Haig) that there has
neyer been any demand for more banks. That
is not so as regards the province from which
I corne. About fifteen years ago the chartered banks closed a number o! their branches
in various parts o! Alberta, including five
points on our local lime of some seventy-five
miles. The demand for bank accommodation was su-eh that the present provincial
governinent has Put in a !orm of bank which
is called a treasury branch, and fi!ty o! these
branches are located at various points hn the
-province, most of them in places from which
the chartered banks have withdrawn. 0f
-course the reason for those withdrawals was
that at those particular points the banks
were not making a profit. I know that to
be the case, because I was a member of a
delegation which interviewed the head o! a
bank which had elosed three branches within a f ew miles of my town. Our delegation
was told they just were not making a profit,
and that was the reason they were being
closed. It was flot that the bank did flot
make an over-all profit. As a matter of
fact, anyone who bought almost any bank

SENATE
stocks ten years ago would have, if he held
them until today, a capital gain of about
100

pPr cent, and

hav

reiaved

nr wl1

annual dividend of about 4 per cent. To my
mind, those are very satisfactory profits. I
do not think we need to worry about the
banks not making a profit.
One of the reasons I am speaking today
is that in recent years-especially since numerous unprofitable branch banks were closed,
and the number of national banks has fallen
to ten or eleven, whereas formerly there were
nearly twice as many-I have noticed a
tendency towards a little too much co-operation and not enough competition.
Hon. Mr. Horner: May I ask a question?
The honourable senator will agree, in view
of the figures he has just quoted, that what
we are asked to give is a very valuable
concession.
Hon. Mr. S±ambaugh: I think the concession
will be valuable to the Canadian people, and
that they will gain by a little more competition. In my reference to the profits of the
banks I am not to be understood as saying
anything against them, and I have no personal complaint to make against them. I
agree with the honourable senator from
Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) in his statement that Canada today has what is probably the best banking system in the world,
but I do not suppose it is so good that it
could not be better; and I reiterate my feeling that we should have a little more competition and not quite so much co-operation.
If a man wants to change his bank he will
have no trouble at all provided he has a
healthy bank deposit, but if his object is to
borrow a little more money than his bank
will allow him he is likely to find, to whatever bank he goes, that it is able to get a
confidential report from the bank from which
he is withdrawing, so he is more or less
up against it.
I do not suppose that to grant this Mercantile Bank a charter will have much effect on
that situation, but I would like to see several
more banks in operation. It does not worry
me that to grant a charter to these people
may open the door to some other banks, for
I hope that others will come to Canada. 1
am very much in favour of the bill, and I
am opposed to the amendment.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
when this bill was before the house for
second reading I made some observations
upon it and gave it my blessing, for what my
blessing might be worth. In the opinions I
then expressed I was influenced by the
consideration that the establishment of this
bank might aid substantially in the development of our foreign trade, and especially that

which concerns the western part of Canada.
I am bound to say that the information we
ecure -il
nthe was
lore the committee convinced me that, so far as our
international trade is concerned, the new
bank will aid its promotion very little, if
at all. That conclusion disposed of the main
reason for speaking as I did on the motion
for second reading.
Let me say at once that I am not going
to oppose the third reading of this bill.
Yesterday, when unfortunately I was not
able to be present, the committee passed the
bill by a substantial majority, and it will
undoubtedly be passed by this house, for
the proposed six months' hoist which has been
moved by the honourable senator from Blaine
Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) is a wholly futile
gesture. However, I want to say a few things
about the bill.
I have grave misgivings and doubts, not
so much about this measure, but about the
principle to which thereby we give our
sanction, and to where it may lead in future.
This Mercantile Bank will have very little
effect on the banking business of this country.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: That is not what the
bankers say.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Any person who argues
that this legislation is desirable as a check
on monopoly is, of course, entirely wide of
the mark. The one thing that this bank
will not do is, check monopoly. Why? According to the information given in committee,
it proposes to operate in Vancouver and
Montreal.
Hon. Mr. Howard: That is just at the
beginning.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes, but very uncertain
information was given us as to what its possible extension would be.
Hon. Mr. Euler: They do not know as yet.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: To me it seems to be
clear what this bank is doing. It is establishing itself in Vancouver and Montreal to
handle international exchange associated with
Canadian trade. Now, will that break any
monopoly that may exist in Canada? I, of
course, do not admit that we have a monopoly;
but assuming that we have, will the establishment of this bank in Vancouver and Montreal
do anything to destroy that monopoly? What
competition will this new bank bring to the
general banking system of this country? None
whatever.
It will get what international
exchange it can in Vancouver and Montreal,
and will probably do very well financially.
It may be argued that in this restricted field
of international exchange it will provide a
measure of competition. However, I cannot

FEBRUABY 5, 1953
see where it is going to make any contribution at all so far as general competition in
Canada is concerned. If this bank were to
open offices throughout the country, seek
depositors, and give the service which the
established chartered banks give to the Canadian people, I would hold up both hands for
it without any qualification; but it does not
propose to do this. I think the sponsor of
the bill will agree that we have had no evidence placed before us that the bank will
do this.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: We have no evidence
that t will not do it.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: No, but when we are
undertaking something like this I think we
should require positive evidence.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Well, let the bank
start.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I repeat that if this were
a new bank which proposed to establish
offices across Canada to do business in the
ordinary way in exchange and loaning generally, as our existing Canadian banks do, I
would hold up both hands for it. Here is
where my misgivings enter the picture. If
ove grant this charter I think it is a ceriainty that we can look forward to receiving,
within the next few years, applications from
other banks to be granted precisely the same
privilege. Would that be a good and healthy
development? This brings me to what I
think is one of the strong features of our
Canadian banking business. Our system is
strong because its capital is strong. Public
interest is pretty effectively protected by
the provisions of the Bank Act, and by the
provisions for inspection by government
inspectors.
Canadian banks have pioneered in opening
branches in various communities throughout
the country. Thousands of branches are to
be found scattered all over Canada. Is that
a good thing? Is it desirable to have a system
of banking based on what is called the branch
bank principle?•I certainly think it is. We
were told in committee that banks which
established branches in newly-found communities frequently lost money. There is no
doubt that these banks helped to build up
our communities, and I submit that this is
a most useful service in any banking system.
One of the criticisms I have to offer on this
legislation is that the proposed Mercantile
Bank of Canada has not offered to give that
kind of service. It merely wishes to establish
itself in Vancouver and Montreal for the purpose of getting into international exchange
business associated with Canadian trade. It
will give a service that today is being given
by the existing Canadian banks.

If this were to be the end of the matter
we would not need to worry; but I warn the
house that we shall probably receive many
more similar applications. Parliament should
give careful consideration to the implications
that may lie in granting charters to, say a
dozen or a score of banks which propose to
operate in only a limited field in this country.
If this should happen Lt will undoubtedly
cause a severe strain on our existing branch
bank system. We shall not find, as we have
in the past, a disposition on the part of
banks to open branches in new communities
where they are likely to lose money; on the
contrary, we may even find a stronger disposition to close unprofitable branches than
there has been in the years gone by.
Honourable senators, these very briefly are
a few views which I wished to place before
this honourable house in connection with this
bill.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable members, I
gave some expression to my views in the
Banking and Commerce Committee yesterday
and I apologize to senators who were present
if I now repeat those views in some measure.
Let me say at the outset, though I think it is
not necessary to do so, that like the senator
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner), who
moved the six-months' hoist, and the leader
of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), I have not
been approached by anybody to support or
contest this bill. I intend to deal with this
legislation in exactly the same way as I think
I can truthfully say I deal with all legislation
that comes before this body-entirely on its
merits.
A good many things have been said this
afternoon which have no bearing on the bill
at all. We have been told that Canada has
the best banking system in the world. I do
not know whether that statement is true; it
certainly covers a great deal of territory.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The bankers admit it.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The bankers themselves
admit it, but that is not conclusive proof to
me. Without criticizing the banks in any
way, I rather suspect that they may still be
capable of improvement. My good friend the
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
said he had misgivings to the effect that if a
charter were granted to this bank it would
lead to, as I think a witness put it in committee yesterday, a spate of applications from
other countries.
Hon. Mr. Howard: A rash.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Mr. Towers called it that.
Hon. Mr. Euler: He called it a spate, but
it does not matter which word we use. My

SENATE
friend has said that he was afraid there
would be a great number of applications from
persons outside Canada, especially from the
United States. I do not regard that as an
unmixed evil. And I may now say that I
disagree with the leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) when he says that if parliament granted
this application it could not refuse the application of some other banks. I do not believe
for one minute that parliament has no backbone whatever, and has to yield to every
precedent that has been established. I disagree entirely with him.
I come back to the misgivings of my friend
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar). He felt
that if this application were granted we
would have a large number of applications
from other banks. He will find, if he goes
back twenty years, that we have had no such
experiences in the past, and we have had
banks from outside Canada operating here.
An application was granted to Barclay's Bank
to operate in Canada, and since that timeI believe it is twenty years ago-there has
not been a single application for a new
charter in Canada. I am not worried that
we shall ever be overwhelmed by applica
tions; and even if we were, I have enough
confidence in the independence of parliament
to choose which applications should be
granted in the interests of the country, and
which should not.
Hon. Mr. Horner: May I ask a question?
Hon. Mr. Euler: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Do you not think the
application from the foreign bank now under
consideration is in a different class from the
application by Barclay's Bank?
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I answer that question
by recounting something which has just
ocurred to me? In the old days we had what
was known as the British preferential tariff,
under which goods from Britain received
considerable concession by way of customs
duties. Textiles were among the commodities
coming in from Britain, and some attempt
was made to stop them. I pointed out to a
manufacturer of shirts and collars in my
town-whose raw material was textiles-that
it did not make much difference whether it
was a Britisher or someone from the United
States who put him out of business: the
result would be the same. But, strangely
enough, he was quite opposed to putting any
restrictions upon the importation of textiles
from Britain, because they were his raw
material and he wanted to get it as cheaply
as possible, but he was dead against lowering
the duty on shirts and collars. It all depends
on whose ox is gored.

One of the chief criticisms mentioned by
the bankers themselves was that the new
bank proposed to establish itself only in
Montreal, Vancouver and possibly Winnipeg
-I certainly think it should not overlook that
great city-and would not establish any
branches to serve the people in outlying districts. I asked why the banks established
branches in outlying places where they said
they were losing money, and they admitted
that they established branches because they
hoped that in time they would show profits.
Of course, that is an honest answer.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Eventually they would
show profits.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That is true; and I doubt if
it would be very long before they would do
so, even if in the bookkeeping system of the
bank no profit appeared. The money of
depositors is accepted in these small places at
the usual interest rate of one and a half per
cent, and goes to the head office to be loaned
out at four, five or six per cent.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Is that any different from
what is done in any other business?
Hon. Mr. Euler: Be that as it may, the
fact that this one additional bank with capital
of $l million does not propose to establish
branches in outlying places, makes no difference at all. I firmly believe that the coming
into Canada of this new bank can have no
ill effect whatsoever upon the chartered banks
operating now.
It has been said that in Canada banking
is a monopoly. That is true, but I do not
think it is at the moment a prejudicial
monopoly.
I think it was the honourable leader
opposite who, when speaking on the amendment, used the words "Tory" and "Liberal".
Hon. Mr. Haig: I never mentioned
politics.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Then I withdraw that
statement. It was the sponsor of the amendment. But in my discussion of the matter
I am speaking from the point of view of a
I am
liberal-spelled with a small "1".
rather surprised that a good Liberal like my
friend from Churchill should take the stand
he took with respect to private industry,
freedom of enterprise and so on. I do not
like the principle by which he would prevent
a foreign bank from ever coming into Canada.
It must be remembered that our own banks
set up branches in foreign countries, many
of them in the United States and elsewhere.
Hon. Mr. Horner: But they are restricted in
their operations.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Not under any federal
law of the United States that I know of. They

FEBRUARY 5, 1953
are restricted by reason of the fact that
the small banks over there come under the
jurisdiction of the state, in much the same
way as this unfortunate business of margarine
has been brought under our provincial jurisdiction.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I thought you would bring
that in.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I can always bring it in
when I am dealing with my friend from
Blaine Lake (Mr. Horner).
. But there is such a thing as the pot calling
the kettle black. The fact is that our banks
are carrying on business in other countries.
My friend mentioned that banking was not
a mercantile business. I would point out that
while our Canadian banks are not supposed
to carry on any other business but that of
banking, occasionally stock of other companies comes into their hands as collateral
for a loan that has not been repaid. I
learned with astonishment of a bank, located
not far from where I live, which, having
loaned a large amount to a manufacturing
concern that had got into financial difficulties,
and having obtained its stock as collateral,
took over, some ten or twelve years ago, the
operation of the business, and still retains
absolute control of it. I know, too, that,
when invited to sell it, their answer was, "No,
we regard it as a very good investment."
There rnay be other cases of the kind.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Did you call the attention
of the bank inspectors to this?
Hon. Mr. Euler: I made inquiry as to
whether the bank's action was legal, and I
found that it is.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Is the debt still owing?
Hon. Mr. Euler: No. I thought there was
a provision in the Bank Act that banks
which come into possession of real estate,
real property, anything of that kind, as a
result of default in payment of a debt to
them, must divest themselves within a limited
period of the property so acquired. But that
is not so.
Hon. Mr. AselIine: That applies to trust
companies.
Hon. Mr. Haig: And insurance companies.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I do not see any great
difference in principle between capital
brought into Canada for the promotion of a
bank, and capital coming in for other purposes. We know how we have welcomed
investment capital from other countries, particularly from the United States. If We
decide there should be so many banks in titis
country and no more, what is to be our atti-

tude if a new concern from abroad wants to
make automobiles in Canada? Are we to
say, "No; there are already enough factories
making automobiles in this country; we will
not allow you to start"? Sums of money
aggregating billions of dollars have come into
Canada to develop our resources and expand
our manufacturing facilities. Mainly this
capital is from the United States, though in
the old days a good deal of it was obtained
from Britain and elsewhere. Does my friend
take the position that we should not allow a
United States bank to establish here? Personally, I would have no objection if one
wished to come in. If we exclude foreign
capital and enterprise, shall we not be prevented from exporting our goods to those
countries whose money and whose industries
we refuse to admit? The whole trend of
world conditions today is towards as much
freedom of intercourse between nations as it
is possible to have. I happen to know a
little about insurance, for instance-unfortunately, perhaps for the companies with
which I am associated!-and I know that so
far as fire insurance is concerned more business is done in this country by foreign companies than by Canadian companies.
Or
think of life insurance; look at the big Metropolitan block on Wellington street in Ottawa.
Will it be argued that the owners of this fine
building are taking away business from
Canadian companies and that therefore we
should throw them out, as well as all other
foreign concerns?
- Personally I would do nothing to interfere
in any way with freedom of trade. Marine
insurance is handled almost entirely by
British companies, and I have learned that
they are not required even to pay taxes in
this country.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: I am not in favour of
that.
Hon. Mr. Euler: One argument which was
advanced both in committee yesterday -and
here today by the leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) is that no harm would be
done if this bill were delayed until next
year, when the Bank Act will be revised.
If that course were adopted the bill probably
could not be reintroduced before another two
years. I do not see any point to the suggestion. If, as the government leader intimated
a moment ago, no radical changes in the act
will be made, the bill might as well be put
through at once, unless there is some good
reason for rejecting it. If, on the other hand,
radical changes should be made in the act,
the promoters of this bill may decide that
under the circumstances they will not start
business; or if they do decide to operate,

SENATE
they will have to do so under the provisions
of the act as amended.
In conclusion, whatever difficulties may
arise from the establishment of this or any
other bank-and this particular bank, I know,
cannot do any harm-there is always the
Parliament of Canada which can be appealed
to, and which will do what it believes to be
in the best interests of this country.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, the subject is pretty well talked out.
Someone has already said-and I agree with
him-that many of the comments made were
wide of the mark, not having very much
to do with the subject which is before us.
But there is one phase of this dispute and
of this debate which interests me; that is,
the clash of minds between those who think
on one side of the line of demarcation and
those who think on the other side. The
honourable gentleman from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner) referred-shall I say, with
disapproval, because if I said "with contempt" he might object to it-to what he
called the "liberal" mind. As I listened to
the debate it seemed to me that there was
something in what he said; that there is a
fundamental distinction, which crops up all
the way along the line, between what he
calls the liberal mind and what, for lack
of a better term, we might call the conservative mind. It is sometimes referred to as the
Tory mind, but that also has a suggestion
of contempt which I do not like. In the
present instance we will speak of the liberal
mind as opposed to the conservative mind:
it sounds better, and I have no desire in
these remarks to give offence.
Here, I say, is a demonstration of these
two minds. Take the remark made by the
honourable member from Bruce (Hon. Mr.
Stambaugh) as to the right of all the people
to the benefits of competition between those
engaged in the financial trade. Or mark
the intense liberalism of my honourable
friend from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler).
Nobody can fail to understand his position
in questions of this kind, because we know
that his is a genuinely liberal mind.
I was a little astonished at the remarks of
my honourable friend from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar), but I think he was talking in
detail rather than in broad principles. He
is impressed with the advantages of our
centralized system of banking: bank branches
all over Canada gathering up the money in
the small communities and sending it to
the central offices to be there distributed
not infrequently to the benefit of the larger
corporations. I am not so sure in its actual
working-out that that is an unmixed advantage as compared to the old system of small,
local private banks receiving the deposits of

the community: where loans were made
by the managers who were often the proprietors and who risked their own money,
but who knew the locality, the people in it
and their resources.
I am sometimes doubtful as to whether
our present banking system is quite as good
as those who enjoy its benefits seern to think.
As I said earlier in the debate, these men
are ready to admit that it is the best system
in the world. From their standpoint it
probably is, but whether it is so from the
standpoint of all Canada is a matter for real
consideration.
I was talking about the clash between the
two fundamental methods of thought, the
liberal mind as opposed to the conservative
mind. I think that is the way the honourable
gentleman from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr.
Horner) put it. I would not object at all
if everyone in Canada could look in on this
chamber today and observe the leader of the
opposition and his followers standing foursquare on the side of private interests, the
bankers of Canada, while the liberals in
almost complete unanimity are standing for
the interests of the people of Canada as a
whole, in order that they may enjoy the
benefits of competition in finance. I should
like everybody on the sidelines and on the
streets, in the great municipalities and in the
rural districts of Canada to observe what
would happen if my friend who leads the
Conservative party in this house had his way
in the coming election.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: I rise on a point of
order. I do not think the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)
is speaking to the subject at all.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I do not see how his
remarks have anything to do with the question of whether or not we incorporate this
bank.
The Hon. the Speaker: I would ask the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity to stick
more closely to the subject under debate.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Mr. Speaker, with all
respect, I do not admit that I am not sticking to the subject. I think that I am. I am
answering a suggestion by my friend the
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) that
after the election another government may
be taking over, and that in the meantime we
should hold up this bill.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I said there may or may
not be a new government.
The Hon. the Speaker: I gathered in his
reference to the next administration the honourable leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.

FEBRUARY 5, 1953
Haig) did not suggest it would propose any
radical change in the banking law.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is correct, Mr. Speaker.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The very purpose of
the bill to revise the Bank Act will be to
amend the banking law, whether the present
government or another government is in
office at the time. I think I am well within
my rights when I say that I trust the government which is in office when that law is
amended, will not be controlled by members
of the opposition who seem to defend private
interests just because they are successful.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Do you call the present
banking system a private business?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Banks are private institutions and therefore are private interests.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask the honourable
senator a question? If he does not believe
in the present system, what system does he
believe in?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I did not say that I do
not believe in the present system. I said I
am doubtful whether centralized banking is
as fine a thing as those who engage in it
would lead us to believe. My making of
the remark does not mean I am proposing a change in our banking system. Canadian manufacturers have done a magnificent
job and have been highly successful, but are
we to say that there should be no more
manufacturers lest competition should interfere with the success of those manufacturers
who are already established? Our professions, too, have done a magnificent job and
have been very successful. Are we to protect them by not allowing newcomers to
compete with them? And our farmers have
been successful. Shall we stop the growth
of the farming industry in order to protect
the interests of those already engaged in
farming? Where do we draw the line? Is
finance sacrosanct in this country? If so,
are we to stop incorporating trust companies
that deal in finance because the existing trust
companies are successful and are doing a
good job? The difference between liberal
and conservative minds is that Conservatives
would protect those interests in their privilege, while the Liberals would protect them
so far as their rights are concerned, but
with due and fair consideration for the rights
of the general public to the competition to
which it is entitled.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Who set up the central
bank which deprived the banks of large sums
of money?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I do not see the cogency
of the question.

Hon. Mr. Horner: This is the cogency. You
have made reference to the Conservatives,
and I am saying that since Confederation
the Conservatives have been the only ones to
do anything to reduce the earnings of banks.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Is my friend opposed
to the central bank in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Horner: No, I am not. I am saying that if it were not for a Conservative
government there would not be a central
bank in Canada today.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: If that is so, then that
is one thing that has been accomplished by
a Conservative government.
Honourable senators, I am opposing the
motion before the house because I am on the
side of the general public, in the liberal
meaning of that term. I intend to vote for
the incorporation of this bank, and I shall
probably favour further similar incorporations
if applications come before us. If it can be
shown that national interests are involved,
then we can consider each application on its
own merits.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: For my part I give no
notice now that I will not consider future
applications, even if they come from the
United States of America. Let them all come,
and the general public will benefit as a consequence. I am voting against the amendment before the house.
Some Hon. Senators: Question.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, in amendment it is moved by the
Honourable Senator Horner, seconded by the
Honourable Senator Quinn, that the word
"now" be left out and the words "this day
six months" be added at the end of the
motion. Those honourable senators in favour
of the amendment will please say "yea".
Some Hon. Senators: Yea.
The Hon. the Speaker: Those honourable
senators opposed to the amendment will
please say "nay".
Some Hon. Senators: Nay.
The Hon. the Speaker: I declare the amendment lost.
Honourable senators, the question now is
on the motion by the Honourable Senator
Hugessen, seconded by the Honourable Senator Fafard, that Bill A-1, intituled "an Act
to incorporate the Mercantile Bank of
Canada", be now read the third time. Is it
your pleasure to carry the motion?
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed, on division.

SENATE
JUDGES BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the third reading of Bill 104, an Act to amend the Judges
Act, 1946.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
INDIAN BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING

Hon. G. H. Ross moved the second reading of Bill Z, an Act to amend the Indian
Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the object of
this bill is to remedy what appears to me to
be ari anomaly in the law relating to Indians
in Canada.
The position, as I understand it, is this:
under the existing law anyone may sue an
Indian in the courts and, if successful, enter
a judgment against him, but the law forbids
recovery under any process issued out of
court on the strength of that judgment.
The matter was brought to my attention
in this way. One day last summer a lawyer
came to see me and said lie had a client who
appeared to have a claim against an Indian
arising out of an automobile accident. He
could sue the Indian, but if lie did and
recovered judgment, section 88 of the Indian
Act prevented recovery. It reads in part as
follows:
. . . the real and personal property of an Indian
or a band situated on a reserve is not subject to
. . . attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution
in faveur or at the instance of any person other
than an Indian.

Some of the Indians are well to do; a
number of them own a hundred head of
cattle or more and other valuable property.
Yet, if a non-Indian obtains judgment against
one of these well-to-do Indians lie has no
right to recover through court process, as
the property of the Indian is not exigible.
The Indian may laugh at his creditor. Claims
are arising and wrongs are being committed
from day to day for which there is no remedy.
With one hand a creditor is given the right
to sue an Indian; with the other his right to
recover is taken away.
In my opinion this is not as it should be.
When a court has once given a judgment
against an Indian, whether the cause of action
arises out of an automobile accident or otherwise, the sheriff armed with a writ of execution or other proper process, should have the
right to seize the property of the Indian to
the same extent, but to no greater extent, than
lie could seize the property of anyone else.
In my province a debtor is entitled to many
exemptions, including a modest home and

furniture, clothing for himself and family,
equipment to carry on farming operations,
seed grain, food and other property. I believe
all the other provinces in Canada grant
similar protection to their citizens. Should
this bill become law, the Indian will be
entitled to the same protection as other
debtors-no more and no less.
An Indian may drive his automobile carelessly and run down non-Indians, causing
loss of life, great suffering and the destruction of valuable property for which he may
be prosecuted in the criminal courts but he
cannot be required to pay for the damage
he does. Apart from the fear of prosecution
under the criminal law, there is no incentive
for him to exercise care towards others. He
is not answerable to non-Indians for losses
they sustain through his recklessness or
wrongdoing, even that which occurs while
lie is driving under the influence of liquor.
Why should lie go to the expense of carrying
public liability insurance on his car, when
lie is not liable to others for the losses they
suffer through his careless driving?
Should this bill become law, he will know
that lie is liable for his recklessness, and on
contracts too, to the same extent as any other
citizen; and lie will soon learn that if lie
negligently causes loss to others he must
make good those losses in the same way and
to the same extent as any other citizen would
have to do.
The object of the existing law is to protect
the Indian against trickery on the part of
non-Indians. Protection may have been necessary in the early settlement of the country,
but the Indians are making progress towards
looking after themselves. They should be
given greater freedom and greater responsibility. The wily white man may take an
unfair advantage in some cases, but that
would not often happen. By trial and error
the Indian will learn to look after himself.
Experience is a wonderful teacher. I believe
that such added freedom and responsibility
would be better for the Indians and would
tend to make them better citizens. In this
respect let us treat them, not as children, but
as adults.
I hope the house will give this bill second
reading. Should it do so, I shall move that
the bill be referred to a standing committee
which may scrutinize it and hear the Minister or someone from the Indian Affairs
Branch in order to ascertain the need, if any,
for the continuance of the present law.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Robertson, the
debate was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday,
February 10, at 8 p.m.

ROYAL STYLE AND TITLES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishari McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 102, an Act respecting
the Royal Style and Titles.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to express the assent of the
Parliament of Canada to an exercise of the
royal prerogative to establish the Royal style
and titles for Canada as part of a general
establishment of the royal titles in countries
of the commonwealth.

The future designation of the Sovereign
was the subject of discussion and general
agreement at the meeting of Commonwealth
Prime Ministers which took place in London
in December of 1952. The principle established at that time was that uniformity should
be attained in so far as the constitutional
position of the various commonwealth countries would permit. Happily this goal was
achieved and, as applied to this country, the
title of Her Majesty will be "Elizabeth the
Second by the Grace of God, of the United
Kingdom, Canada, and her other realms and
territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth,
Defender of the Faith". This is the style
which will be used also by Australia and
New Zealand, the only change in each
instance being the substitution of the
name of the country concerned. It will also
be used, with certain adjustments, in Pakistan
and the Union of South Africa.
This new title, as will be readily ascertained, embodies recognition of every minority,
race and creed within the far-flung brotherhood which constitutes the British Commonwealth. Herein our gracious sovereign
Elizabeth is described as the Queen of Canada;
the title "Head of the Commonwealth" meets
the special wishes of India which, although
having become a republic, desires to adhere to
our family of nations; the title "Defender
of the Faith" implies recognition of belief in
the Supreme Authority which guides our
destinies, and unrestricted freedom of all
peoples to worship and pursue the faiths of
their fathers.
Honourable members of the Senate will
appreciate fully the tremendous changes that
have taken place in the style and title of the
sovereign since Egbert proclaimed himself
King of the English in the ninth century. At
that time the prerogative of the royal title
rested entirely with the royal person, and
that designation was maintained, strengthened and extended by succeeding British
monarchs in a manner commensurate with
the growth of their power and extension of
sovereignty -over foreign lands through the
middle centuries. In earlier days the title
listed by name the countries over which the
sovereign held sway, and for a long period
included the designation "King of France".
Meantime, however, the first seeds of the
democratic process had begun to germinate
until, cultivated unwittingly by ill-advised
and despotic sovereigns, they blossomed forth
in revolutionary form during the Stuart
regime and parliament was established as
the principal instrument of government in
the land. The exercise of the royal prerogative in respect of the sovereign's title was
no longer made without the concurrence of
parliament.

SENATE
The growth of parliament and its power to
execute the will of the people could not be
confined to the United Kingdom. In her
colonies and dominions the spirit of responsible government developed until, in 1930, the
various members of the British commonwealth decided that the assent of the parliaments of all the dominions as well as the
parliament of the United Kingdom was
required in order to change the royal style and
titles. Even within recent years the constitutional changes in our sister commonwealth
countries of Ireland and India have necessitated amendments to the title of the sovereign.
The new designation of the sovereign as
the Queen of Canada will serve to remind
students of Canadian history that the concept is not a new one. In the London Conference of 1866-67 Sir John A. Macdonald
endeavoured to have the new union of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, designated as the Kingdom of Canada. This idea
was opposed at the time by the home government, lest it antagonize certain elements in
the newly formed republic to the south; and
although early drafts of the British North
America Act contained references to the
"Kingdom of Canada" in the handwriting of
that great statesman, he finally gave way
to the pressure of the British government of
the day and accepted "Dominion of Canada"
as a compromise.
The function of the sovereign may have
changed with the passing years, but it has
achieved an importance no less than it had
during the 'days of absolute monarchy. At
that time it was confined to a comparatively
small portion of the world's lands and peoples.
Today it binds together peoples of varying
races, creeds and colours, in all parts of the
world, in a common brotherhood, working
together in the best interests of each member
of this great family and for the welfare of
all mankind.
Some significance of the present position
of the crown can be appreciated by the fact
that members of the commonwealth have
preserved this common bond in one Queen
as its head, notwithstanding that she has no
constitutional function to perform in respect
of one commonwealth member, the great
republic of India.
By the -constitutional
precepts of the last century such an anomaly
would have been thought impossible. It is
a credit and a great tribute to the realism,
vision and wisdom of the leaders of those
countries today-and to what might well be
described as the inspiration and sanctity of
the crown in the modern world-that, instead
of being slaves to a form of government, free
peoples may adapt their constitutions to

meet the needs of our changing times, and
serve to the maximum the welfare of its
people.
As one contemplates the developing circumstances surrounding the changing relations
between the crown and the commonwealth,
two basic and fundamental iprinciples are
again emphasized. During a period in which
some thrones have tottered and, fallen, and
autocratic rulers have seen their grandiose
schemes of conquest collapse through a rain
of exploding bombs or by the assassin's
knife, each passing year has served but to
increase the love and respect of the peoples
of the United Kingdom, Cana-da and Her
Majesty's other realms and territories for
the institution which binds them together.
This love and respect is free and spontaneous.
It has its origin in the single fact that to an
ever-increasing degree those who occupy the
highest office have embodied in themselves
the simple virtues that are the very foundation of our civilization. As we all face a
troubled future, we can gain confidence by
recalling the past.
What a lesson for anyone is the spectacle of
the great republic of India, freely electing to
continue her relationship with the commonwealth by recognizing the Queen as its head.
It seems only yesterday that the reports of
the bitterness and ill-feeling that characterized her struggle for complete independence
were daily headlines-ill-feeling that one
might have thought it would take generations to erase-and yet, once the natural
instinct of peoples to rule themselves had
been satisfied, almost overnight the people
of India freely and of their own volition
sought to continue their association with an
institution which stands for freedom, the
dignity of the individual, and peace and good
will among men. Truly this institution has
been builded upon a rock.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
may I first congratulate the honourable
leader of the government upon his fine
address to this chamber. He bas expressed
completely, I am sure, the sentiments of all
of us, and I would not attempt to cover again
the ground that he has covered.
I do, however, want to say how happy we
are about the outcome of the Prime Ministers'
conference held in London last fall. Canada
can indeed be proud of her representatives,
our Prime Minister and his associates, at
that conference. It was a fortunate day for
Canada that she had as her chief representative the present Prime Minister.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

FEBRUARY 10, 1953
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I emphasize a point
touched upon only lightly by the honourable
leader of the government? He mentioned the
troubled world in which we live today. We
saw the organization and work of the League
of Nations; we witnessed its replacement by
the present United Nations organization; but
throughout all the vicissitudes of life there
stands that greater organization, the British
Commonwealth of Nations, which, without
regulation, without constitution and without
convenant, holds together a body of free
nations. The recent London conference to
which I referred is another of several
examples of the ability of these free nations
to meet together as free peoples. It is proof
that rules and regulations do not always
make a sound basis for organization.
One of the hopes of my life bas been that
I would see the day when the United States
of America would join the British Commonwealth of Nations; when that country would
do as India and Pakistan have done: without
any compulsion, join this body of freedomloving people under one monarchy.
The peculiar characteristic of the peoples
of the British Empire is their ability to work
out their own problems. While our monarch
may make mistakes-though not the kind of
mistakes which have been made recently by
another monarch-there seems to be a
peculiar ability among the pairtners of the
commonwealth to find a solution for their
difficulties with honour to all, while always
maintaining the goodness and freedom which
exist under their system.
As a Canadian I am delighted to have a
young woman such as Her Majesty Queen
Elizabeth II to succeed to the title of Queen
of not only Canada and the empire, but of
the British Commonwealth of Nations.
The people of Canada greatly enjoyed the
visit to this country a little more than a year
ago of Her Majesty the Queen-then Princess
Elizabeth-and her distinguished husband.
The royal couple left with all Canadians the
impression that this was womanhood and
manhood at its highest level. We as Canadians can indeed be proud to belong to an
empire whose Q-ueen and her consort represent so well the simple virtues of a happy
home lif e. Peoples of the empire and of the
world at large are greatly impressed by the
quality of our monarch.
I am whole-heartedly in favour of this bill.
We on this side of the house join most
heartily in honouring Queen Elizabeth the
Second. May the wish of the world come
true, that we have another Elizabethan age
in our lifetime.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Donald MacLennan: Honourable
senators, I read with great interest and
pleasure the speeches made in another place,
and I have listened with very much pleasure
to the speeches made here tonight. While
our leader was speaking I was struck with
the truthfulness of the adage, "We live and
learn". Reading the speech of the Prime
Minister, and listening to our leader here, I
discovered that there is a new meaning to
a part of the royal style and titles of our
gracious Queen. I was always under the
impression that the title "Defender of the
Faith" was ýgiven by the Pope to Henry VIII,
but the Prime Minister and my leader, like
pretty good lawyers-I know our friend here
is not a lawyer, but he is keen enough to
be one-have read into this title that it means
a belief in the Supreme Being. Until I heard
what my leader said I was apprehensive that
the honourable, broad-minded and tolerant
member from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner),
considering the source from which this title
came, would move to have it deleted. But,
like Macmorris in King Henry the Fifth,
I suppose "it is no time to discourse" on the
Pope, nor whether Franco of Spain should
be recognized by the United Nations, nor
about separate schools.
While the various speakers made some
allusions to history, they steered clear of one
bit of history which, I know, will be of
much interest to many people in this country.
In order to make my meaning clear I will
read, with your permission, an extract from
The Dalhousie Review, an excellent periodical
printed in Halifax, Nova Scotia. This article
was written by a professor of history in Los
Angeles whose ancestors nine generations
ago came from across the water. I am sorry
that my friend the honourable senator from
Southern New Brunswick (Hon. Mr. McLean)
is not in the chamber, for I believe he would
agree with me on the propriety of reading
this extract. The writer states:
Most of the comments on the Stone of Scone
have missed the important historical aspects of the
matter, and have completely failed to consider the
legend of the Stone of Scone in any way. If the
Stone of Scone has any meaning whatever, then it
is in connection with its ancient legend of being
the Stone of Destiny. The common statement that
it is a symbol of Scottish sovereignty is quite
inadequate; it is a symbol of Scottish sovereignty
over any country that holds it. Thus, if you steal
the Stone, you have a Lion Rampant by the tail,
for the Scots will ultimately come to rule your
country.
The legend of the Stone of Scone is that "The
Scots shall govern, and the sceptre sway. Wher'er
this Stone they find, and its dread sound obey." So
wrote Hector Boece, a 16th century Dundee
historian.
Wyntoun's 14th century Original Chronicle of
Scotland gives it as "So long as Fate rules not in
vain, where this Stone rests, there Scots shall
reign."

SENATE
The Stone was stolen by Edward I about the
year 1296, and the Treaty of Northampton of
fictions

or

pre

that

the

sovereignty

of

fitin o
peences thttesveegt
of
Scotland is compromised by the Stone being outside its borders is completely demolished, not only
by the legend itself, but by this Treaty in which
England acknowledged that she had been defeated
in her attempts to overcome Scotland. But the
Scots had the last laugh, for in 1603 the short-lived
English monarchy died out, and the much older
Scottish monarchy took over. James VI of Scotland ruled both countries and, by laws agreed to
by English and Scotch alike, only his descendants
can ever hold the British throne. The prophecy
came true. The institution, continuity, and succession of the British monarchy are purely Scottish. It is based on the heritable principles of
Scottish Law, which recognize the validity of its
numerous distaffian descents.
English Law does
not recognize the validity of distaffian descents,
but English Law has no application to the matter.
Elizabeth of Windsor is, through George VI, a
direct descendant of James VI-to use his senior
Scottish title-and is in no sense an "English"
Queen. This descendant of Mary, Queen of Scots,
Robert Bruce, Malcolm Canmore, and Kenneth
MacAlpin, the founder of the Scottish State in
843 A.D., is historically "Elizabeth I of Scotland,"
and legally "Elizabeth I of Great Britain," but is
sometimes colloquially called by the defunct 'title'
of "Elizabeth II of England."
She holds the throne under article II of the
Treaty of Union of 1707. The title "King (or
Queen) of England" was abolished, and the monarchs are now Kings or Queens of the "United
Kingdom of Great Britain," under article I of the
Treaty of Union of 1707. The daughter of George
VI and his Highland Queen, Lady Elizabeth
Bowes-Lyon, will be described on future British
coins as of "Britannia Omnia Regina," or "Queen
of All Britain," just as George VI was described
as of "Britannia Omnia Rex," or King of All
Britain."
Elizabeth of Windsor will be crowned
over the Stone of Scone in another full realization
of its ancient prophecy, while her son, Bonnie
Prince Charles, inherits one of Robert Bruce's early
titles, "Earl of Carrick," and certain other Scottish
titles, under a Scottish law of 1469. He inherits
no English titles.
True to its Scottish ancestry, the royal family
claims its Scottish tartans as of hereditary right,
and not by courtesy. George V described the Royal
Stewart tartan as "my personal tartan."

Honourable senators, I hope that this country in particular and, for that matter, all
all countries, will recognize what Scotland has
done not only for the Empire but for the
whole worid.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: Here is to that day
and all who honour it! Scotland for ever!
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators, in
accordance with the provisions of the British
North America Act, on July 1, 1867, Ontario,
Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick
became one dominion under the British
crown. Our federation now includes ten
provinces, and Canada enjoys the status of
an international power. The growth of our
country has been almost miraculous. Our

constitutional evolution within the commonwealth has been such that it has been deemed
necessary to change the form of the royal
style and titles. In the bill before us we are
asked to express our assent to an exercise
of the royal prerogative and to give our
approval to the issue of a proclamation under
the Great Seal of Canada. This royal proclamation will establish for Canada the following royal style and titles:
Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of
the United Kingdom, Canada and her other realms
and territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth,
Defender of the Faith.

In other words, our gracious sovereign will
be formally proclaimed Queen of Canada, and
the federal union of our ten provinces will
be described officially as a realm. The term
"dominion" will therefore cease to be used in
the royal titles for Canada. The term
"dominion" was accepted at the London Conference of 1866-67 by Sir John A. Macdonald
only after he had tried without success to
obtain for our four original provinces the
title of "kingdom". When King Edward VII
ascended to the throne in 1901 the style
adopted was "King of the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Ireland and of the
British Dominions beyond the seas". At that
time Sir Wilfrid Laurier expressed his
preference for adding, after the title of King
of Great Britain and Ireland and Emperor of
India, the words "King of Canada, Australia,
South Africa and all the British Dominions
beyond the seas". Finally however, the
names of the greater dominions were omitted.
As remarked by Mr. Pearson-I am referring
to the Commons Hansardof February 3, 1953,
at page 175-in the expression "British
Dominions beyond the seas", since 1901, "the
independent countries of Australia, Canada,
New Zealand and South Africa were lumped
together with the colonies and other dependencies of the British Crown." Personally I
would add that the word "dominion" was thus
used as still being applicable to al colonies,
whether they were self-governing or not.
There is no reason to continue perpetuating
that ambiguity. It is therefore a matter of
rejoicing for the great majority of our people
that at the Commonwealth Conference of last
December the representatives of Australia and
New Zealand agreed with our own delegates
to use the royal style and titles similar to
the text now before us, except of course that
in each of those instances the name of the
particular realm concerned would be substituted for "Canada."
The change which has been proposed to
us will mark another important step in our
constitutional development. Our Prime Minister deserves our heartiest congratulations

FEBRUARY 10, 1953
upon his very eloquent presentation of this
bill in the other house. He has achieved the
task begun by Macdonald and continued by
Laurier. I would add that the very happy
remarks of Mr. St. Laurent show at one
and the same time our faith in Canada's constant progress and our fidelity to Canada's
great historical traditions. If we accept the
royal style and titles proposed for our
approval, we shall affirm first of all our conviction that our gracious Queen is our lawful
sovereign "by the grace of God". In these
words we declare to the whole world that
we consider any legitimate authority to be
of divine origin. We retain also the expression "Defender of the Faith" and these words
are, in my opinion, equivalent to "Defender
of the fundamental creed of all those who
believe in the Fatherhood of God". We therefore consider Her Majesty as being dedicated
to the protection of the sacred principle of
freedom of conscience throughout our
immense commonwealth.
After these references of a religious nature,
let us turn to our relations with the British
crown. In 1867 we united to form one
nation under the crown of the United Kingdom. In this year of 1953 we are proud to
proclaim that the Queen of Great Britain
is still the symbol of our unity and the
"Head of the Commonwealth". Those last
words show the strength and the flexibility
of that world-wide alliance of freedom-loving people who live in what is known as the
commonwealth. We have become, gradually
and peacefully, a free and voluntary association, bound together by our democratic
ideal and our parliamentary institutions of
British origin. In many respects, we differ.
But whatever may be our faith, our race,
our ways of life, our language or the colour
of our skin, whether by our constitution we
form the realm of Canada or the republic of
India, we all have in our hearts the same
love for our free institutions; we share them
in common with the other members of the
great brotherhood which we call the commonwealth. With all our associates from Great
Britain, from Australia and New Zealand,
from India, Pakistan and Ceylon, from Asia
and from Africa, from the West Indies and
all the rest of the commonwealth, deep, deep
in our soul, we nourish for Her Majesty the
Queen a feeling of respect and of affection.
She is the living symbol of our moral unity.
She embodies our ideal of freedom, justice
and progress. Her dignity, her charm, her
devotion to duty are for all of us a source
of inspiration. Above the divisions of our
parties, the crown is the surest guarantee of
our political stability.
Without our gracious sovereign the commonwealth would not be what it is. because

through Her Majesty we are united in Our
pursuit of an ever-increasing measure of
liberty and of happiness for every one. Without the British crown the world would not
be the same and the social progress of mankind would suffer a serious setback. As a
perfect example of home life, Her Majesty
the Queen is a radiant image of peace, order
and harmony. Through her, members of
the commonwealth have the feeling of being
united, so to speak, by some mysterious
family ties. In ber quality of "Head of the
Commonwealth" our gracious Queen is the
head of a real "family" of free nations-a
young and royal mother, dedicated to the
cause of peace and happiness of all her
subjects and of all mankind. May she long
reign over us!
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
I have listened with a great deal of interest
to the discussion of the subject-matter before
the house tonight. I want not only to commend the speakers who have taken part in the
debate, but to endorse all that they have said.
May I especially express my appreciation of
the splendid speech made by the leader of
the government.
Naturally, I was interested to hear a remark
made about the Stone of Scone. I am rising
at this time not to discuss its history, but
only to say that in my opinion the royal title
is not historically correct. The present
monarch is Queen Elizabeth I of Canada,
not Queen Elizabeth II of Canada. This
question was seriously raised in the land
where I was born. It was pointed out that
Scotland was closer to the crown than even
Canada is; and the historians of that country
were not contradicted when they pointed out
to the English authorities that Elizabeth was
Elizabeth I of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland. Therefore, she is Elizabeth I of
Canada.
To some this may seem a trivial point; but
to me, history should be exact and correct.
Therefore, I have no hesitation in saying that
the royal title, as it applies to this country,
is Elizabeth I.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall the bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: With leave of the
Senate, I move the third reading now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
Honourable senators rose and sang God
Save The Queen.

SENATE
PRIVATE BILL
'flN

l

oWAfnwr

Hon. W. M. Aseltine moved the second
reading of Bill T-3, an Act to incorporate
the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Western
Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, although this
measure is similar in all respects to other
bills of its kind, perhaps I should make some
explanation of it.
The bill names the persons who will be the
first directors of the corporation. It sets out
the purpose of the measure, provides powers
to make by-laws and regulations governing
its management, and gives authority for the
borrowing of money and the acquisition of
property.
This bill bas been approved by the Law
Clerk of the Senate and is, as I have said,
similar in every respect to other bills of its
nature. Perhaps honourable senators would
like some information on the reason for the
proposed incorporation of the synod.
The Evangelical Lutheran Synod has congregations throughout the four western provinces, and a few mission stations in the
Northwest Territories. Its jurisdiction is that
part of Canada west of the Great Lakes or,
more particularly, the area west of the eightysixth meridian of longitude, including the
Yukon and the Northwest Territories. The
synod in 1952 had 125 congregations in western
Canada, 55 pastors, 17,635 baptized members
and 11,841 confirmed members.
The Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Manitoba was formed on July 22, 1897. It was
known as "The German Evangelical Lutheran
Synod of Manitoba and the Northwest Territories." In 1907 the name was changed to
"The Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Manitoba and other Provinces", and in 1947 the
name was again changed to that set out in
the bill, namely "The Evangelical Lutheran
Synod of Western Canada". But when the
synod started to do business it found that it
could not take title or otherwise deal for
church purposes with real property. Up to a
short time ago its officials were of the opinion that the synod had been incorporated,
and it was only when it ran into difficulties
in connection with real estate transactions,
and inquiries were made, that it was ascertained that in fact there had never been
an incorporation.
In some cases where a local congregation
has ceased to function it is necessary that
the synod take title to the church or manse
property. It is also necessary for the synod
to acquire residential proiperty for the use
of its president and treasurer. Further, the
United Lutheran Church in America will

make loans to the synod for the use of local
congregations in Western Cânidn, on pnnAition that the church board in New York be
given mortgage security on the church property. Of course, while the synod is unincorporated, no security of that nature can
be given.
Although this synod is an independent
unit it is associated closely and works in harmony with the United Lutheran Church in
America, which has its head office in New
York, and consists of thirty-three individual
and separate synods located in the United
States, Canada and some places in Europe.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Merely as a matter of
information, may I inquire whether there is
not now an incorporated Lutheran Synod of
Canada?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I thought my honourable friend would raise that point. Besides
the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Western
Canada, there are in Canada the Evangelical
Lutheran Synod of Nova Scotia, which was
incorporated by chapter 276 of the Statutes
of Nova Scotia, 1903, and the Evangelical
Lutheran Synod of Canada, incorporated by
special Act of Parliament of Canada, chapter
32 of the statutes of 1885.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Are the headquarters
of the last-mentioned organization in Ontario?
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: It is a dominion body.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: My honourable friend
just mentioned that the headquarters of the
Nova Scotia unit are in Halifax.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: That body was incorporated by an act of the Legislature of Nova
Scotia.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Is the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Canada connected only with
Ontario?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: As I said, it was incorporated by chapter 32 of the Dominion
statutes of 1885. But I am informed that the
Nova Scotia Synod, the Evangelical Lutheran
Synod of Canada, and the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Western Canada are, like the
Presbyterians, the Methodists, the United
Church of Canada, and other bodies, individual and separate units.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: If my honourable friend
will permit me to say so, I think there is a
very definite difference between the Lutheran
churches to which he referred and the others
he has just mentioned', because, for instance.
the United Church of Canada is a single
national organization, as is the Presbyterian
Church in Canada. Evidently the Lutheran
Church of Western Canada is affiliated with a
similar denomination in the United States and

FEBRUARY 10, 1953
not with the denomination known as the
Lutheran Church of Canada, which, I judge,
relates mainly to the province of Ontario.
The Maritime unit, too, is separate. Whether
there is any advantage in this or any other
legislative body making distinctions of that
sort, I do not know.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
I move that the bill be referred to the Standing Comrnmittee on Miscellaneous Private Bills.
The motion was agreed to.
NATIONAL DEFENCE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishar McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 103, an Act to amend
the National Defence Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to amend the National Defence
Act so as to provide for the appointment of
an Associate Minister of National Defence,
and for his salary. It is true that the National
Defence Act authorizes the appointment of
such an associate minister in times of emergency. The government, however, does not
feel that a state of emergency such as was
contemplated by the Emergency Powers Act
or the National Defence Act, and was experienced from 1914 to 1918 and from 1939 to
1945, exists today. The Emergency Powers
Act states that an international emergency
exists which threatens the security of Canada,
and that certain emergency powers might be
required by the government.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Is the honourable gentleman
dealing with the Emergency Powers Act or
the National Defence Act?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The National Defence
Act. I am merely giving the reasons for
proceeding in this way. As I said, the
Emergency Powers Act states that an international emergency exists which threatens the
security of Canada, and that certain
emergency powers might be required by the
government. However, the National Defence
Act, in section 20, defines "emergency" as
war, invasion, riot or insurrection, real or
apprehended.
While the present conflict in Korea is warlare in every sense of the word, and the outcome might determine the course of future
and greater conflicts, it is something different
from the total warfare we experienced during
two earlier periods of this century. The
degree of emergency is one which governs
the course of action of the government in such

matters. It is for these reasons, therefore,
that the government has used the usual
methods of an ordinary statutory amendment
to the National Defence Act to provide for
the appointment of an associate minister and
for the payment of a salary to that minister.
At the present time a number of countries
including the United Kingdom, France and
Australia have an over-all Minister of
National Defence and a separate minister for
each of the three services. During World
War II we had in this country a Minister of
National Defence and associate Ministers
of National Defence for Air and Naval Services. Following the cessation of hostilities
it was decided that efforts should be made
toward unification and co-ordination of the
three services, and this was accordingly carried out so that the administration of all three
came under one Minister of Defence.
Advantages to be gained in unification of
the services under one minister are farreaching and numerous. It was felt by the
government that it would be better to have
one minister with adequate powers to recommend the allocation of funds voted by parliament, and of the manpower available to the
department, in the most effective way possible among the three services. Similarly,
it was felt desirable that one minister should
receive the representations of each of the
three services in respect of allocations of
manpower and moneys. Through this process
of unification under one minister it was hoped
to eliminate the inevitable overlapping and
duplication which characterized the multiministerial procedure.
As I have pointed out, this policy would
have proved effective for normal operations
in peacetime; but peace was denied us. We
are now engaged in a cold war in certain
areas of the world; in a hot war in others.
With the war in Korea, the development of
the defence program, the buildup of forces
in Europe, and our commitments under the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, greatly
increased responsibilities have fallen upon
the shoulders of the Minister of National
Defence in administering the affairs of the
department both within the country and
without.
Across Canada are operational units of the
army, navy and air force.
The administration of the department
abroad requires the minister to be absent
from the country frequently and for considerable periods of time. In Korea we have
the 25th Infantry Brigade and several
destroyers of the Royal Canadian Navy; in
Kure is located the Commonwealth divisional
hospital; in Tokyo are to be found recreation

SENATE
centres and the Japanese end of the air lift
from McChord field in the state of Washington. in England we have an R.C.A.F.
wing at North Luffenham, a joint staff mission and training centre. The 27th Brigade
is stationed in Germany, another wing of the
R.C.A.F., is located in France, and Canadian
representatives of NATO and SHAFE are
working in Paris.
Widely deployed as our forces are today,
detailed arrangements must be undertaken
with other governments respecting their
accommodation and the circumstances under
which they operate on foreign soil. Agreements must be made respecting jurisdictions
in civil and criminal matters, customs duties
and other taxes, passport and immigration
regulation, tenure of land, maintenance of
buildings and numerous other questions of
complexity and importance. In addition there
are legal and constitutional matters, details
of standardization of arins with our allies in
NATO, exchange of information, research and
doctrine, the development of channels of
which
co-operation
and
communication
require consideration from a political as well
as a military point of view.
The present indication appears to be that
this line of work will not decrease, but
rather that it will grow as our commitments
begin to take shape. In fact, so rapid has
been our recent growth in this field that
our defence program is four times greater
today than it was prior to the aggression in
Korea.
Out of this unusual growth of the defence
department has emerged a more clearly
defined division of the functions of its head:
first, the detailed administration of the
department and it branches and, secondly, the
broader over-all respects, including policy
and relations with foreign governments. It
is proposed, therefore, that the latter shall
continue to fall within the scope of the Minister of National Defence, and the former
under the new associate minister.
In brief, the duties of the new associate
minister will therefore include action on the
ministers behalf when the minister is absent
from the country, and the exercise of powers
dealing with matters of administration and
supervision of the three services. These will
include requisitions for construction equipment and supplies, submissions on similar
matters to the Governor in Council and to
the Treasury Board, control of the establishment, appointment and supervision of civil
employees and service personnel, approval of
expenditures, orders, instructions and plans
within the lines of agreed policy.
I am sure honourable senators will appreciate the heavy load required to be carried

by the present Minister of National Defence
and the desirability of providing assistance
through this proposed appointment of an
associate. Now that the main lines of division of responsibility have been established
with the development of our defence program, it is easier to appreciate the objects
for which the legislation is being introduced.
Notwithstanding this division of responsibility
the minister and his associate will work
closely together so that each will be
thoroughly familiar, not necessarily with the
details, but with the general line of the
operation of the whole department and of
the three services.
Honourable senators, with these objects in
view I commend this legislation to your
early consideration and, I hope, approval.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask the honourable
leader opposite a question? Could he tell the
bouse how many Canadian soldiers, airmen
and navy personnel are now stationed in
Korea and in Western Europe?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I do not seem to have
the information here, but I could get it for
my honourable friend. I may say-though this
does not answer the question-my recollection is, that of the estimated expenditures
for the armed forces this year the amount
allotted to the air force is considerably more
than is allotted to the navy and army combined. I will undertake to get the answer to
the honourable leader's specific question.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I do not intend to delay the house for long.
From the remarks of the minister, which
I heard from the gallery of the other place,
I gather that he is anxious that this bill be
passed as soon as possible.
I take somewhat the same position in this
matter as that taken by the opposition in
another place-not that I usually copy opposition or any other parties-namely, that the
new minister should be of equal rank with
the present minister. I do not think there
should be any distinction in rank between
the two, otherwise it will lead to disputesnot between the men themselves, but between
organizations. I certainly agree, however, that
an additional minister should be appointed.
I was disturbed by an article I read in
this morning's paper on the proportion of
rejected men out of the total who presented
themselves for enlistment in the army, navy
and air force. The figure was startling.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Extraordinary.

FEBRUARY 10, 1953
Hon. Mr. Haig: If the House of Commons
does not have time to inquire into this question I think this house should look into it
and find the reason why so many young men
are rejected for military service. My mnemory
of the figure is that it was somewhere in the
order of two-thirds of the total applicants
for service.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Not that many.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: A little less than half.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Let us say 40 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Howard: The proportion was
somewhere between a third and a half of the
total, but nevertheless startling.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think as it applied to
the army, it was more than half. This house
should seek to find the reason for that situation. I take it that these men are, being
rejected on the basis of physical disability of
some kind. If there is any other reason for
it, we should know.
Hon. Mr. Vien: If the honourable senator
will allow me, I may say that the figures in
Canada compare quite favourably with those
in the United States and other countries. The
number of rejects in the United States is
equally surprising.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That may be true, but a
country with the standard of living which
Canada enjoys should be developing healthy
men.
Hon. Mr. Vien: That is true.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Our climate and living conditions are most favourable. It must be
remembered that some 40 per cent of the
young men who are rejected remain at home
and become the fathers of the next generation, while the physically fit go to Korea
or elsewhere and some of them-thank God,
not many-never come back. At my time of
life it is a problem that disturbs me very
much.
I say again that the measure before us should
provide for an additional minister equal in
rank to the present minister. From newspaper articles I gather that the present
minister is to be engaged largely in world
affairs having to do with NATO and other
international defence programs, including
such matters as the type of guns to be used
and the number of radar screens to be placed
in northern Canada.
The details of the
organization, I take it, will fall on the
shoulders of the associate minister. For my
part, I would like to see the duties specifically
set out. I presurne either one of the ministers
will dominate, but which one, we do not
know. True, in private business there is
a manager, who really runs the business, and

under him an assistant manager, who helps
him and carries out his orders.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Who is going to be boss
in this instance?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I would like to know who
is going to be the boss, but nobody can
answer that question.
During the recent great war those of us
who had a son in the air force felt pretty
secure when we knew he was under "Chubby"
Power. I suppose those whose sons were
under the heads of the army and navy also
felt a degree of confidence. But at this time,
when our country is called upon to spend
such huge sums of money in preparation for
war, I think we should have not two ministers,
but three, to look after the various branches
of the armed forces. There should be one
man to look after the supplies, though I do
not know what his proper title would be.
The situation in the Far East must be
brought to a head, or we shall continue in
this state of war throughout our lifetime. I
agree with the people of the United States
when they say something definite has to be
done about it, or Stalin and his satellites will
win the cold war. He has only to give the
people under him a living in return for their
services, while our economy is being stretched
to the limit by the cost of maintaining our
forces. Frankly, I do not believe that we
can continue spending at the rate we are
now spending.
This bill brings to my mind the question
of who is to spend the money, the present
minister or the associate minister. I repeat,
there should be a third minister appointed at
this time. While I do not intend to vote against
the measure, I am opposed to there being two
ministers, one subordinate to the other.
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators,
I think there is much to be said in support
of the remarks of the honourable leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig). The war machine
is so vast that it is beyond the capacity of
one man to exercise effective control over the
intricate agencies that he must supervise.
My own opinion is that there should be a
Minister of National Defence, and Associate
Ministers for Air, for the Navy, and for the
Army, and that by this means there would
be achieved that unity of command which
must exist if discipline and effectiveness are
to characterize the management of the various
departments.
As regards rivalry between various
branches of the service, I am of opinion
that it does not exist in Canada to anything
like the same extent as elsewhere. I know
that these tensions are extremely acute in

SENATE
some other countries, but, so far as I have
been able to ascertain, there is great harmony
between the three services in this country.
High officers, and lower-ranking officers as
well, in al the three branches speak of one
another with a great deal of respect and of
esprit de corps. But, as I have said, it might
greatly assist the efficiency of the services
if there were an associate minister for each
branch.
As regards the question who is in command,
I do not believe that it arises. The Minister
of National Defence is certainly in command,
and determines the policies of his department, and it is the function of an associate
minister to help him to discharge his onerous
duties. I doubt that it would be wise to give
equal authority to these ministers. There
must be one who rules; and the question
which has been put would probably be much
more cogent if there were two ministers
operating with equal power. I doubt whether
that system would be workable. I would
prefer the system which, if I mistake not,
obtains in England: there is a Minister of
War who is a member of the Cabinet, and
two other ministers, not holding cabinet rank,
in charge of various branches of the service.
What I have in mind to suggest is that the
Minister of National Defence should have
assistants in each branch of the service, and
at ministerial level, so as to have proper
authority in their respective branches.
The honourable leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) also offered the suggestion,
with which I agree, that the Senate-through,
for instance, our Committee on Public Health
and Welfare-could very properly study the
conditions revealed by the rejection on
grounds of physical unfitness of so many
applicants for enlistment in one or other
branches of the service. As has been said, it
might be appropriate, for the better understanding of the question, to call in officers
who could give us accurate information on
every aspect of the matter.
I am not over-disturbed by these conditions,
although I regret that they exist. I recall
that in 1917 and 1918, when compulsory
service was in force, the number of persons
disqualified for health reasons was surprisingly large; and the same state of things
obtained during the second world war. I may
say that I have read similar comments about
the large number of applicants in other
countries-which I do not wish to namewho were rejected because of physical unfitness. It would seem that our climate, our
ways of life, and living conditions should
make for a healthy people, and on the whole,
I suppose, Canadians are a healthy folk. But
the very strenuous duties required of our
soldiers under modern conditions of warfare

require that they be more than ordinarily
fit, and of course the physical qualifications
expected of them include, not only health, but
strength and physical fitness for the tasks
which confront them. I repeat that I am
not over-disturbed. But I would welcome
an investigation which would lead us to
adopt remedies that might be useful.
I would point out that as a general rule
health is a matter of provincial jurisdiction,
and I do not like the idea of the federal
parliament dealing with matters which, under
the British North America Act, are not
primarily its concern. If we want to have
"peace, order and good government," and
contentment as well, we should leave to the
provincial authorities those things which the
British North America Act has assigned to
their jurisdiction. There has been a marked
tendency to mix federal and provincial
matters. I would welcome a policy which
would tend to "cease and desist" from such
interference. I am not blaming the federal
government. What it did was done by way
of assistance to the provincial authority. But
this word "assistance" has a wide meaning;
and the Liberal party has always objected
to the giving away of public money unless
the government takes responsibility for the
spending of it. It would be a sound and wise
policy for this government and for this
parliament to mind their own business and
to remain within the sphere of their attributions under the constitution.
Take, for instance, the control of rentalsa provincial matter. The federal government
assumed control because it was contended
that there existed a national emergency with
respect to housing. Well, living conditions
in Halifax, Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal,
and other cities are not alike, and an urgency
in one part of the country does not imply
the existence of an urgency elsewhere. In
respect of health as well as other matters,
if we leave to the provinces the task which
is theirs we shall, I think, be wise and
well advised.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read a third time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Next sitting.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. Salter A. Hayden moved the second
reading of Bill U-3, an Act respecting the
Detroit' and Windsor Subway Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
very simple. The Detroit and Windsor Subway Company was incorporated by a special

FEBRUARY 10, 1953
statute of the Parliament of Canada in 192627. Some question of ambiguity or doubt
has arisen as to the scope of the powers of
sale provided in the original act of incorporation. At this time it is also desired to have
defined more clearly the powers in connection
with any public authority that may acquire
by sale the properties and assets which are
operated by this company. These provisions
are accordingly set forth in the bill before
the house.
Another provision in the bill ratifies an
agreement which was made on April 24, 1928,
between the Detroit and Windsor Subway
Company and the Municipal Corporation of
the City of Windsor. This agreement has to
do with the rights of the city of Windsor in
connection with the operation of the subway in accordance with various terms and
conditions outlined in the agreement. The
purpose of the bill before us is to clarify
these points beyond any doubt and to make it
clear that the relevant provisions of the Railway Act apply to the public authority.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Honourable senators,
I move that this bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills.
The motion was agreed to.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. A. K. Hugessen moved the second
reading of Bill V-3, an Act to incorporate
Canadian Reinsurance Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a bill
in the usual form for the incorporation of a
company to carry on the usual kinds of
insurance business other than life insurance.
The company is to be known as Canadian
Reinsurance Company.
The names of the incorporators who appear
in the bill are those of three young members
of a well-known legal firm in Montreal; but
the interests promoting this legislation are
a very large and responsible Swiss concern
known as the Swiss Reinsurance Company,
which, I am informed, is the largest professional reinsurer in the world. For many
years past this company has had reinsurance
connections with agents and others in the
reinsurance business in Canada, but it now
proposes to enter directly into the field of
reinsurance here, and it seeks to do so
through the incorporation of the company
named in the bill.
68112-15

As honourable senators will observe, the
authorized capital of the company is to be $1
million. The whole of that authorized capital
is to be paid up at once, and the company
is also to have a capital surplus of an additional $1 million. In other words, $2 million
of foreign capital will immediately be placed
in the company. I understand that this legislation is in the ordinary form of insurance
bills of this kind, and I am informed that it
has received the approval of the Superintendent of Insurance. If the bill is given
second reading, I will propose that it be
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, where questions which
may occur to honourable members may be
answered.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: What does the honourable
senator mean by a reinsurance company? As
I understand it, a reinsurance company does
not accept primary business but reinsures for
other companies.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I am not an insurance
man but I understand that a reinsurance company is not a primary insurer but one which
takes from primary insurers a part of their
load. It is a widely accepted form of insurance, particularly in cases of large risks,
as it spreads them over a considerable
number of reinsurers.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Then this reinsurance
company would not be in the competitive
field?
Hon; Mr. Hugessen: I am not prepared to
say whether there are any other reinsurance
companies in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: There is Lloyd's of
London.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Would the honourable
senator who explained the bill (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) tell us why there is such a low
capital? A company certainly could not do
much reinsurance business with $1 million
capital, or even the capital of $3 million to
which the company may increase its stock
under the bill. That would still be a mere
drop in the bucket.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: As I explained, $2
million is to be paid up right away; $1 million
in capital and another $1 million as a surplus.
In other words, the company will start with
a fund of $2 million. I understand that in
the case of insurance companies the relation
of the actual capital invested to the amount
of funds with which the companies deal is
not very close. In other words, once a company starts getting premiums it enjoys the
use of a much larger amount of money than

SENATE

is required as the original capital of the
company. I do not think the amount of
proposed capital here is out of line with the
initial capital of a number of other companies carrying on this kind of business.

NATIONAL DEFENCE BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the third reading of Bill 103, an Act to amend the National
Defence Act.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
STATISTICS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Norman P. Lambert moved the second
reading of Bill S-3, an Act to amend the
Statistics Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill has
to do with a number of operations of the
Dominion Bureau of Statistics, but it in no
way affects the status of the bureau or curtails its work. It simply provides the technique
to be employed by the bureau in making its
periodic reports to the government and to the
country.
If honourable senators require any further
details than I am able to give of the various
clauses in the bill, I am assured by the head
of the bureau that he will be glad to appear
before a committee and furnish further
information.
Clause 1 of the bill by providing for the
inclusion of the word "persons", along with
"goods, wares or merchandise by land, water
or air", in paragraph (b) of section 2 of the

SENATE
act, will permit the collection of statistics
on the transportation of passengers as well
as of goods. The word "persons" was inadvertently omitted from the amended act of
1947-48. Subclause 2 of this clause would
delete the reference to pipe lines. That term,
it appears, comes automatically under the
category of carriers, and is taken care of in
the phrase "land, water or air", appearing in
paragraph (b) of clause 1 (1).
Clause 2 of the bill has to do with section 5
of the act, and relates to the services of
officers of other departments of the government in performance of duties under the
provision of the Statistics Act. This clause
would give to the minister power to authorize
an officer of another department to act as
an officer of the bureau in the execution of
duties under this act. The addition of this
subclause would make officers from other
departments employed in this manner subject to the secrecy requirements imposed on
the regular officers of the bureau. Some suggestion has been made that this would result
in an encroachment upon or invasion of the
information held by the income tax branch
of the Department of National Revenue. I
am assured, however, that it would not do
that.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the honourable gentleman whether this clause would
place officers of other departments under the
direction of the bureau?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: It would.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: And must they act when
asked to do so?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: They must. This clause
applies to such departments as Trade and
Commerce, Finance, and Agriculture, as well
as the Bank of Canada, any one of which
might desire information from the bureau;
in which case, officers of any one of these
departments or of the bank would, under
this clause, be free to serve in the bureau in
helping to compile desired information.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Are they obligated to
do so?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: They would be, upon
the request or at the suggestion, not of the
bureau but of the minister of any of the
departments concerned.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Then there would be
a division of authority between two ministers,
would there not? If a minister of one department can boss officials of another department, where do we draw our line?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The honourable senator
must realize that the Dominion Bureau of
Statistics is only a branch under the Department of Trade and Commerce. It does not

enjoy the same status as certain other institutions, like the National Research Council
and the Central Mortgage and iousng Corporation, which have direct access to the minister. The statistics branch, however, has
virtually the status of a deputy minister's
position. However, what it is intended to
legalize under the secrecy clause of the
Statistics Act are any services which might be
rendered to another department by the
Bureau of Statistics in giving it information
required from time to time. I do not think
any division of authority is involved.
Clause 3 of the bill relates to the secrecy
clauses of the Statistics Act. The new paragraph (b) of subsection (3) of section 15 of
the act would permit the publication of information given by hospitals and other noncommercial institutions which, for the maximum use of such information, must be related to the individual institutions. Returns
from these institutions are already made,
but it is desired to have more detailed information relating to numbers of patients,
classes of illness and cases of recovery and
mortality; and the bill would legalize the
furnishing of this data in relation to the
individual institutions which are now required to report to the bureau.
Paragraph (c) another new paragraph of
this subsection, permits the bureau to publish
lists of co-operating firms together with their
locations and the kinds of business in which
they are engaged. The lists would not reveal
any other information regarding the business of these individual firms. All parties
concerned with the filing of such information
recognize favourably the increasingly important part that the bureau has to play in providing information for use in the conduct
of business. Some of the advantages which
would arise from the adoption of this clause
may be cited, because from time to time
some criticism has been expressed here and
there as to the amount of information that
is demanded by the bureau in its questionnaires. I think that that objection, or irritation, caused by extra detailed work that
the questionnaires necessitate in business
offices, has been rapidly disappearing, because
now one hears very little of it. But the
advantages may be mentioned.
First, a list of firms included in the tables
of the report is very useful for the interpretation of the statistics contained in that report.
The list enables users of the report to see
just what the table covers, what firms are
included and what firms are excluded.
Secondly, people who are in the market for
commodities often inquire where they can
get them; and the bureau, because of its
close contact with business firms, is becoming exceptionally well fitted to supply such

FEBRUARY 11, 1953
information. A third advantage relates to
inquiries from firms that want to know where
they can sell their goods; and the bureau is
regarded as a useful source of information
in this field too. Lastly, the publication of
trade lists helps the bureau to keep its
information up to date, and in that way to
serve those who write in to say that they
manufacture certain articles to which the
lists refer and wish to be included in them.
Clause 4 of the bill deletes section 19 of
the present act, which has to do with the
taking of the censuses.
Here again the
attempt is to curtail the number of questions
asked by the census enumerators, and to
consolidate and make more useful the
information already available in the bureau
relating to values of farm products and the
amount of farm expenses.
Hon. Mr. Reid: In this section three provinces, and three only, are definitely mentioned. It reads thatEach census of population and agriculture shall
be sa taken as ta ascertain with the utmost possible
accuracy for the various territorial divisions of
Canada, or of the provinces, of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta . . .

Why are those provinces specifically mentioned?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I am afraid I cannot
answer that at the moment. Some further
light on the point may be given by officials
of the department.
Hon. Mr. Sambaugh: In the prairie provinces the census is held every five years, as
against every ten years in the other
provinces.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is so.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Thank you very much
for that information.
Clause 5 provides for an addition to section 22 of the act, to authorize the collection
of statistics of commerce and navigation on
inland waterways or in connection with the
coastal trade. More complete information
than has been received in the past regarding
the movement of tonnage and vessels is needed
to supply the demand for such data.
Clauses 6, 7 and 8 are simply amendments
of sections 28, 29 and 31 of the act for the
purpose of giving greater flexibility in the
collection of criminal statistics. Criminal
statistics include: the number of cases before
the courts, returns from prisons and penitentiaries of the number of prisoners, the
number of pardons, and other details. It is
desired to add to the data already obtained
under this section.
That covers the eight proposed amendments
to Part I of the bill. Part II is merely a
repetition of these amendments for the technical purpose of making them consistent with

the Revised Statutes of Canada for 1952,
which are now on the press.
In concluding my remarks on the proposed
amendments contained in the bill, I suggest
that the Senate might appropriately associate
itself at this time with a few further and
broader references to the Dominion Bureau
of Statistics.
We in this chamber have good reason to
appreciate the work of the bureau in relation
to the valuable reports that have been made
to parliament by our Standing Committee on
Finance and sponsored by its chairman, the
honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar). As the result of his stimulating
influence and the information supplied by the
bureau, we have become almost blasé in our
use of such terms as "gross national production" and "net national income" of the
country.

But apart from that, and in all seriousness,
I feel that the members of this chamber and
the public outside should be made aware of
the increasingly important role in the life of
this country which is now filled by the
Dominion Bureau of Statistics. I have not
time to review fully the history of this branch
of the public service, but it is an interesting
story. It goes back to the year of confederation, when statistics were mentioned in
the British North America Act as a matter of
federal jurisdiction and concern. The first
federal legislation on the subject was the
Census Act of 1870. In 1879 the Census and
Statistics Act was passed, and the Minister
of Agriculture was designated as its responsible administrator. Then in 1905 a new
Census and Statistics office was established,
and the newly formed provinces of the middle
west were included as areas for census
enumeration.
It was not until 1918, however, that the
real foundations of the present Bureau of
Statistics were laid. In that year a new act
was passed. The Dominion Bureau, headed
by a newly appointed Dominion Statistician,
was established, to be under the Minister of
Trade and Commerce instead of the Minister
of Agriculture. The names of Sir George
Foster as minister, and Robert H. Coats, the
first Dominion Statistician, must always be
associated with the establishment of our
present statistical service on firm and adaptable national foundations. Dr. Coats is now
retired, but continues to take an active
advisory interest in the development of the
bureau. He brought distinguished recognition to Canada from statistical and scientific
organizations at home and abroatd. His successors likewise have continued to enjoy high
prestige. Election to the presidency of such

SENATE

organizations as the American Economic
Association, the American Statistical Association, and the United Nations Statistical Association have marked the honour and respect
in which Canada is held in this international
field. Just recently the bureau was host here
in Ottawa to two great international conferences representing statistical scientists from
fifty different countries. Officers of the
bureau have been associated during the past
fifteen years with services given on official
invitation to the governments of such countries as Abyssinia, Burma, Lebanon, Colombia,
Chile and Indonesia, where the organization
of statistical systems has been desired.
It should be mentioned that in 1948 a new
Statistics Act was placed on the Statutes of
that year, under chapter 45. The war period
and the immediate postwar years brought
many additional permanent responsibilities
upon the bureau, and the act of 1948 simply
embodied new provisions to take care of
enlarged demands for information. The act
was simply brought up to date and did not
disturb the fundamental scientific principles
upon which it had been founded. The practice of statistical sampling which had been
widely employed for some time was definitely
recognized and legalized in 1948.
Some of the new undertakings which the
war years brought to the bureau were statistics of unemployment insurance: a national
index of births and deaths in connection with
family allowances; health costs for the department of health and welfare; forecasts of
capital investment expenditures; transfer of
tourist records from the customs department;
development of statistical data relating to
agricultural prices and farm income; and an
enlarged index of consumer prices. And, of
course, we are all acquainted with that everexpanding volume, the Canada Year Book,
which has brought recognition and credit to
its compilers.
It can be fairly said today that in ber
Bureau of Statistics, recently housed in a
modern plant which was long overdue, Canada has a service whose efficiency and high
standing are second to none in the world.
The history of this branch of the federal
government service reflects more accurately
than anything else the material growth and
requirements of our country. It also has a
most pertinent bearing upon the administrative development of our different branches of
government. The Bureau of Statistics in a
quiet, unostentatious manner has had great
unifying influence upon relations between the
provinces and the dominion. The story behind
the vital statistics, the census, the compilation of records in connection with grain
crops and other agricultural products, and

the periodical reports on national employment and unemployment, constitutes an eloquent tribute to the potential underlying
desire of the people of Canada -as a whole to
co-operate in developing a strong and intelligent nation.
In social, financial and economic fields the
bureau has become in reality a reliable and
trustworthy barometer, registering trends
and portents in the life of this country.
It is a guide not only to government, but to
private enterprise and business as well.
Finally, one might say it represents the
application of a great branch of modern
science to the development and progress of
Canada, at a time when the guiding hand of
this science is essential to our present and
future economy.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Will the honourable
gentleman tell us how much the bureau costs?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I do not have the cost
figures, but I know that the bureau has
effected an economy of $1,200,000 in the
reorganization of census-taking. The total
maintenance expenditure figures are obtainable.
The average number of employees in the
bureau is 1,300, but at census-taking time
there are 18,000 employees.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I should like first to congratulate the mover
of the second reading upon the able way in
which he has presented this bill to the
house.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I appreciated his remarks
very much, especially the latter part of them.
I am not going to try to paint the lily, but
wish merely to express a few personal
thoughts about the bureau.
I was much interested to read recently
that that famous woman Florence Nightingale was the first person ever to use statistics
to win a great case. Honourable senators are
familiar with the story of ber famous nursing
career during the Crimean war of 1854-56,
and we have all read about the terrific death
rate in the military hospitals during that war.
Upon ber return to England she decided
to look into what was happening in the
military hospitals and barracks of that country. She learned that the average death
rate per thousand men in such famous
British regiments as the Coldstream Guards,
while they were stationed in barracks, was
double that of the ordinary population outside.
She studied the situation further and compiled exact figures for each barracks and for
the districts from which the men had come.

FEBRUARY 11, 1953
Her findings were so stunning that the parliament of Britain flot only adopted her views,
but completely revolutionized the army medical services. She had won her case by gathering and presenting statistics.
We have listened to commendation of the
Bureau of Statistics for many of its very
useful activities, but I should like to refer
at this point to one of the iess desirable
features of the bureau's work. I cail to, mind
the case of a small merchant; on St. Matthews
avenue, in my dear city of Winnipeg, who
runs that type of store which stays open until
nine o'clock each evening. A bachelor, he
has his landlady corne in froxn twelve to, one
and frorn six to seven, while he leaves to
eat his meals. This past summer he received
f romn the Bureau of Statisties papers and
documents which would have taken hlm two
weeks to complete, and even then they would
not have been reliable. Naturally, I told hlm
to throw the stuif in the wastebasket and
leave it there. Why should the bureau ask
that man to give it figures on how snuch
milk and how much butter he sells, when
tho.se figures could easîly be obtained from
the large milk distributors and bakers in
that city?, I presurne such difficulties as that
can be ironed out.
On the other side of the pictuùre, the Bureau
of Statistics is of great help to, an opposition
in parliament. In compiling figures the opposition does not have avaîlable to it the
machinery that a minister of the government
has. That has been clearly indicated by my
honourable friend from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert), but I just want to, emphasize what
he said. At the last two or three sessions
the honourable senator from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar), chairman of the Finance Comnmittee, was able through the bureau to bring
before us an exhaustive f und of information:
at committee meetings the bureau's officers
seemed to have at their fingertips just what
we wanted to know. I arn quite sure, of
course, that the honourable senator knew
very well where in any event he could get
whatever information he desired, but the
bureau was most helpful to the whole comnmittee, especially to members of the opposition.
In conclusion, 1 express the hope that this
bill will be referred to, the appropriate coinmittee, s0 that we may have a full explanation fromn officers of the bureau. I amn
interested in having a further explanation,
flot so much for the benefit of honourable
senators as for the benefit of the general
public. Any person who contemplates entering a particular field of business needs to, get
authentic information on the developrnents
in it. The bureau should be given as much

ipublicity as Possible so that the people of
Canada will know what is available to them.
I arn wholeheartedly ini support of the
bill but, like the sponsor, I do not entirely
comprehend it. I do flot think it is possible
to read arnendinents out of their context
and understand them; it is necessary to have
someone go over them and explain their
effect.
If the bill is referred to committee, I for
one shaîl be on hand to, help the sponsor
encourage the bureau in the work that it is
doing, and I shahl do what I can to, tell the
public about that work.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, a
cursory examination of the amendments proposed to the Statistics Act gives me the
impression that they are designed to provide
more fiexibility in the administration of the
act. That seems to, me a whohhy desirable
thing to, do.
Without going into the meaning or purposes
of the various amendments so carefully outlined by the honourable senator frorn Ottawa,
I merehy wish to, draw the attention of the
house to, one section on which I think further
information should be sougbt in comniittee.
I refer to the proposed amendment to section
5 of the act, by which. the minister who has
the administration of the act-who I behieve
is the Minister of Trade and Commerce-may
caîl upon the services of any member of the
public service of Canada.
Perhaps I can make it clearer if I read the
proposed amendment:
(2) The minister may, for such periods as he may
determine, utilîze the services of any member of
the publie service of Canada in the exercise or
performance of any duty, power or function of the
bureau or officer of the bureau under this or any
other act, arnd every person whose services are so
utilized shall, for the purposes of this act, be
deemed to be employed under this act.

That rnay be ail right, but I thînk the
if I
amendment should be scrutinized.
understand it -aright, the Minister of Trade
and Commerce may call upon some employee
in a department under another ministerfor instance, in the Department of Finance,
or the Departrnent of National RevenueHon. Mr. Euler: Or the income tax branch.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes,-and may require
that servant of another department to work
for the tirne being for the Bureau of Statistics. If that is the meaning of the amendment, it appears to, me to raise the possibility
of confiict between two departmnents o! governrnent. That, I think, is a matter which
shouhd be inquired into.
Apart fromn that single instance, it is my
impression that these amendments are

SENATE
intended to give more flexibility to the
act and, consequently, will improve its
administration.
While I am on this subject, I would like to
endorse fully what our colleague from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) has said about the value
of the Bureau of Statistics and the services
it renders to the economic life of the country.
A person who wants it may get information
upon almost any phase of our industrial and
economic activity. For example, information
available in the bureau is very complete in
providing data about the movement of real
wages in Canada, and the reasons underlying
the steady improvement of the lot of the
labouring man can be readily deduced from
a study of the material. Statistics of agricultural production and related matters are
of great importance to any Canadian, and
particularly to a member of parliament who
wishes to inform himself on what is really
happening in the country of which he is a
parliamentary representative.
The worth of the bill was demonstrated,
for instance, in the work of the Rowell-Sirois
Commission. I have always believed that the
report of that commission is one of the great
state papers of this country: it ranks with
anything that has been produced in relation
to the development of Canada. In passing
I might say that it has always been to me a
matter of regret that, for reasons I need not
here enter into, the main recommendation of
that report, concerning the financial relationships between the dominion and the provinces,
has not to this day been really implemented.
The data which had to be studied in reaching
the agreements that now exist in relation to
financial matters between nine of the provinces and the federal government came very
largely from the Bureau of Statistics. As
regards matters affecting the relationship
between the federal government and the
provinces, and, indeed, the municipalities, it
is of the first importance to have clear and
reliable factual material upon which conclusions can be reached and judgments
formed, and in all these matters the Bureau
of Statistics renders a very vital service.
I might also make mention of the information available through the bureau in relation
to our external trade, another matter of the
greatest importance to Canada. There may
be some foundation for criticisms which at
times are levelled against the bureau. The
human mind is fallible, and it is always possible to over-extend yourself. So I do not
deny that the criticism expressed by the
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) a
few minutes ago may have some valid ground.
I can conceive that a statistical mind, dealing
with a subject of broad import, may range

very widely and include a good deal of data
which is of doubtful relevance. But allowances must be mace in these matters, and wiUi
time, no doubt, public opinion will correct
the anomalies that arise through procedures
of that kind.
I can only echo what was so well said by
the honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert) as to the valuable contribution
which the bureau makes to the whole life of
our Canadian people; and I, for one, shall
approach the consideration of these amendments in committee with full sympathy and
every desire to assist in the further development of this most useful institution.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Honourable senators, if
no one else wishes to speak there are two
or three points I should like to cover. In
reply to the question raised by the honourable
gentleman from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck), I would say that the estimates
for 1954 put the cost of maintaining the
Bureau of Statistics at $5,534,000. This is
a reduction of $454,000 from the previous
year.
In reference to the point raised by my
honourable friend from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) with regard to the employment
of officials from other departments to compile information desired by their ministers,
I think the real purpose of this amendment
is to economize rather than to increase expenditures. The tendency has been for a good
many departments to set up their own statistical service and their own statistical bureau.
I know that was true of the Rowell-Sirois
Commission to which my honourable colleague referred.
That commission set up
its own statistical bureau in the person of
the late Mr. Alex Skelton, who was loaned
to the commission by the Bank of Canada,
which also had a separate bureau of statistics. I recall that the Dominion Statistician
said to me at that time that for $10,000 his
bureau could have covered the whole field of
investigation and taken advantage of all the
work that had been done in the past to
assemble the same kind of data that was collected under the commission. I believe that
to be true. However, all government departments are today looking to the Bureau of
Statistics for service, and I think that is a
good development.
It tends to eliminate
the overlapping that has existed in many
respects.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The Department of
Labour does a great deal of statistical work.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Yes. In my reference
to the historical background of the bureau
I might have pointed out that the early
statistical work in connection with the administration of the government originated in the

of friends and admirers. He is somewhat of
a poet, and dictates his verse to a stenographer. A collection of lis poems printed
in a small illustrated folder added $8,000 to
the Callow cigarette fund.
On entering Walter's room I am greeted
by the blind man with a cheery, "Is that you,
Gordon? I know your voice". From then
on he talks constantly of his aims and plans.
I recall vividly how he would talk of a
wheelchair coach, and of his plans te have
the coach built in such a way that sufferers
on wheelchairs would be able to enter it without the least discomfort to themselves. It
was then that his great brain and God-like
patience, and a heart full of love for suff ering
humanity, devised what is now known as the
"Callow ramp". This device permits helpless wheelchair cripples to enter the coach
and be driven to such places of enjoyment
as the beaches along the sea coast of Nova
Scotia, and beautiful Annapolis Valley in
apple-blossom time; as well as to baseball,
football and hockey games.
Walter Callow has dreamed of having his
invention benefit all sections of Canada, and
through this bill he seeks permission to
extend his activities throughout the whole
dominion.
It is inspiring to think of a man unable to
see, or touch, or ever to walk again, who,
after an illness of twenty-three years, continues through his courage and faith to bring
hiappiness to thousands of others. I can
safely say that Walter Callow spends his
every waking moment dreaming up ways to
brighten the lives of other cripples, both
veterans and civilians. During all the years
since his flying accident lie has lived thus,
thinking of others. His proudest achievement to date is the invention of the Walter
Callow wheelchair coach.
A word here about the Walter Callow
coach. He designed it, and the first one was
built in Nova Scotia under his exacting direction. The wheelchairs, twelve to each coach,
also are designed by Callow. The 5ack of
the coach becomes a hydraulic ramp, which
is lowered to permit wheelchairs to comé
aboard easily. They are then locked into
position to avoid any possibility of accident.
The latest coaches, now being built in
Quebec, are fitted with eight basket stretchers,
similar to those used by the air force, so that
it is possible to carry twenty stretchers in
each if desired.
I might mention that special facilities in
the form of a glass pavilion have been constructed at the Halifax Forum for the benefit
of Camp Hill wheelchair patients, so that
veterans and others can enjoy pleasures

which otherwise would be denied to them.
I remember well having the pleasure and
pilvilege uf being present with a group of
veterans watching games at the forum in
Halifax. I was amply repaid for going there
by observing the happy expressions on the
faces of those veterans who, but for these
conveniences, would not have been able to
attend the games.
Incidentally, I might mention that in the
event of an emergency the coaches with completely trained staffs will be turned over to
the civil defence authorities.
Walter Callow is known affectionately to
his fellow Nova Scotians as the "human log".
Hour after hour, day after day, year after
year, he lies motionless. If, for instance, a
fly lit on his nose lie could do nothing about
it. Think of it: a man without mobility and
without sight has invented a coach for the
comfort of crippled folk. But the invention
of this coach is only one of the seeming
miracles this man has accomplished.
I wish honourable senators could have been
with me recently when I visited Camp Hill
hospital and saw Walter Callow lying in his
hospital bed with a pen strapped to his hand
by adhesive tape supported by scotch tape,
striving to sign his name in order that this
petition might be presented. Had honourable
senators been with me on that occasion, I
would not have had to say anything further
concerning this wonderful man. Lying almost
completely paralyzed, and motionless but
for a slow jerky movement of his index
finger, Walter Callow signed this petitionthe first time he had written his name in
twenty-three long years. The signing of the
petition was done before representatives of
the press, radio and film news operators, who
had gathered in his sound-proof office in Camp
Hill hospital annex. The passage of this bill
will bring closer to reality Walter's dream of
the league's organization on an international
basis.
In closing, may I say that one thing is sure:
in no man is there a heart more overflowing
with humanity. Walter is a personality and
a power. He has made famous his hospital,
his city and his province. Blind, helpless in
limb and body, he sums up his own case in
these words:
1 could be a lot worse.
I want to thank God
that at least I can talk and think. I want to repay
Him because after a man dies he will be asked
only one question: 'What did you do for others?'

I am reminded of a telephone call I
received one day last fall. Answering it,
I heard Walter's voice; and this is what he
said: "Thought I would let you know, Gordon,
that I am going to the operating room tomorrow morning at nine o'clock. I do not know

FEBRUARY 11, 1953
whether it is to be one leg or two which
they will amputate." The next time I saw
him both his legs had been amputated. But
he was the same cheerful fellow I had seen
the first day I visited his hospital room, many,
many years ago.
That, honourable senators, is part of the
story behind the bill of which I now move

asked only one question, 'What did you do for

What courage, what selflessness, what an
object lesson to all of us who are more
fortunate!

fact that an application for a charter was
to be made in the Senate was commented
upon in these words:

SENATE
INDIAN BILL
iviuOi±N

FOR

SECOND

A

BILL WITHDRAWN
The Senate resumed from Thursday,
February 5, the adjourned debate on the
motion of Hon. Mr. Ross for the second reading of Bill Z, an Act to amend the Indian Act.
Hon. Wishar± McL. Roberison: Honourable
senators, I regret very much that, as a result
of the position which I occupy, it is my
responsibility to officially express dissent from
the principle of the bill which was moved by
the honourable senator from Calgary (Hon.
Mr. Ross). I express my regret because I
realize that my honourable friend takes a
very active part in legislative matters, and
under other circumstances it certainly would
not be my disposition*to oppose the principle
of the motion he has made.
I oppose it for two reasons. The first is
that an undertaking was given to the Indians
themselves in 1951, when the Indian Act was
passed, that there would be no change affecting their rights until after a trial of two years,
and after a further conference with tbem.
This, incidentally, is a point which they
immediately raised against this bill. No
sooner had my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Ross) spoken to his bill than the Honourable
W. E. Harris, the minister concerned, received
from the president of the North American
Indian Brotherhood, representations that
adoption of the bill by parliament would
violate the undertaking which the minister
had given in that respect. The minister did
not bind parliament, of course, but under
these circumstances I should think that it
would be a serious matter to break his undertaking, which was a very natural one.
My other reason has to do with the question of the specific amendment itself.
In 1951, prior to passage of the present
Indian Act, the Honourable Mr. Harris
convened a representative meeting of the
Indians of Canada at which the proposed
legislation was reviewed, and the Indians
were given an opportunity to make comments
and suggestions. Certain provisions of the
proposed act, particularly some of those
affecting the rights of Indians, did not meet
with their approval, but they were advised
by Mr. Harris that the government intended,
if the bill was passed by parliament, to give
the act a trial of at least two years. Mr.
Harris promised that after the trial period
he would be prepared to consider representations from the Indians regarding amendments
to the act.
Since the act came into force the government has become aware of the desirability
of amending certain of its provisions, but,

in keeping with the promise made to the
Indians, has postponed taking amending
action, except in one minor instance. I refer
to the bill which honourable senators may
recall was passed by parliament just before
the Christmas adjournment. It was, as I said,
a very minor amendment, and it did not take
away from the Indians any rights and
privileges extended to them under the act.
If the bill which has been proposed by the
honourable senator from Calgary (Hon. Mr.
Ross) should pass, it would affect the rights
of Indians, who certainly would view the
passing of the bill as a breach of Mr. Harris'
promise that they be given an opportunity
to make representations when the Indian Act
was being reviewed, some time after it had
been in operation for two years.
On the point of the amendments themselves, it has been suggested to me that the
proposed bill may be interpreted as enabling
judgment creditors of an Indian to execute
their judgments against his real property on
an Indian reserve. This is not possible, as
an Indian does not hold title to real property
on a reserve. Title to all reserves is vested
in the crown, and the rights in reserve lands
that may be acquired by an Indian in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Act
are rights of occupation and use.
The proposed bill, if passed, would in many
instances have the effect of depriving the
Indian of the chattels with which he must
make his living on his reserve. Generally
speaking, Indians are not as well equipped
by education or experience as are their nonIndian neighbours to earn a livelihood, nor
have they the same field in which to do so
unless they are prepared to leave their
reserves and give up the rights and privileges
extended to them so long as they reside there.
Permission to seize and sell the farm equipment of an Indian as the result of a judgment
against him, would mean either that he would
be forced off his reserve to seek some other
means of livelihood, or the Government of
Canada would have to take care of him and
his family or provide him with equipment
to carry on his farming activities. In short,
the proposed bill would have the effect of
imposing an extra burden on the government,
which is responsible for Indians and their
welf are.
Under the present Indian Act an Indian is
largely protected against high pressure salesmen. The proposed bill would remove this
protection, and it could be expected that
unscrupulous salesmen would find Indian
reserves to be fertile fields for the sale of
merchandise which in many cases would not
be needed by the Indians and which in other
cases would be useless to them. Also today

FEBRUARY 11, 1953

it is not usually possible for an Indian to
run up large store debts, because merchants
will not extend much credit to them; but the
opposite would be the case if the proposed
bill were passed, for there is no doubt that
many Indians would improvidently run up
large accounts without giving much thought
to how they would be paid. Indians have been
protected for generations against creditors,
and if this protection were suddenly withdrawn, many Indians, despite any warnings
that might be given, would not realize what
loss of the protection meant until a bailiff
started seizing and selling the chattels with
which they must earn their livelihood.
In explaining his bill the honourable senator from Calgary made mention of Indians
driving automobiles and becoming involved
in accidents, and escaping liability because
judgments cannot be executed against their
property situated on Indian reserves. The
implication is that Indians are in a unique
position, and that in fairness to the nonIndian residents of Canada this situation
should be changed. The honourable gentleman appears to have overlooked, however,
the many cases where persons of non-Indian
status involved in accidents have no insurance and are virtually execution proof because
they have no property of any value. Cases
are all too numerous where a motorist must
pay for damage to his car occasioned by the
negligence of some other party, simply
because there is no hope of recovering
damages from that party by execution after
the judgment. Recourse here would seem to
lie in the field of provincial jurisdiction.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Some provinces seize cars.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes, and some have
contemplated requiring the driver to place a
bond when his car is licensed. I do not know
how practical that system is, but the solution of this particular problern in respect to
both Indians and non-Indians is largely one
which I think properly falls within the provincial field.
In view of the protest made by Andrew
Paull, the President of the North American
Indian Brotherhood, against any action at
this time, and in the light of the possibility
that the Indian Act will be up for revision
next session, it would seem that the subjectmatter of this bill might well be postponed
and brought before the house at that time.
I would ask the honourable member from
Calgary (Hon. Mr. Ross) if, in view of what
I have said, he would request the consent of
the house to withdraw his motion.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators, I
should like to ask the sponsor of the bill if
he knows how many Indians own and drive
automobiles?
Hon. Mr. Ross: I cannot answer that question.
Hon. Mr. Reid: There are quite a number
in British Columbia.
Hon. Mr. Ross: I know that a great many
own and operate automobiles, but I could not
give any figures.
Hon. Mr. Aseline: May I be permitted to
tell the house of the remedy we have in the
province of Saskatchewan for a situation of
this kind?
Although in the beginning many of us in
that province were strenuously opposed to
the province entering the insurance field, the
government nevertheless saw fit to do so. The
coverage is quite extensive, by reason of the
fact that everyone who applies for an automobile licence is required to pay an additional $10 to get insurance protection.
Hon. Mr. Ross: Public liability insurance?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Public liability insurance, and damages to the extent of $5,000 in
the event of death. If this matter raises a
serious problem in Alberta, the honourable
senator from Calgary might well consider
persuading the government of that province
to enter the insurance field in a limited way.
Of course, even in Saskatchewan one does
not have 100 per cent coverage, but under
such a scheme Indians of Alberta could
obtain a policy, with perhaps certain deductible items, and thereby protect the public in
the event of their negligence in the driving
of automobiles.
Hon. Mr. Ross: Honourable senators, in
view of what has been saidThe Hon. the Speaker: I must call the
attention of honourable senators to the fact
that if the honourable senator from Calgary
(Hon. Mr. Ross) speaks at this time, he will
close the debate on this bill.
Hon. Mr Haig: Question!
Hon. Mr. Ross: Honourable senators, in
view of the undertaking given by the minister, I do not think this bill should carry, and
I would be content to have it withdrawn or
defeated at this time.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The proper procedure
would be to ask for the consent of the house
to have it withdrawn.
Hon. Mr. Ross: With the consent of the
house, I would ask that this bill be withdrawn.

She said: Honourable senators, as the sarne
motion has already been before the Senate
on one or two occasions, it is hardly necessary
for me to go into a detailed explanation of it.

It is being presented again at this time in
order that the committee, of which I am
chairman, may function this session. Adoption of the motion will give the committee
permission to hold meetings and carry out

its duties.

members know,

the

Senate has a small reporting staff. There
does not seem to be any point in reporting
the proceedings of a committee on matters
which may be dealt with in a bill that perhaps we shall have before us for consideration within a week or ten days.
I have met the minister and his deputy,
and I have complete confidence in them. I
know that they and their department are well
aware of the very difficulties which the committee would look into. It seems reasonable
to assume, therefore, that they will propose
statutory amendments designed to take care
of these difficulties.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: In reply to the honourable leader opposite, I may say that the committee to which he referred called upon me
for the purpose of having the somewhat substantial amendments to the Canadian Citizenship Act, which are now contemplated, introduced in the Senate, and it is the intention
of the government to have that done. Indeed,
I had hoped to be able to introduce the bill
today, but it is not available. As the act
has been in force for more than six years,
substantial revisions are necessary. I hope
to be able to introduce the bill the first of
next week, or very shortly thereafter.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Thank you.
The motion was agreed to.

reserve currency of almost all nations. The
question might well be asked, "Can the pound
be restored to its former prestige?" I am sure
it can be, for we have the resources to do it,
and the handicaps that are holding it back
are man-made and artificial. England, by
her system of trading and investing, made
sterling great in the old days right up to the
first World War, but the tremendous loss of
wealth which the United Kingdom suffered
during the two World Wars put the pound on
the rocks-and there it is, surrounded by
restrictions, whereas the only cure for its
present condition is freedom. For over sixty
years before the first World War England
was the dominant creditor country of the
world. London was the chief financial centre
and final clearing house for trade balances.
The system operated by the United Kingdom
worked smoothly, for it kept nations in balance. First, England not only stood for free
trade in commodities, but she also stood for
free trade in national currencies. In those
days England was willing to take annual
imports which were double the value of her
exports. Half her imports were in payment
for her exports, and the other half were in
payment of interest on loans for shipping,
banking and insurance services.
During that period the United Kingdom
had each year a surplus for foreign investment, which is estimated at a value of around
a half billion a year, and this totalled up to
around six billion pounds, or thirty billion
of dollars. In the meantime, of course, about
ten billions of these loans had been repudiated, which amount was really a gift to other
nations. This is how England closed the gap
in the early part of this century: by imports
and reinvesting her trade surplus. But the
two wars, as we know, weakened the United
Kingdorn financially to such a great extent
that the United States became the world
creditor nation and the dominant financial
power, and for some time now it has been
the responsibility of America to keep the
trade of the free world in balance, just as it
was England's responsibility to keep her trade
with the world in balance when she was the
dominant power.
It is as true as the sun rises that debtor
nations can only pay creditor nations with
the goods and services they produce; and if
such things as they produce are not received
by the creditor nations, there results a constant balance-of-payment crisis, with al the

imports has been the cause of the dollar gap.

has done a great deal to alleviate the situation by all the generous grants-military

and economic aid-which she has made to
Europe and other countries, it has been a
muic

system, and we go from one crisis to another
in trying to balance international accounts.
This is very unsettling to the economic stability and independence of other nations, and
consequently creates much tension and ill
will. Quite a portion of the dollars which
the United States tried to put into circulation
abroad during the last three years did not
find their way into the trade channels, and
this must be discouraging to our great neighbour. Several nations of the free world took
the American dollars and hoarded them as
reserves, and Canada seems to be at the top
of the list. About four billion U.S. dollars
have been taken out of circulation and put
into steel vaults by the following nations:
Canada, around one billion dollars; Japan,
500 millions; Germany, the Netherlands and
Indonesia, around 300 millions each; France,
Egypt and Cuba, 200 millions each, and other
nations smaller amounts. In the decline of
the value of the American dollar we have
I believe, lost over 100 million dollars of our
reserves, and so it goes.
Now it might be asked what America can
do about a trade balance between dollar
areas and sterling areas, that is, to bridge
the dollar gap and end these balance-of-payment crises. Well, we can render substantial
temporary aid toward making the pound convertible and thus pave the way for dollar
investments in the resources of the commonwealth. Investors are sensitive, and they are
not going to invest their dollars in commonwealth enterprises when they cannot get
back returns on their investment in their
own currency. This can only be brought
about by making the pound free and convertible. Also, a convertible pound would
mean the ultimate death knell of trade restrictions. After the pound is freed, we in
America should be prepared to invest our
trade surplus in the economic development
of other parts of the commonwealth, NATO
countries and the free world. Foreign trade
and investment are dominant factors which
determine the level of our living standards.
Look at the opportunity we have for investment, for instance, in our West Indies. Canada has no tropical province, and our people
are spending tens of millions in the southern
States every winter. If the West Indies had
enough facilities, such as hotels, playgrounds,
etc., a great many of these millions could be
diverted and spent there; also, many more
Americans would be attracted to these
islands, especially if the rackets were kept
out. We should strive for economic union
with the West Indies. They can be made

FEBRUARY 12, 1953
far larger customers than they are at
present. Canada should set an example by
including sterling in its national reserves.
The pound is convertible now in the sterling
area, i.e., the Malayas, South Africa, New
Zealand, Australia, the West Indies, etc., and
I believe the time is coming before long
when it will be convertible in the dollar
area. We must work to that end, for there
is no use fooling ourselves: the free world
must pull together or pull apart; we cannot
continue Tower-of-Babel style. Instead of
forty different kinds of languages, there are
forty different kinds of money.
Now I contend that future purchasing
power in the empire is a sound reserve; also,
investment in our commonwealth is no wild
speculation-such investments have proven
profitable indeed. If we believe in the future
of our sister nations of the empire and want

them as our close friends and neighbours
in the free world, we m'ust co-operate with
them in their development and trade problems in the same way as England did with
friendly nations during the last part of the
nineteenth century and the first part of this
century. We would be a long time losing $100
million in our investment in sterling or in
the sterling area. Furthermore, if we take
our surplus trade balance in sterling we can
use a part of it to buy up our obligations
on the London stock exchange. We still have
nearly $2 billion of our securities in Europe,
on which we are paying a service charge of
around a million dollars a week, so we can
repatriate a considerable portion with sterling and make a saving.
Again, we have lots of surplus food in this
country. Would it not be better to take
sterling for these surpluses which we can
invest, rather than let these surplus foods lie
around in warehouses at considerable overhead expense, or try to jam food down the
throats of our own people by the subsidy
method? Subsidies do us no good as a people,
for we simply subsidize one business to the
detriment of another-we do not increase the
consumption of food, and why should we?
Sterling does not deteriorate with time or
cost anything to carry, whereas food does.
We certainly do a good job in sending
munitions abroad. I notice a defence department report states that Canada has shipped
military stores, ammunition and other armaments worth $264 million to North Atlantic
Treaty Organization countries. I agree with
Dr. Keenleyside and the former Agriculture
Minister of Ontario, Mr. Kennedy, that we
are strong on munitions for poor nations and
weak on food. Empty bellies certainly appreciate food as much as guns; besides, we have
a surplus of food and would get sterling for
a good part of this surplus if we wanted to,

whereas we do not have a surplus of munitions, unless we manufacture them at the
taxpayers' expense. It is unquestionably a
good thing for security purposes that we are
in NATO, and we must pull our load; but
we are told the ratio of our aid is $100 for
munitions to $1 for food, etc.
Now it is just as bad not to harvest a crop
that is offered to us by nature in this country
as it is to plough a crop under. Poor economic
conditions in any country stimulate communism. The seeds of communism always
find fertile ground where there are hungry
people. One of the greatest things that the
wealthier nations can do to fight communism
is to help raise the standard of living of the
poorer nations. Take Italy, for instance. It
is one nation in Europe where communism
has been making some headway recently. I
noticed that the United Nations gave aid to
the children of Italy to the extent of $16
million; and while we have shipped to that
country $85 million worth of munitions, I
have no record of our having helped it out
with food.
Knowing what I do about world trade, I
cannot emphasize too strongly that first and
foremost we must work toward the establishment throughout the empire of a convertible
currency; and as stated, my opinion, after
deep study, is that North America should
give all-out co-operation to bring about the
re-establishment of the pou.nd sterling, for
it means more than we realize to the free
world.
For instance, across the border there are
forty-eight little nations trading amongst
themselves, doing a vast trade beyond one's
imagination. The total income of the United
States last year, as I recall it, was $325 billion; and there was practically no unemployment amongst their 63 million working
people. And that country gave away some
$7 billion or $8 billion to foreign aid.
Dealing with trade in the United States,
you would never hear of Texas or Hawaii
being unable to ship goods to Maine, some
thousands of miles away, because of bookkeeping or exchange difficulties. Or take the
Russian sphere of influence in trade-the
idea of the provinces on the Black Sea being
unable to ship goods to Moscow on account
of exchange difficulties is unheard of. Now
we can see what disadvantages there are in
the British Empire, when we have places to
which one can hardly ship goods across on a
ferry without running into exchange difficulties or the difficulties of nonconvertibility.
Surely we can solve this problem, for right
here in the empire we have the brawn and
the brains to solve it if we get together, put
our hand to the plough and do not look back.

SENATE
A great deal of thought is being given by
the nations belonging to NATO and other
democracies of the free world Lu trade,
exchange and other economic problems. A
considerable amount of spadework has been
done toward taking the shackles off trade
between the nations of the free world, but
so far the major portion of the talks and
negotiations bas been carried out by respective government departments which deal
with international commercial relations. But
these negotiations have now reached a higher
level, as is witnessed by the coming visit
from England to the United States next
month of the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
Richard Butler, and the Foreign Secretary,
Anthony Eden, to discuss trade and economic
relations of the sterling area with John
Foster Dulles, Secretary of State for the
United States, and George M. Humphrey,
Secretary of the Treasury.
Here in Canada we are greatly interested
in the expansion of our foreign trade, as of
course are other nations who belong to NATO,
as well as the rest of the free world. The
question is: how can greater freedom be
brought about? "Trade, not aid" is now a
headline of the press in many free world
countries. Constructive suggestions have been
made-to do such things as lower tariffs,
ease customs regulations, cut out import
quotas, free the pound sterling, raise the price
of gold, increase investments by the dollar
countries in productive industry in the commonwealth countries and NATO nations, etc.
These suggestions are being made as a means
to closing the dollar gap and placing the trade
of the free world on a stable and balanced
basis. In Canada a great interest is being
shown by various organizations and the press
in these trade problems. Boards of trade,
individuals and many business institutions
which are familiar with the North Atlantic
pact-especially article 2, which deals with
economic relations-want to be heard; and
it seems to me that a committee of this honourable body would be the best forum to
conduct hearings and receive representations.
I feel sure that having delegations of interested Canadians, and possibly representatives
from other parts of the commonwealth and
other NATO nations, come before a committee of this honourable body and express
their views with regard to the trade problems
of the free world, will prove of great benefit; and valuable information placed before us
will serve as a foundation for further constructive proceedings.
I trust that before
the committee completes its hearings it will
be able to make some valuable suggestions
or recommendations which will help us to find
ways and means for carrying out article 2 of

the North Atlantic pact; and suggestions also
toward a solution of the trade problems of
the wholc free world.
In connection with the North Atlantic pact
we must remember that the sections dealing
with mutual aid and economic collaboration
are as solemn and binding as the clauses that
deal with military aid, and they should be
implemented concurrently. We have gone
a long way with regard to military aid; and
now, it seems to me, the time is past due
when inquiry should be made as to how the
former clauses can be carried out. I believe
that a committee of this honourable house
can make a worthy contribution towards this
end.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable members, in
seconding the motion of the senator from
Southern New Brunswick (Hon. Mr. McLean),
I should like to compliment him both on his
resolution and on the informative nature of
his address. It is not my purpose, today at
least, to follow him in his profound exposition
and examination of the economic and
financial difficulties of the sterling area. To
speak frankly, perhaps one of my reasons
for this is that at the moment I do not feel
quite qualified to do so.
My friend made some reference to the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization. I think
it is true that many people have the impression that practically the only purpose of
NATO is to unite the North Atlantic countries for purposes of defence. There is a
great deal more to the treaty than that. My
remarks, which will be general in their
nature, will have to do almost entirely with
the obligations which Canada, as a member
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
has assumed.
In general, if no individual country can
successfully defend itself or effectively carry
on a war unless its internal economy, industrial and other, is sound, it is obvious that
international military co-operation, to be
efficient, must be supplemented by co-operative international trade relations.
This
resolution, as I understand it, is designed to
promote that object.
I have one other reason for supporting my
friend's motion. About two years ago the
Senate, with hardly a dissenting voice, passed
a resolution favouring the calling of a meeting of the Atlantic countries to explore the
possibilities of an Atlantic, or what is sometimes called a federal, union, presumably
a union somewhat similar to the federation
of the states of the United States or of the
provinces of Canada.
If that degree of
co-operation or collaboration in the fields of
defence and of international trade were

FEBRUARY 12, 1953
achieved, it would be a real forward step
towards the goal of Atlantic union and, in
my opinion, a powerful factor, in the maintenance of world peace.
I am very happy to second the motion.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I am a bit of a pessimist. However., let me
begin by congratulating the honourable member from Southern New Brunswick (Hon. Mr.
McLean) on his very able presentation of
this motion; I would add that I can readily
understand the ideas which, in this connection, occupy the mind of the honourable
member from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler). Day
by day one reads in the newspapers and
magazines, echoing the conclusions of the
conference which met in London last December, that all that is necessary to re-establish
world trade is to make sterling convertible.
But I have never heard anybody, including
my honourable friend who spoke this afternoon, tell us how sterling can be made convertible. My honourable friend said we
could promote trade by cutting down the
barriers, erected through customs regulations,
against business. Bitter complaint is made
that these restrictions bar the entrance of
our goods to the United States. Lying on the
Table at this moment is a protest by our
government to the United States government
against restrictions on the admission of our
dairy products. Regulations are imposed by
the American authorities, and away goes our
business. Presumably as a result of the
recent conference of commonwealth Prime
Ministers, the British Chancellor and the
President of the Board of Trade are reported
to be about to visit the United States. Incidentally, much of the proceedings of the
commonwealth conference do not seem to
have been divulged to the public. I think
there is too great a tendency to withhold
information for fear of letting Russia know
what we are doing. But the British ministers
can be visiting Washington with only one
object-to make the pound sterling convertible. What means to this end can they possibly suggest? Either one of two things. One
is, to lower United States tariffs on manufactured goods from the sterling area to
enable those countries successfully to compete for business. From all that I have
gathered from reports of interviews and
speeches by members of the Senate and the
House of Representatives, I do not believe
that that course will be adopted. The only
other means of correcting the present situation is for the United States to loan large
sums of money to nations which are short
of dollar currency.
Hon. Mr. Euler: They have been doing that.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes. But what they have
done is not enough. The French government
have stated that France cannot carry on unless she is granted additional subsidies of
seven or eight hundred million dollars.
Britain has announced that her full co-operation in international defence must be delayed,
although she has been promised between now
and the end of the year another $400 million in
addition to advances for military purposes.
How can the United States-or Canada, which
in this respect has much the same problem
as the Americans-meet this situation? We
are poorer. We have only got a national
production of about $2 billion.
Hon. Mr. Euler: $23 billion.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I meant to say $23 billion.
At any rate, it is one-fifteenth of what the
United States have. To some degree we are
in the same boat as they are. What brings
money into Canada today? Why are United
States interests investing hundreds of millions
of dollars in our country? They know that
our laws will protect their investments and
that they will be able to take out their
earned profits after income tax deductions.
What happened to the hundreds of millions
of pounds the British invested in Persia and
Iran? Look at what is going on in the Middle
East and in India. India is short of food,
particularly meat, yet cattle by the hundreds
are allowed to run unattended up and down
the country. The people in those countries
do not realize that if they want the Western
nations to invest money within their boundaries they will have to offer some protection
for the investments. How much money would
have been invested in Western Canada had
oil not been found in Alberta, and had the
Aberhart theories been carried out? Even at
that it was difficult at one time for the province to sell bonds, and they eventually fell
pretty low when dividends were not paid.
It is true that when oil was found in Alberta,
thanks to the old provincial Liberal government of 1896-and the same is true of the
government in Manitoba-the patent rights
on oil were held up and kept in the crown.
Because of this action these governments
came into the money.
Sterling areas cannot expect that foreign
investments will be made in them except
through force on the part of foreign governments. The ordinary person would not invest
his money. Would you? If I came forward
and said, "I want you to put a bond issue
on India to build an irrigation scheme,"
would you do it? You might if I offered you
100 per cent profit. Would you invest money
in Iran, Egypt, Ceylon, Malaya or Indonesia?
Not on your life. Where are the shipsworth about $12 million-that the Chinese

SENATE

took from us? The ships whistled "Toot,
toot" and away they went.
People preach that in order to get trade we
must make money convertible. Well, you
cannot make it convertible unless you are
willing to underwrite the whole show. What
happens when a banker lets his money out
on an industry and the industry starts to
go flat. As we were told in committee the
other day, a fellow walks into a bank manager and asks, "Are you in the boot and shoe
business?" and the banker says no. The
fellow says to him, "Well, you are now,"
and he hands over his business to the bank.
Well, when we make investments abroad we
take similar risks.
I am as good a Britisher as anybody, but
I want to make this statement. The theory
has been alive in Great Britain for the last
ten or twelve years that she can work forty
hours a week and live as though she had
the millions she had in former days. The
honourable senator from Southern New
Brunswick (Hon. Mr. McLean) told us that
for over sixty years prior to the first World
War half of England's imports were in payment for her exports. England has lost a
great deal of her insurance and financial
business and investments in other countries.
It is true that the British fought two world
wars and are deserving of our help. Nobody
realizes that better than I do. But the cold
fact of human nature is that people do not
give money under such conditions as I have
outlined. That is the truth of it.
Let me give the house an illustration. In
1951 the Woolworth Company in Britain made
a gross profit of £14 million, but after income
tax deductions it was able to show a profit
of only £6 million. In other words, Britain
took £8 million from the company. Canada's
income tax laws are bad enough, but Britain's
are a little worse. In 1952 the same company
showed a gross profit of £16 million, but it
paid £10 million income taxes. In fact, I
believe the actual net profit was only £5 14
million. So the net profit last year was
smaller, although the company's over-all
business amounted to £2 million more than
in the year before. Britain cannot expect to
attract foreign capital so long as that kind
of thing lasts.
What happened to the hundreds of thousands of pounds which British people invested
in Shanghai and other places? If I had
stood up and said, "You people are making a
mistake, because the government of China
is not stable and therefore you should not
invest your money there", I would have been
hooted at.
What has been the experience of Americans?
They are shrewd businessmen-they may not

be any more shrewd than we are-and they
are not going to invest in countries where
they wiii be taxed to dedLii or where they
will lose their money as a result of revolution.
And that is what investors face today in
many countries.
I may cause some trouble or start a dispute,
but I want to say one more thing. I should
like to know why the British people are so
bitter today at President Eisenhower because
he said that the United States were going to
cease shielding the Chinese mainland from
a Nationalist invasion from Formosa. Why
shouldn't the Americans take that course, if
they wish? Who is carrying the load today
in the Korean war? Nobody but the United
States. Whose boys are dying in Korea? The
great majority of United Nations casualties
are Americans.
Hon. Mr. Baird: Who carried the load in
1914?
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is something that bas
gone by. That is the trouble. We are dealing
with the present, not the past.
Hon. Mr. Baird: Yes, but we must not
forget.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The situation has changed.
I maintain that conversion of money will
never take place unless one or two things
happen. First of all, the people in the sterling
area must realize that they have got to give
security-not physical assets alone, but moral
security as well-to ensure investors that they
can take their earnings out. Unless this
security is forthcoming, money will not be
invested. The government can force it to
be invested, but only for so long. I may say
quite candidly that I do not believe the
people of the United States will force their
government to do such a thing. We may as
well recognize these facts and not prate here
to the effect that if we had some pounds
sterling everything would be rosy. That is
not truc. Why did our Trade Minister go to
South America to make trade deals? Sterling
did not come into consideration.
I am willing that this subject be referred to
committee, because I should like to ask
representatives of the chambers of commerce and other organizations to tell us how
we are going to solve this riddle. And I
should like to ask a question of any one here:
Would you, Mr. Senator, as the head of a
corporation, invest its money in India, Ceylon
or Pakistan today? I will bet my life that
your answer would be no.
Canada, I believe, is the one country that
can offer leadership to the countries of the
world, including the United States and Great
Britain. Though we are a small country, we

FEBRUARY 12, 1953
live very close to the United States, and we
understand their problems and can explain
them to the world.
I say all this with sadness in my heart,
realizing the terrible struggles that certain
countries are experiencing today. But at
times I become very tired of listening to
other countries trying to tell the United
States what it should and should not do.
Where in the world today can we find a more
experienced man than the President of the
United States-with the probable exception
of Mr. Churchill-and one who is more
anxious to rid the world of communism?
The honourable senator from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) has said we cannot win wars
with a military machine unless it is backed
up with good economic conditions at home.
That is very true. Stalin's greatest hope is
that our system will break down under
heavy expenditures for defence purposes.
The honourable senator from Southern
New Brunswick (Hon. Mr. McLean) said that
we have given Italy something like $80
million worth of war material, but nothing
for the people to eat. My bet is that the
Italian uttered louder cheers for the countries which gave them $5 million worth of
food, than for Canada which gave them $80
million worth of armaments.
It is not easy for a person to separate himself from his party, but what I have said
today may not be supported by every member of the party to which I have the honour
to belong. But so long as I remain in this
house I must not fail to express clearly the
views I hold. I say most emphatically that
we must find a solution for the serious world
trade problems facing us today.
I am willing to attend the proposed committee, and to help in its work in every way
I can, but I shall want the witnesses who
appear before it to tell me whether they
would invest their money in certain countries. If they would not do so, then their
evidence would not be worth a hoot.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
we have listened to some excellent speeches
today. The address of the honourable leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) was of his usual
forceful type and contained much of value.
I do not feel competent to discuss this vast
problem this afternoon, without some further reflection on it, and with the permission
of the house I move the adjournment of the
debate.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.

TRADE MARKS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Salter A. Hayden moved the second
reading of Bill R-3, an Act relating to trade
marks and unfair competition.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
proposes a new Trade Marks Act for Canada,
to replace the existing act, known as the
Unfair Competition Act, 1932. In order to
get some appreciation of the study, effort
and research involved in the preparation of
the bill now before us, I think I should
indicate briefly the nature and extent of the
work of the special committee which studied
the subject.
It should first be noted that this bill was
introduced during the past session, but was
not proceeded with at that time. After its
introduction a fairly wide and satisfactory
distribution of copies of it was made among
persons and organizations who might be
interested. As a result, submissions were
made, which, even since the introduction of
the bill last year, have brought about some
changes, though not substantial, in the
present bill.
I should like to point out the work done
by the committee that studied this question.
The committee was set up in 1947, under certain terms of reference, which included the
making of a preliminary study of the suggestions that had already been received in relation to a revision of the Unfair Competition
Act. The committee was asked to secure
further advice from organizations and
individuals who might appear to be interested
in this question. It was then asked to advise
and report upon what arrangements could
be made for the drafting of a new statute,
and to recommend methods to be followed in
the drafting, or if deemed advisable to prepare the proper draft statute for study.
In the course of carrying out those terms
of reference the committee sought the advice
of interested persons and organizations, not
only in Canada but elsewhere in the world,
particularly in the United States and the
United Kingdom. It prepared and sent out
a questionnaire based on the present lawthe Unfair Competition Act-which had been
the subject matter of court interpretation, and
and
on submissions which individuals

interested bodies had from time to time made
with a view to getting some revision of that
act.
No limitation was put upon the right of
those persons to whom the questionnaire was
sent, to submit any additional recommendations or comments which they wished to make
generally in relation to the present act, as
to changes which they thought might be
beneficial.
As well there was a shorter form of questionnaire prepared for general distribution
to the membership of the Canadian Manufacturers' Association. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce distributed copies of the
more comprehensive questionnaire among all
its member chambers and boards of trade
across Canada. The Association of Canadian
Advertisers in Toronto, I should point out,
distributed a very substantial number of
copies of this latter questionnaire.
This
questionnaire was also reprinted in full in
The Canadian Bar Review, and in Ontario
Weekly Notes, a publication issued by the
Law Society of Upper Canada which contains decisions of cases in the courts of
Ontario. Notice of the activities of the committee appeared in the Journal of the Patent
Office Society of the United States, and there
were references to its work and objects in the
daily press of Canada.
I emphasize these things to indicate that
this committee, which was set up in 1947,
proceeded by methodical and careful planning to sample public opinion, through various organizations that would be interested,
in Canada and other important parts of the
world.
And it is as a result of all this
that the present bill comes before us. I
suggest, therefore, we can assume that not
only has a great deal of thought and reflection gone into the preparation of the bill,
but that, where departures occur from the
provisions and the bases of trade mark law
in the present act, those changes have not
been made hurriedly nor without regard to
the many representations supporting them,
and full consideration of any representations
opposing such changes. Having made that
preliminary statement, I will now briefly
direct your attention to the registration
provisions. I am not going to read them; I
am not even going to summarize them. I
will merely refer you to them and, if you
read them, you will acquire familiarity with
the procedure. The registration sections of
the present bill are: section 2, paragraphs (f)
and (t); sections 12 to 14 inclusive, 16 to 18
inclusive, 31, and 36 to 39 inclusive. These
may be called the formal administrative and
procedural sections, prescribing the manner
in which to proceed to register a trade mark

FEBRUARY 12, 1953
and the various steps that must be taken, the
notices which must be given, and the rights
acquired at various stages along the way
until the trade mark is either granted or
refused.
One of the big problems for consideration
was the definition of "trade mark" itself. As
originally defined in the Unfair Competition
Act, 1932, and as interpreted. subsequently
by the courts, it was felt by those who dealt
with this situation as a matter of regular
business that it put them in a difficult position.
First I will read the definition in the
Unfair Competition Act:
2 (m) "Trade mark" means a symbol which has
become adapted to distinguish particular wares
falling within a general category from other wares
falling within the same category, ...

Having regard to that definition, the
Supreme Court has held that a symbol,
meaning a trade mark, a word mark or a
design mark, that is not adapted to distinguish
in the sense of being both distinctive in fact
and inherently adapted to distinguish, must
not only be refused registration, but cannot
even be regarded as a trade mark for any
purpose. That approach to the definition-.
and I agree that section 2 (m) certainly was
designed to bear such an interpretation-meant that, in so far as trade marks have
become trade marks in fact, by use to such
an extent that whereas in the first instance
the word may have been a common word, by
its continued use in relation to particular
goods of a particular person, it has acquired
a secondary meaning, under the Unfair Competition Act, having regard to the definition
I read and the interpretation placed on it
by the courts, it was not possible to apply
and obtain registration under the registration
provisions of the present act. There was
in the act a procedure under which one could
go to the Exchequer Court and have a hearing-possibly a long hearing-in order to
support the claim that this particular word
had been so used that it had acquired this
secondary meaning, and therefore was a trade
mark in fact; but notwithstanding, there was
the definition, and the decision by the courts
that a trade mark which qualifies as a trade
mark in fact, having acquired a secondary
meaning, is not a trade mark for any purpose. That is one of the problems the committee had to consider.
Further, under the present trade mark law
it was not possible to assign a trade mark
without passing the good will that went with
the wares with which the trade mark was
associated; and there was no provision for
the licensing of the use of the trade mark.
In other words, its use was confined to the
holder of the trade mark in relation to the
goods and wares of such holder.

In all these various respects the committee, after full study of the pertinent law
in other countries, particularly the United
Kingdom and the United States, felt that our
concept of trade mark law in practice should
be made more up to date, or shall we say
streamlined, so that the objects which I have
mentioned would be permissible in terms
provided by statute. Having regard to all
these ends which they sought to accomplish,
it became necessary to re-write the definition
of a trade mark; and while, upon reading it
as it now stands, it seems very simple indeed,
in fact it took some considerable time before
the committee could finally resolve the viewpoints of the various interests concerned. By
section 2, paragraph (t), of the bill,"trade mark" means
(i) a mark that is used by a person for the
purpose of distinguishing or so as to distinguish
wares or services manufactured, sold, leased, hired
or performed by him from those manufactured,
sold, leased, hired or performed by others,

As I have said, the wording is simple, and
I think the definition is easy to understand.
Then, "trade mark" means(ii) a certification mark,
(iii) a distinguishing guise, or
(iv) a proposed trade mark;

In this way the definition is broadened, and
covers the purpose for which a trade mark is
intended; that is, it is a mark used by a
person for the purpose of distinguishing
wares, services, etc., of his from those of
others.

Of course, once you embark on a change
of definition, other things must follow.
I had intended, if this bill had been reached
at an earlier date, to deal at some length
with its provisions. Time has somewhat
mellowed the urge within me to give an
exhaustive exposition of trade mark law. The
way I originally put it was that I really had
not the time to be brief, and therefore if
you had been exposed to an explanation of
this bill on Tuesday evening it might have
been a reasonably lengthy one, and somewhat involved as well. I do not think I
would have preached any heresy, but I may
have taken a far greater length of time to
explain the bill than I propose to take today.
Since then my urge has dimmed a little, and
I now feel I should tell this body simply the
bare essentials of the bill, where the changes
have occurred, and leave it to the committee
members in their study of the sections to
ferret out all the reasons for these changes.
My explanation may not completely satisfy
a trade mark attorney, but I am not speaking
to trade mark lawyers. I am simply attempting an explanation that will give honourable

continue to manufacture, and the benefit of
the trade mark may be passed on to another
person who is doing the marketing operation.
I do not know whether that answers my
honourable friend's question or not.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It seems very, very
involved. At the present time there may
be a trade mark applying to goods which
you manufacture or which you sell-.that is,
you may have it as the manufacturer or as a
vendor.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: And at the present
moment you cannot separate those two functions, so as to allow the trade mark used by
No. 1, in the manufacturing operation, to be
used at the same time by No. 2, in the sale
of the goods. Do I understand that the new
bill corrects that situation, and allows both
persons to use the trade mark in different
capacities?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Or in different localities?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Then I take it the old
principle that a trade mark must be annexed
to goods and cannot be separated from themor, to use the old legal phrase, "cannot be
assigned in gross"-still stands, notwithstanding this bill?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Subject to this limitation
that, should the present bill become law, if
I enjoy a trade mark I may be able to pass
the benefit of that trade mark on to some
person who is going to market the goods,
while I continue to do the manufacturing.
In other words, I do not have to pass on
the goodwill of the business in the manufacture of the articles, in order to retain a valid
trade mark. Under the bill there can be only
one owner at a time, but the trade mark
can follow the goods. For instance, I may
manufacture the goods while the sale of
them is in the hands of some other personit could be a subsidiary company or an
independent agent.
In my attempt to answer the questions of
honourable senators as they have been asked,
I have disturbed the order in which I had
intended to present the various provisions of
the bill. As I return to the subject matter,
I will try not to retrace my steps. I shall
now enumerate the respects in which the bill
differs from the present law.
Under the present law we may have a
word mark and a design mark. As a result,
a serious situation has developed. I, for
instance, may have a trade mark in relation
to my wares which might inherently lie in

the totality of the word and design. That is
to say, a trade mark may have been not in
the word or words used, or in the design,
but in the totality of the combination of the
two; therein may lie my trade mark. Under
the present law I would have to make some
kind of division, and register my trade mark
in respect of the word mark and in respect
of the design mark.
The bill now before us would do away with
that, shall I say, artificial division which
exists in dividing the combination of words
and design which form one trade mark. If
the bill becomes law, one will be required to
register only the words and design, provided
of course it qualifies as a trade mark in respect of the thing which it is used to distinguish.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The word mark will
have gone?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The word mark as such
will have gone, yes. It is now to be a trade
mark-it may be words, or it may be designs, or it may rest in the totality of both
words and designs.
I should call the attention of the house to
the fact that under the new bill, trade mark
is extended to include services. I would
refer again to paragraph (t) of section 2,
which provides for the inclusion of services.
It is on the basis that a person who performs services should be able to label them
by some individual mark which distinguishes
them. The word "services" has been added
to "wares" in defining trade marks.
Hon. Mr. Baird: Would that include such a
mark as "Blue Cross"?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: My honourable friend
has raised a question with which I intended
to deal in a few moments. Would he allow
me to defer my answer until I come to it?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Are we going to have
trade marks for haircuts?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I have always thought
we had, though I do not know how one
would register such a trade mark. I do not
know whether anyone possesses such ingenuity as to be able to describe by words a
distinctive haircut.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: What then is included
in "services"? I do not quite grasp it.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Would it include hospital services?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I shall come to that in
a moment.
In the present-day commercial life many
people are engaged in rendering services not
only in respect of goods, but over wider

SENATE

areas in the form of business enterprises,
auite unrelated to the manufacture or distribution of wares. An example that readily
comes to my mind in the first class is that
relating to dry cleaning of garments, preshrinking and processing textiles and that
sort of thing; and, in the second class, various
forms of entertainment, such as radio,
orchestra, television and stage performances.
The committee in its report said those who
desired to do so should be able to employ a
trade mark to distinguish services provided
by them from similar services provided by
other people, and to be in a position to
protect their trade mark rights.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: On what would they
put their trade mark?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: They could put it on the
program, if they are performers, or on the
billing; in advertising, they could use their
mark as a symbol of distinctiveness. In that
way when one sees a mark of a certain
performer, one might say "They are back
here again". And whether they were good or
bad would be the factor deciding whether
one would go to see them.
I should also point out that the word
"wares" has been expanded to include printed
publications. Heretofore one could not register
the title of a newspaper-though it depends
on what the title is. Under the bill, the
expanded definition of wares includes printed
publications, as to which one may register
a trade mark.
I come now to the question asked by the
honourable senator from St. John's (Hon. Mr.
Baird) regarding the use of "Blue Cross".
The present act sets out a number of clauses
which indicate prohibited marks-marks to
which no one can claim the use of a trade
mark. Prominent among those would be the
name of the Royal Family, the Red Cross and
other names of that kind. Sections 9 and 10
of the bill enumerate the prohibitions under
the present law and enlarge upon them. One
has only to look at section 9 to see that it
parallels the list in the present law, and also
enlarges upon it. For instance, you will see
in paragraph (m) of section 9 (1) that the use
of the words "United Nations" is prohibited.
That is something added, and that would be
in the class of prohibited trade marks.
My honourable friend has raised a question
as to "Blue Cross". It may be that section
10 of the bill would prohibit use of the
term "Blue Cross" in connection with services
which have become identified with the use
of those words. The provision is as follows:
Where any mark has by ordinary and bona fide
commercial

usage

become

recognized

in

Canada

as designating the kind, quality, quantity, destination, value, place of origin or date of production
of any wares or services, no person shall adopt it

as a trade mark in association with such wares or
services or others of the same general class or
use it in a way likely to mislead, nor shall any
person so adopt or so use any mark bu ±ieaïy
resembling such mark as to be likely to be mistaken therefor.

It may very well be-but that is a matter,
I take it, in the first instance for decision by
those who look after the interests of the Blue
Cross organization-that this organization
will not have sufficient protection under the
new section, and that there should be some
more specific reference.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: I would like to ask a
question about that. I have received a telegram from Dr. J. A. McMillan, of Charlottetown, president of the Board of the Maritime
Hospitals Service Association. There are in
Canada five Blue Cross organizations; one
each in Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec
and the Maritime Provinces, and Newfoundland; and they operate under the trade mark.
The telegram states that they have "permission from the American Hospital Association
to use the Blue Cross symbol and insignia so
long as required high standards for approval
are met". I wonder whether the new enactment would interfere with the set-up of the
Blue Cross in Canada?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: My honourable friend
has received a telegram, and I suppose other
senators who have spoken to me have had
communications on this matter. In my capacity as chairman of the committee which
may possibly consider this bill I also have
had communications from officers of the Blue
Cross; and the simple answer I have given
them is that the committee, when it convenes
to consider the bill will be only too anxious
to hear representations by persons who have
a real interest to put forward and feel they
have something of merit which should be protected. As I have pointed out, it is for them
to decide whether section 10 will afford them
adequate protection. If it does not, it wiIl
be up to the committee, after having heard
the departmental officers, to decide whether
there should be some more specific protection.
As regards what can be registered as a
trade mark, section 26 of the Unfair Competition Act provides thata word mark shall be registrable if it
(a) does not contain more than thirty letters
and/or numerals divided into not more than four
groups.

As a result of the questionnaires that were
sent out, and after full consideration, the
committee felt that a trade mark should not
be more or less of a trade mark, and as such
entitled to registration, because it had less

FEBRUARY 12, 1953
or more than thirty letters. It is true that
brevity may be a sign of virtue in trade
mark advertising-as no doubt it may be in
explaining trade mark bills-but there is no
reason for an arbitrary limitation on the number of letters that should be permitted; and
therefore, in section 12 of the bill, dealing
with registrable trade marks, certain changes
have been made. For instance, the reference,
to which I have just alluded, in section 26
of the act, to the length of word marks, has
been deleted.
Under the present law the name of a person, firm or corporation is not a subjectmatter of registration as a trade mark. That
limitation was thought to be improper; that
there might be, and undoubtedly are, cases
where the name of the firm has become so
identified with the ware that it has acquired
a meaning which is registrable as a trade
mark. It might be a symbol distinguishing the
goods from any other goods. So that limitation has been discarded.
Some change has been made in relation to
personal names and surnames, which, under
certain circumstances, upon compliance with
certain conditions, may be registered. Ail
these changes will be found in section 12 of
the bill, which combines sections 26 and 27
of the existing trade mark law.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Section 9 of the act,
regarding the registration of names, provides
that a man may register his own name so
long as he does not use it for purposes of
deception. Has that provision been retained?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Whether it is carried
over precisely into the new bill I cannot say,
because I have not made an examination of
it from that point of view. Under the present
law there are very special limitations on the
registration of personal names and surnames
and the distinctive use of such in relation to
any particular wares. By section 12 of the
present bill these restrictions have been
modified.
There are also provisions with respect to
registration of what are called prima facie
unregistrable trade marks. These relate to
cases where the words in the first instance
may have been common words, which could
not be said to have any distinctive meaning
in relation to particular wares, but continued
use has given them a secondary meaning.
And there is now a provision under which
these symbols, which prima facie would be
unregistrable because they do not satisfy the
test of the trade mark definition, may be
registered if it can be demonstrated that they
have acquired this secondary meaning, and
if the appropriate provisions for registration
are included.

Also, in the present bill provisions will be
found regarding the amount of protection
to be accorded to trade marks. I do not
know whether I can make this matter clear
in a few words; but up to the present time
the concept of trade mark protection has
been that, if I register a trade mark in relation to certain wares, like "Kodak" in relation to cameras, and if some person picks up
that word and uses it in relation to some
unrelated product, the law, if strictly applied,
would not prevent the use of the word in
relation to this unrelated product.
The law has moved ahead in other countries, the idea being that trade mark protection should be broader than it is. It is felt
that it should not be confined to a narrow
range. At present if I have a trade mark
"Kodak" on cameras, nobody else can use
it on cameras. But there could be confusion
with respect to the use of certain well-known
trade marks in a limited field through their
use on other and unrelated products. The
public might think that a trade mark is
so well known that it is a guarantee of the

source. Therefore, the proposal is to broaden
the extent of protection so that, even though
a trade mark may have application to certain
wares and services, if it is continued for a
certain length of time, its holder may in certain circumstances prevent its use when it can
be shown that it is leading to a confusion
as to the source of the goods; and in these
circumstances the owners of the trade mark
could prevent its use on unrelated lines.
Another provision in the bill deals with
what is called "opposition proceedings" at
the stage when an application is made to
register. This is new.
There are also provisions in relation to
transferring and assigning trade mark rights,
and also for controlling the licensing of trade
marks.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Would it be necessary
to give public notice in some way of an application for a trade mark?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes; and that is why
I made reference to these sections in the
bill. They provide for notices and for hearings where opposition can be asserted. The
opposition has a chance, therefore, to present
its case and be heard. Under the present
procedure, if I desire to get a trade mark I
make application and fill in the necessary
forms that are provided by the trade marks
office. They examine the application and
check their register to ascertain whether
anything has already been registered which
in their opinion, might result in some confusion. But under the present law there
is no notice to the public nor an opportunity
for opposition in that sense. Usually the way

SENATE
opposition has to be asserted is by taking
proceedings to have a trade mark invalidated
if you do not think it has ven properiy
granted.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Has the period been
changed?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No. I should point out
that under the present law there has been
no provision for the removal of trade marks
from the register unless an order for expungement is obtained from the court. There are
provisions in this bill for the removal of
unused trade marks from the register under
certain circumstances.
Hon. Mr. Reid: How long does a trade mark
last?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Fifteen years.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: But it may be renewed.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes, it may be renewed.
I think the honourable senator from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) refers to the
original period of the trade mark?
Hon. Mr. Reid. Yes.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Can a trade mark be
transferred for value received?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes. There are transferring and licensing provisions, and I assume
that if a person holding a trade mark makes
an agreement for transfer he will make it for
a consideration.
Honourable senators, I have very hastily
and sketchily given an outline of the subjectmatter of this bill but it has taken more time
than I thought. As the Senate will be examining the bill in detail in committee, I .did
not want to indulge in a lecture on trade mark
law at this time. The chairman of the committee which studied this bill, and departmental officials, will be available in committee
to answer the questions of honourable senators. A searching inquiry of this legislation
can be made at that time. The changes which
are proposed by the bill seem to rest on a
solid foundation, because they represent an
assimilation of the views expressed to the
members of the committee which studied this
matter in great detail. If the bill passes, our
trade mark law will be brought more into
line, not only in its scope and effect, but in
its terminology and procedure, with the trade
mark law of other important countries of the
world. It makes it easier for people operating in the international field of trade marks
when some uniformity in procedure and
terminology has been achieved.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I have two questions of a
general nature that I should like to ask the

honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden). How many countries are parties
to

thc

conve.t.<?

Is

there

anything

in

the

act allowing a country not a party to the
convention to register a trade mark in Canada
and yet not give the same protection to trade
marks in that non-convention country?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: My friend has asked me
a question dealing with a branch which I
cannot profess to say I know very much
about. I think he has in mind the effect of
the convention in relation to trade marks. I
cannot answer him, beyond saying that the
purpose of the convention is to bind the signatory countries to provide certain interchange or reciprocal accommodations in their
trade mark law. A country which is not a
party to that convention would be in the
same position as any individual in that
country. In other words, we say: "Here are
the provisions of our trade mark law with
respect to registration, and this is what you
must do in order to qualify for a trade mark
in Canada". As I understand the law, we
cannot say to one country that because it is a
signatory to the convention it is entitled to
take advantage of certain privileges contained
in the act which another country that is not
a signatory to the convention is not entitled
to. While the signatory countries to the convention have agreed to do certain things
among themselves, the moment the legislation
before us is put on the statute books it
becomes the law of the land and is available
to anyone.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
the question is on the motionHon. Mr. Roebuck: Just before the question
is put, I should like to compliment the gentleman who has explained this bill, even though
compliments are paid to him so frequently.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Before the question is
put, I should like to add that this proposed
legislation is indicative of a process that has
been going on for a long time in countries
where trade marks and the law of trade
marks have gradually developed. The law
of patents has been going on in the opposite
direction, and is much less important today
than it was fifty or a hundred years ago. At
that time a man with bright ideas could
always get a patent, and frequently could sell
or develop it. Today, industry has grown to
the point where a mere individual no longer
counts. Take, for instance, the automobiles.
I can remember the time when everyone was
his own motor mechanic and worked on his
car. But the car of today is far beyond the

FEBRUARY 12, 1953
attention of an individual. Any improvement that one might make has already been
made and is not patentable.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The less one knows about
a car the better.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Probably my friend is
right.
Such inventions as the airplane are far
beyond the scope of the individual. Patent
law with regard to aircraft applies now only
to great companies. Or, for instance, take
the newest of developments, atomic energy:
as to that, the individual is completely out
of the picture. Patent law still applies there,
but is usable only by the experts employed
by big business. Patent law today is, therefore, much less interesting to the general
public than it once was.
On the other hand, a counter-growth has
taken place with regard to trade marks. One
of the early examples of trade marks was the
stamp which the cutler placed on the steel
wares of England. The sword maker, for
instance, was required to put his mark on
his product; that mark was not for the purpose of securing his trade in swords, but to
indicate to the public his responsibility in
standing behind his goods. The public has
always had a certain interest in trade marks
in that regard; and while courts have never
adjudicated on the rights of the public, they
nevertheless have had in the back of their
minds the fact that a trade mark is an indication to a member of the consuming public
that the maker or vendor of the goods has
a responsibility with regard to them.
The matter of property rights in the manufacturer or vendor developed only gradually;
but with the expansion of trade and its
attendant complications, and with the modern
methods of merchandising and advertising,
the importance of the trade mark as distinguishing or identifying a product of either
a manufacturer or a vendor has become
more and more important.
Advertising today is scarcely to be mentioned in the same breath with advertising a
hundred years ago. And with the growth of
advertising, the importance of trade marks
has also grown.
This bill, I observe, sweeps away to a
considerable extent many of the restrictions
of the past. The ability to assign trade marks
is a good thing, because it is in keeping with
modern times and meets present-day complications. The whole act, and all the common
law now in force with regard to trade marks,
will be markedly modified by this bill.
Under its provisions one will not be able to
assign a trade mark unless, as the sponsor of
the bill has said, one assigns at the same

time the goodwill of the business producing
the goods so marked.
The provisions of the present act in this
respect have been very restrictive and difficult to comply with, particularly as they
affect subsidiary companies in Canada, whose
parent companies are in the United States.
Further, untold complications have arisen as
the result of the separation between the
ownership of the business and the ownership
of the trade mark. That, I believe, is being
taken care of by the bill.
The provisions of this measure indicate
considerable improvement and are most welcome. I compliment the committee who had
to do with the preparation of the bill and
its final drafting for presentation to us. I
did not study the measure carefully prior to
hearing the explanation today, relying on the
honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden) to give his usual lucid explanation
of a complicated piece of legislation. Perhaps
it is not a good thing to rely on another to
do the necessary studying of a measure such
as this.
I shall welcome an opportunity to learn
more about this measure when it reaches the
committee. Again I say its passage will render
a great service to the public.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Cairine R. Wilson moved the second
reading of Bill Y-3, an Act respecting a certain patent and patent application of Florence
F. Loudon.
She said: Honourable senators, the honourable member from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) has just said that patents are not
as important as they once were. However, I
think in this case the patent is at least very
important to the inventor. As a woman, I
may be presumed to know more than I do
about the device which is the subject-matter
of this bill. Perhaps, therefore, the house
will permit me to read the petition on which
the bill is based.
The petition of the undersigned, Florence F.
Loudon, a citizen of Canada, residing at 34 Rosemount avenue, in the city of Toronto, province of
Ontario, Dominion of Canada, humbly sheweth:
That on the 31st day of May, 1945, your petitioner filed an application in the patent office under
serial number 527,454 for a patent in respect of her
invention entitled "Means for Supporting Curtains
and Drapes".

SENATE
That, through no fault of your petitioner, the
::id application was considered by the patent office
to have becrmp completelv abandoned through
failure to prosecute the same in due time after
action taken thereon by an examiner on the 8th
day of July, 1947.
That your petitioner was informed of the above
mentioned fact in November, 1949, and was advised
that the only course open to her was to file a new
application in place of the said application serial
number 527,454.
That at the time of such advice the subject of
possible previous public use of the said invention
in Canada was not raised with your petitioner,
and she was unaware that it had any significance
in relation to the filing of such a new application.
That such new application was filed on the 27th
day of February, 1950, and patent number 474,716
was granted thereon on the 26th day of June, 1951.
That the said invention was in public use in
Canada in the year 1946, with the result that the
said patent number 474,716 is not valid having
regard to the provisions of the Patent Act, 1935."

APPENDIX A

DEPARTMENT 0F EXTERNAL AFFAIRS
FEBRUARY 11, 1953

Text of note presented by the Canadian Embassy ini Washington to the State Department
concerning the continuation and extension of United States restrictions on the import of
dairy produets.
The Canadian Ambassador presents his
compliments ta the Secretary of State and
has the honour to refer ta the Canadian
embassy's notes of August 27, 1951, and of
January 17, 1952, regarding the restrictions
imposed upon imports; of fats, oils and dairy
products under section 104 of the defence
production act of 1951.
The Secretary of State wili be aware that
these import restrictions were considered at
the sixth and seventh sessions of the contracting parties to the general agreement on
tariffs and trade and that resolutions were
adopted recognizing these measures to be
contrary to the provisions of the agreement.
On the occasion of the announcement on
December 30, 1952, of further import restrictions, relating to dried milk products, the
Canadian government re-examined the situation resulting from these restrictions. On
the basis of this review the Canadian government would again express its serious concern
at this infringement o! international agreements ta which the governments of the
United States and of Canada are parties.
The Government of Canada wishes ta cali the
attention of the Governmnent of the United
States ta the effects of these measures not
only on trade between the United States and
Canada but also on the broad commercial
policy interests o! the two governiments.

68112-17

The Government of Canada considers that
such departures fromn accepted principles of
commercial policy by the leading trading
nation can hardly fail ta weaken the force
of those principles and ta damage seriously
the development of world trade on a constructive basis.
Both Canada and the United States, recognizing the weakening effect of continued
reliance on import restrictions on economies
o! friendly countries, have frequently encouraged them. ta seek solutions ta their balance
of payment difficulties through increasing
exports rather than curtailing imports.
Actions by the United States government such
as that represented by these import restrictions tend ta undermine the confidence o!
overseas deficit countries in their ability ta
approach a balance by increasing their dollar
earnings. These measures may in consequence
have the effect of discouraging attempts
which rnight be made by such countries, in
the face of great difficulties, ta change the
general direction of national policies away
fram reliance on discriminatory import;
restrictions as methods o! achieving international balance.
The Government of Canada, accordingly,
takes this opportunity ta urge once more
that the import restrictions imposed under
section 104 o! the Defence Production Act of
1951 be rernoved as soon as possible.

CITIZENSHIP BILL

FIRST READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson presented Bill Q-5, an

Act to amend the Canadian Citizenship Act.
The bill was read the first time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall the bill be read the second
time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Wednesday next.
CANADIAN VESSEL CONSTRUCTION
ASSISTANCE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. John J. Kinley

moved the second

reading of Bill 19, an Act to amend the
Canadian Vessel Construction Assistance Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill, which comes to us from the
Commons, is to amend the Canadian Vessel
Construction Assistance Act, of 1949. In that
act are various provisions for assisting in
the building and operation of ships; and by
this bill it is sought to amend only one section, namely section 7. Before I deal with the
amendment it may be well for me to say what
that section contains.
By section 7 of the act ship owners are permitted each year to transfer to reserve
accounts a limited amount of tax-free money.
The purpose of the section is to enable an
owner to accumulate sufficient funds to meet
certain extraordinary expenses which he has
to incur periodically in connection with the
special surveys or inspections of his ships.
A special survey must be made either every
four or every five years, depending upon
whether the survey is for purposes of insurance under the rules of a classification
society or for purposes of safety under the
Canada Shipping Act.
It has been considered necessary to amend
the section in order to guard against a loss
of revenue through leaving tax-free reserves
in the hands of ship owners for indefinite
periods of time. Accordingly, the present
amendment provides machinery for periodically recapturing or rendering taxable such
of these reserves as are not or cannot be used
for the purpose for which they were intended;
as, for instance, in cases where the amounts

set aside exceeded the cost of survey, or where
a ship is lost or sold at some time during
one of these four or five-year cycles. Tli
amendment now before the house requires
all reserves to be brought into profit and loss
account in the year in which the survey was
completed or in which the ship was lost or
sold.
It should be observed that under the amendperiodically
ment the reserve account
becomes self-liquidating. If, on the other hand,
the ship is lost or sold, the reserves must
thereupon be brought into profit and loss
account; if, on the other hand, nothing
happens to the ship and the survey is held
in due course, the reserve is brought into
profit and loss account in the form of a
credit and the costs of the survey are
entered in the same account by way of offsetting debit.
The principle of the bill is clear; it seems
to me that it is fair; and I think we all
agree with it. This is really a committee
bill, being one of detail, and it was discussed
almost entirely in Committee of the Whole
in the other house. The purpose of the bill
is to amend section 7 of the Act, which
enables shipowners to make deductions for
income tax purposes under certain circumstances.
Although the principle is clear as to the
recapture of income tax on unused reserves,
the method of recapture might be questioned.
The amendment requires all reserves to be
brought into profit and loss accounts in the
year in which the survey is completed or in
which the ship is lost or sold. These reserves
are built up by setting aside each year an
amount to be used at the end of a four-year
period in order to have the ship refitted or
repaired. If the money is not used then, it
is taxed as income in one year. It can be
seen that to an individual this might be
harmful, but it does not make any difference
to a company because a company pays a tax
of 20 per cent on income up to $10,000, and
a tax running to a maximum of 45 per cent
If a ship
on income over that amount.
owner, an individual, has a reserve of this
kind and it is all charged for income tax in
the one year, this places him in a higher
bracket, and it was contended by some members of another place that this is unfair.
Unfortunately, I shall be away when the
Senate committee deals with this bill, but
I think that this is a point that the committee could take into consideration.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
as one who comes from the Prairie provinces,
where there are no ships, I have found it
difficult to follow the remarks of the honourable gentleman who has just explained the

FEBRUARY 16, 1953
bill <Hon. Mr. Kinley). He cornes frorn a
shipping province and is familiar with the
language of the Shipping Act; I ar n ot. I
may say that an honourable gentleman who
represents Vancouver in the other house told
me that he himself could not understand the
language of the bill. I sometimes think that
I arn a pretty good lawyer, but I do not say
s0 around this building, for I may be wrong.
Anyway, I could not understand the bill, so
I took the trouble of asking Mr. MacNeill,
the Law Clerk of the Senate, to put its
purpose into plain English for me.
As I understand it, a ship owner is allowed
to set aside a certain arnount as a reserve
for expenses incurred by reason of quadrennial or other special surveys in the years
between those surveys. Let us say that a
ship owner writes off $10,000 in each of the
years 1949, 1950 and 1951. Then in 1952 a
survey is made. Incidentally, I thought a
ship survey would be similar to a land survey, and that one would go and look at a
ship, see what damage has been done to it,
and so on. But Mr. MacNeill tells me it
means this: a ship must go into dry dock
and be hoisted up; a complete inspection
must take place, and necessary repairs have
to be made; ail the substance which attaches
itself to the bottorn of a ship must be cleaned
off and the bottom repainted.
Han. Mr. McKeen: That is done every year.
Hon. Mr. Haig: In the survey under the
Shipping Act the engines, as well as the
other parts of the ship, such as ber furnishings and tackle, are inspected. Over the fouryear period the ship owner has been allowed
to set aside $10,000 per year as a reserve
for this contingency. In the fourth year a
survey is made at a cost of perhaps $30,000;
and in that year the amounts held ini reserve
must.be brought back into his accounts and
shown as incorne. The purpose of the bull is
to include the reserve so set asîdie in ýcomputing the taxpayer's incorne for the taxation
year in which the survey is cornpleted or in
which the vessel is sold, lost or destroyed, or
where the circurnstances are such that the
survey will not likely be -completed.:
It had previously been suggested to me
that I should oppose this bill, but the information I received from Mr. MacNeill satisfied
me that the measýure was a reasonable one
and should be passed. I have made this
explanation in order that honourable senators
rnay better understand the purpose of the bill.
Han. Mr. NcKeen: Honourable senators, I
do not think my honourable friend the
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) will
mind if I correct an erroneous impression
which I think he lef t wîth the house. The
68112-17J

fact is that ships cannot be run for four
years without being taken into dry dock and
painted.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I know that.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: These overhauls are
done regularly every year. The four-year
survey that my honourable friend has been
talking about is for the purpose of bringing
the ship up to class in Lloyd's, or to some
other standard.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think I understand what
has to be done every four years.
The motion was agreed to, and the bil
was read the second time.

INTERNATIONAL TRADE
MOTION-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, February 12, the adjourned debate on the motion
of Hon. Mr. McLean that the Standing Committee on Canadian Trade Relations be
empowered to inquire into and report upon
the development of trade between countries
signatory to the North Atlantic Treaty, and
with other countries of the free world.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
with the unanimous consent of the house I
should like to suggest a change in the order
of the speakers in this debate.
The order for resumption of the debate
stands in my name. However, our colleagues
from St. John's West (Hon. Mr. Pratt) and
Queens-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley), find
it impossible to be in the chamber during
the next several days, and would like to
participate in the debate tonight. Therefore,
with the consent of the house, I shall make
way for them, and after they have spoken
I should like to adjourn the debate until
tomorrow afternoon.
Some Hon. Senators: Agreed!
Hon. Calvert C. Pratt: Honourable senators,
I am indebted to the honourable senator for
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) for the courtesy
of giving me this opportunity of speaking
this evening to the resolution relating to
international trade.
I feel it is well worth while at this time
to have our attention directed towards the
difficult problem of world trade, which
vitally affects not only our own people but
the people of every part of the world. The
more thought that is given to it, not only ii
the parliaments of the nations but in groups
of whatever nature, and by individuals, the
nearer do we get to an understanding of the
difficulties and a discovery of helpful
remedies.
One could not but be impressed with the
earnestness that the mover of the resolution
(Hon. Mr. McLean) displayed in his speech.
And if the Senate's study of the problem
fails to lead to a solution of all the difficulties, it may at least bring the public of
Canada closer to the issues that are involved.
It must be borne in mind that the complexities of the problem are such as to call
for expert handling and continuous negotiations. To understand the whole problem
is beyond the comprehension of most people.
Even financial and foreign relations wizards-

if there are such beings-must necessarily fall
hort of knowing all that is involved.
I, myself, am very conscious of my
inadequacy to deal fully with the question;
and indeed I think most people have a similar
feeling of inadequacy in this field.
Woven into the fibre of the question of
international trade relations are not only the
difficulties arising from scores of different
currencies, but there are also varying degrees
of national feeling, ambitions and diversity of
local interests. Many currencies have values
which are unstable even in the countries of
their origin, and still more unstable in their
relation to foreign money. Tied in also with
the freedom of exchanges and their relative
values is the trading position of each and
every country; and national policies have
to be taken into account. These policies are
influenced by import restrictions and tariffs
for the protection of home industries, and
of living standards, and by many other
considerations vital to each community.
Tariffs and restrictions of one kind and
another in world trading are predominant
factors in influencing the fluctuating valua
of money: in fact, such fluctuations are tied
in with human nature itself.
The world-or, I should say, the free world,
as we term it, is struggling unsteadily towards
a common objective of freer trade. Every
country wants it, but the cost and degree of
sacrifice needed to attain it varies with each
one.
The honourable member who introduced
the motion referred to the time of England's
greatness as the free trading nation of the
world, when her currency was the standard
of exchange. Her decline from those great
days was not brought on voluntarily. Partly,
indeed very materially, it is attributable to
the cost of two world wars. But in any event
she would have had to face up to worldwide threats implicit in rising national tariffs

a world atmosphere she was forced to abandon the great example of free-trading and
liberal outlook. It is in this changed world
we live today, and improvement will not be
brought about by wishful thinking, but only
by a step-by-step reconciliation of interests.
This step-by-step effort is now being made,
and I am glad that Canada, so far from
lagging behind in this important field of
endeavour, is fully participating in world
movements to reconcile conflicting interests.
But it is hard to envisage any overt action
or policy of which one can say "Here is the
remedy, let us apply it." Effort must be
constant and continuous towards a reconciliation of interests and of the public mind, not
only in Canada, but in all parts of the world.
People have to be prepared for a degree of

FEBRUARY 16. 1953
sacrifice and a modification of short-term
national interests in order to bring about
permanent recovery. This is a slow process,
but basically sound progress can be made in
no other way.
Among the various organizations working
towards this common aim is GATT,-the
organization striving for General Agreement
on TarifTs and Trade-which meets yearly.
This constitutes a great step forward. It
is true that, viewing it from the angle of
any particular country, and certainly from
the point of view of Canadian interest, progress has been far short of what we would
wish. However, some progress is evident
from the very fact that representatives of
thirty-four countries, embracing all the
British nations and indeed all the European
countries outside of the Iron Curtain, except
Portugal and Spain, meet yearly to discuss
and bargain. Hundreds and hundreds of
concessions have been made, although major
restrictions still exist. The Commonwealth
Conference recently held in London, which
endeavoured to reconcile many conflicting
interests and to bring forward a common
policy for advancement is, we hope, destined
to reveal another step forward. The point
I want to make is that continuous and constand effort to bring people together, so that
each one may understand the other's difficulties, is essential. Not only the leaders of
countries, but the peoples themselves, have to
realize that a degree of sacrifice and a broad
view of world problems is necessary for the
benefit of all. This is a difficult goal to
reach. We find it so here in Canada. When
prices fall there is a clamour for this form
of protection and for that form of restriction,
and pressure to apply restrictions of various
kinds, and if, in an enlightened country such
as this, national policy may be influenced by
demands for government intervention by way
of trade barriers, it is easy to see the great
difficulties of coping with these problems the
world over.
No country is in a better position than
Canada to take a lead in bringing about a
reconciliation of these conflicting interests
with a view to putting world trade on a
sounder basis. The mover of the resolution
made a very true statement when he said:
"It is as true as the sun rises that debtor
nations can only pay creditor nations with
the goods and services they produce". At
the same time he stated in effect that Canada
should accept sterling in payment for goods
sent to the sterling area. Surely this as a
matter of general practice would put the
sterling-dollar account still - more out of
balance and relegate to the more distant
future the policy that debtor nations should

pay creditor nations with the goods they
produce. After all, if we accept sterling
which cannot be used, the public of Canada
must be paid for these goods either by government loans or more taxes. Rigidity of
policy, however good, may not always be
helpful, and perhaps there may be special
cases of emergency or need or obligation that
would call for acceptance of sterling for
goods. In the broader application as suggested,
however, it could be highly dangerous. Also,
reference was made to two billions of our
securities being held in Europe. This corresponds somewhat with the amount of British
capital invested in Canada, and I presume is
what the honourable senator referred to when
he said that we are paying a service charge

of $1,000,000 a week. But our payment of that

charge in dollars does just that much to
,assist in establishing the equilibrium which
is so much sought for in order to further
promote trade, and it seems to me that there
is no sound reason for increasing the
unbalance by suspending these payments. As
the mover suggested, improvement can come
about only through the exchange of goods
and services.
The mover made a strong plea for convertibility of sterling. Everyone, and none
more so than the United Kingdom, wants it
free. That will do more than anything to
make trade revolve: without it, there will
always be frustration. There again a basis
must be laid for freer exchange of goods on
all sides by tariff adjustment and removal of
restrictions; and the sacrifices necessary for
the common good can only come about
through the widest possible publicity of
mutual needs. The resolution before the
Senate will perhaps in some measure assist
in that respect.
To free sterling prematurely, however,
without an adequate basis will do more harm

bankrupt England by greatly reducing the
value of the pound or, indeed, by making it
valueless.
The building up of reserves is one of the
measures of stability of exchange between
countries. Contrary to what the mover has
said, the maintenance of reserves is not
hoarding. My understanding is that a reserve
for example, Canada's reserve of
-as
American dollars, to which reference has been
made-is just the stabilizing factor in day-byday transactions. It operates just as does
a personal bank account, with funds passing
in and out. If you have no funds in your
account you cannot draw a cheque, and without a measure of sound credit your cheque
is dishonoured.
I am not trying to present a treatise on
foreign exchange. I do feel, however, that

kept in mind.
We all remember the premature freeing of
sterling about four years ago. I know that
in my province of Newfoundland it worked
admirably for a very short while, then
suddenly because of the weak foundation of
unbalanced trade there was a run on the
pound and convertibility ceased. The salted
codfish industry, the industry which has the
largest number of wage earners and producers
in Newfoundland, has through the centuries
had its operations geared to European trade.
The chief buyers on the continent, Portugal,
Spain, Italy and Greece, paid for the fish
in sterling. Brazil and other areas also paid
in sterling. This sterling was earned by
those countries through their trading with
Great Britain and the sterling area. To most
of them American dollars are not readily
available, and some markets, because of our
not being able to use their sterling, had completely closed the door to further trade. This
had brought about a near catastrophe to the
industry.
While it may not bear directly on the
purpose and aims of the resolution, I should
like to present for your consideration Newfoundland's special case in its foreign trading,
particularly in the salted fish industry. For
many years Newfoundland came under British trade agreements and British currency
clearing arrangements with our European
customer countries. In other words, the Newfoundland product was regarded as British.
Since confederation, that has been changed
completely. Newfoundland is in an unique
position in that respect, different from the
other provinces of Canada, which in the
course of years have grown together and
whose economy has been adopted to that of
one another. It is of vital consequence to
Newfoundland that in negotiations between
the governments of Canada and the United
Kingdom special provision be made for facilitating the marketing of this particular product. It is the oldest export product of Canada,
and the government of Canada should keep
this unique problem of Newfoundland in
mind, and press for special facilities for
that industry in its relation with the European
countries. The fishing population of Newfoundland is in danger of being badly
depleted, and once we lose our producers the
fish will remain in the ocean instead of
supplying food to the nations of the world
as it formerly did.
It is of interest to note, and the fish trade
of Canada I am sure is grateful for the
fact, that the Right Honourable Mr. Howe,

on his recent good will tour, presented to
the presidents of the southern republics where
fish is imported. a tronhy of a fisherman in
his fishing suit and holding a fish over his
shoulder. That was a thoughtful act on the
part of the minister.
We all recognize, of course, that the
exporters of every province have suffered
from a dislocation of trade. Newfoundland
is more vulnerable than any other province,
because of its dependence on limited products
its complete reliance on exports, and also
because it bas practically no market in the
other provinces of Canada.
In reference to Canada's foreign trade
generally, there is no one answer to this
perplexing problem. Certainly the answer is
not taking sterling and freezing it, since this
does not attack the basic causes of the trouble.
It is true that Canada is pressing steadily
on many fronts in its attempts to assist in
the restoration of free trade. I have already
mentioned the general agreement on tariffs
and trade, under which world tariff barriers have been substantially reduced. Canadian efforts have also been revealed through
a loan for trade amounting to well over $1
billion which Canada made to the United
Kingdom in 1946. There is also the trade
liberalization scheme in the British West
Indies, the token import plan in the United
Kingdom, Canada's participation in the World
Bank, and the International Monetary Fund,
as well as the Anglo-Canadian continuing
committee on trade. These are progressive
steps, and while a complete solution has not
been reached the policy is constructive and
in the right direction. These all work to a
useful pattern, but I should like to emphasize
that, because of the complexity of the problem,
very careful consideration should be given
to formulating a policy that will have its
roots in really fundamental measures and
not in merely temporary relief.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. John J. Kinley: Honourable senators,
first of all I should like to thank the honourable gentleman from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) for yielding to me the right to take
part in this debate tonight. I should not have
spoken this evening were it not that I am
leaving tomorrow for the United States, where
I shall spend a few days, and I did want to
make a few remarks on the important subject
raised by the resolution.
I should like to congratulate the honourable
gentleman from Southern New Brunswick
(Hon. Mr. McLean), the mover of the resolution. He has had practical experience in
world trade and also in finance. The committee will no doubt be given the benefit of
the wide knowledge that he has gained from
this experience.

FEBRUARY

The resolution is a timely and salutary one,
which I have no doubt will result in a lot
of facts being brought to light. In my opinion it is fortunate that such a resolution is
to be considered by a committee of the
Senate. When I was a member of another
place I always had high regard for the calibre
of Senate committees. I felt they were composed of practical men with long experience
in business and public life, who came to this
house because of their qualifications to advise
the government on important matters and to
review legislation. I look forward to the
meetings of this committee with interest for
I am sure that a great deal of help will come
from them.
The success of a country in world trade
depends on two fundamental things: first, its
natural resources and their intelligent development; and secondly, its industrial and economic life. Those things, it seems to me, are
most essential contributions to trade.
Foreign trade is in a class by itself, and
the test as to whether a country will succeed is its ability to be efficient enough to meet
competition. Lack of efficiency prohibits a
country from entering the markets of the
world.
In spite of the complex and disturbed
world of today, Canada seems to be doing
her part well. Canadian people may well
be proud of their industrial development and
export trade. In the current movement to
expand export trade on an international basis,
we are well out in the forefront. Our achievements thus far are to be cohimended.
But many other nations of the world are
having great difficulties in finance and trade;
and we are concerned that nobody bas yet

remedy in the circumstances.
that we may properly analyze the trade picture, we should reduce it to its simplest
factors. In mentioning the danger of getting
into the realm of something one does not
quite understand, I am reminded that the
governor of the Bank of England once said
that finance had got into the realm of mystery, and even he did not understand it.
On the question of foreign trade, I think it
is our job, in the light of our experience,
to reduce the subject to its simplest form.
If Canada is to take her proper place in
meeting world needs today, she must have
greater immigration. Foreign trade, after
all, is simply the buying and selling of goods
and services on an international basis. That
being so, is it not obvious that we should
bring more people into our country, feed
them here and let them produce here? The
greater our population, the greater our
internal trade and general prosperity.

16, 1953

The honourable senator from Southern New
Brunswick (Hon. Mr. McLean) said that while
the United States were exporting only five
per cent or six per cent of their total production, Canada, in order to keep trade in
balance, had to export some twenty-five per
cent of her total. It must be remembered
that five per cent of the United States total
is greater than twenty-five per cent of the
Canadian total. The United States, with
their population of 150 million, consume and
produce much more than we do, and have
an internal economy which, on a percentage
basis is nearly self-sustaining.
In my opinion, the question of immigration is a most important one. With a large
population, we would be in a better position
to sell our goods to other countries, because
we could buy more from them to meet the
needs of our .own people. By way of a longterm policy, Canada can derive great benefits
from immigration.
One might say that Great Britain, despite
her large population, still has difficulty in
carrying on world trade. It should be pointed
out that a balanced trade requires that a
country be able to supply goods for its own
needs. Britain has never been able to feed
her own people and supply them with the
many things they require.
Further, stability of world trade requires
stability of governments. The history of
England tells us that she not only loaned
money to the world, but she was a producer
for the world; she built railways and public
works in Canada and in the United States,
in India and in Asia. Her investments in
each case were moderately secure, and when
a country did not pay up, there was a demonstration of force which indicated to it the
advisability of paying its bills. That situation does not exist today. Indeed, the great
world organization, the United Nations, rather
interferes with the collection of debts.
England developed Iran and made some
money out of her investments there. Why
should she not continue to benefit from them?
Fifty years ago England's interests in Iran
would have been secure; but they are not
secure today. A solution to such a problem
might be a world court which would require
nations to pay, through somewhat the same
procedure as is used for making and realizing on claims in the lower courts of our
land. Without confidence there can be no
business, and international stability impossible unless nations are ready to honour
their obligations.
It was stressed that the pound sterling
should be made convertible. Well, all of us
would like to àee convertibility, but who can
That is a problem for

SENATE

Britain. If today free convertibility were
established it is probable that the pound
woulcd depreciate another 20 per cent andi
the commercial fabric of Britain would be
further imperilled. At this time is is impossible for Britain to free the pound. It was
only after long consideration that the Canadian dollar was left to find its own level, and
in our case things turned out very well. But
the freeing of national currency is practicable
only when a nation is in a position industrially
and financially to stand the strain, and at
the present time Britain is very far from
being in that position. Last year, when I
was on my way from Norway to England, a
man offered to exchange my Norwegian
money for the British equivalent, and as a
result I obtained £12. When I arrived in
England I was asked at Customs how much
sterling currency I had, and I told the official
I had £12. He said, "You are allowed to
bring in only £10, and we are expected to
enforce the rule strictly. However, I was
permitted to take it along. But when I left
England I was not allowed to take out more
than £5. When a country imposes controls as
rigidly as that, one can realize how difficult
a position it is in. There is no doubt about
Britain's position, nor as to the brave fight
they are making to get over the hill. At one
time they largely controlled the world's trade
and exchange, but successive wars have
drained them of their money and compelled
them to surrender or otherwise lose a great
part of their overseas investments. Today
they find it very difficult to balance their
national budget.
Much the sane conditions obtain all over
Europe. Money values change almost overnight, and as one goes from one country to
another, money changers supply you with the
then value of the currencies which you are
exchanging, while the Customs people impose
limits on how much you can take in and
how much you can bring out. Today, I
believe, the French franc is worth only onethird of a cent; the Belgian franc is in a
slightly better position; Dutch currency is
fairly stable, German currency is better, and
the stability of the Scandinavian countries
is reflected in the relatively high value of
their currencies. With these experiences in
mind, it occurred to me that, financially
speaking, a United States of Europe would be
a valuable achievement, because their fiscal
position would be helped by the combined
strength of the member states. As we know,
there is now an agreement which permits
free trade in steel, coal, and other products,
with a view to more economical marketing.
I think that is the best news of the kind we
have heard for a long time. It will develop

their strength and enable them to overcome
other barriers between them. At the present
fime, it seems to me, the money of one
European country is practically useless in
another.
On this continent we are in the fortunate
position of having only two nations occupying half a hemisphere. Go from coast to
coast in Canada, and you get the same money.
Or visit the United States, and currency
presents very little difficulty. But outside
North America one major difficulty is the
instability of governments. An American
can invest money in Canada without misgivings, because he has a good assurance of
security and very little difficulty about
exchange. But what incentive can there be
to invest money even in Britain? Excellent as
is her reputation for security, money earned
cannot be taken out of the country, even by
her own citizens. In general, the situation
in the world today is such that it is hard
to justify foreign investment: so many factors combine to create instability. It is fortunate for us in Canada that we have great
stability in government.
The honourable senator who inoved the
resolution insisted, as a reason why he thought
trade restrictions should be removed, that they
are man-made and that therefore there is
nothing sacred about them. I am ready to
agree with him, but the trouble is that all
regulations are man-made and no other kind
can be imagined. The Almighty, it seems,
does not noticeably interfere with trade. And
these restrictions, it seems to me, are more
difficult to remove than some people imagine.
My honourable friend said that one must
take into account human nature, and national
pride, and remember that the policies of
states which are trying to improve their
position may not coincide with our own.
While in a free country trade is largely the
affair of individual citizens, in European
countries it is controlled by governments.
Our practices in this respect, I think, are
preferable, because, as the President of the
United States recently reminded us, the best
government is that which governs the least.
Certainly most Canadian business men will
agree with that.
To my mind the only way to correct the
unbalanced trade situation is for creditor
nations to invest abroad and to lower their
tariffs. The tariff of the United States is
built largely on the economy of protection.
They do not take kindly to the free importation of any other than primary products; and
even as regards some of these, our experience
in Canada has not been altogether fortunate.
We like to see a low tariff but it is always
very difficult to obtain.

stand up against unemployment anywhere.
Actually, there is no such thlng as free trade
in the world today. I for one certainly
believe in freer trade. I think that the problem of trade today should be considered not
a political one, but rather an economic one,
that can be solved only by scientific research
,and international good will.
Last year I travelled to Europe on an
Italian ship, and I remarked to some Italians
on the way, "Well, America has sent the
people in Italy a lot of things". But I
gathered from their remarks that they did
not like the Americans too well, so I asked
them. what the trouble was. They replied,
"Well, they have sent us over boots and shoes
and clothing, but we have men who are out
of work and we would rather see them producing these goods". So it is not always
helpful to send goods to a country whose
people could be employed in manufacturing
them. Almost everywhere in Europe you get
the idea that the kind of aid the people are
getting from America is not always welcome.
They maintain they would sooner have theit
own people employed in producing goods of
the kind sent to them. After ail, employment
is what is needed, for when you have employment you can provide your own goods and
services.
We have talked a great deal about the rate
of exchange. At the present Urne we enjoy
a premium of from 2 to 3 per cent on
exchange between Canadian and American
dollars. This sort of thing is good sometimes,
but at other Urnes not so good. When your
money is at a premium. it has the samne effect
as lowering your tariff, and this proves
advantageous to other countries with whom
you are trading. When the Canadian dollar
was at a discount of 5 per cent with the
American dollar, the fishing interests in Nova
Scotia could make a good profit on the turnover of their fish; but now that the American
dollar is at a discount of 3 per cent they find
it difficult time to realize any kind of a profit.
Therefore, it is not always wise to have your
money at a premium. In this case it is good
for Canada at large, because our total purchases in the States are greater than our
exports to them. In other words, if our
dollar is worth more than theirs it works to
our advantage when we import from them,
but when we export it is a different matter.
My idea for a good economy between Canada
and the United States would be to have these
countries travel along together as closely as
68112-18

possible. If this could be done, I think
everybody would be happy and satisfied. I
arn convinced that we should strive towards
this end in our trade relations with the great
country to the south.
The honourable senator from St. John's
West (Hon. Mr. Pratt) spoke about salted
fish. Canada exports a great deal of salted
fish,, particularly to the West Indies. .The
West Indies dollar was so low that trade was
not profitable there, and they eventually
considered salted fish to be an essential
product and subsidized the industry. That is
why we are able to export sait fish to the
West Indies. Our trade with Cuba has been
more advantageous, because it pays us in
American dollars. That is why we have
courted trade with that country.
The impression I gained from travelling
a littie in Europe was that Canada and the
United States, because of having such a high
standard of living and paying such high
prices and waýges for goods and services, are
going to price themnselves out of the world
market. If you travel to Germany today you
will flnd that that country is doing exceedingly well and, has a growing foreign trade.
In many cases she is able to undersell manufacturers on this side of the world. For
instance, in the export of hardware to South
Aimerica, Germany has every advantage
because she can produce more cheaply than
we can in North America. We must not forget
that world trade is a highly competiUive field.
Canada and the United States are ini danger
of losing world -markets to Japan as well as
to Germany.
The United States have kept to the forefront of world trade because of their
economic strength, scientifie progress and
wonderful technique for mass production.
Just look at one American product, CocaCola. This soft drink is sold ail over Europe,
where the organization for its sale is tremendous. Many American products are sold al
over the world, and I arn convinced that the
armed forces of the United States have served
as great agents for the promotion of their
goods, which have been carried into almost
every foreign country. America, however, is
apt to lose much of its huge world trade if
it continues to pay such high prices and
wages for goods and services. We in Canada
have been worried about our trade situation
for years. 1 remember when Canadians used
to say, "Look at the amount of iron and ol
we purchase from the Americans. Oh, if we
only had iron ore and some of Rockefeller's
oil." The lack of these resources seriously
affected the economy of Canada at one time,
but now we have our own oll fields and are
able to export titis product to the United

SENATE
States. We will soon have iron, too, and will
be able to export sonme nf thiq product to our
American friends. Canada is in a splendid
position to maintain its purchasing power, to
keep its money at a high standard and thus
command respect on all the markets of the
world.
People sometimes speak lightly of money.
But it should be remembered that money is
the economic lifeblood of a country; that
while a man may leave this world, his money
stays.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Some of it does.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: The government
takes it.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Still it goes for the economic benefit of the country; and sound
money is a good and salutary thing for a
country like Canada.
The development of oil production will no
doubt bring more investments to this country,
and will help to maintain the Canadian dollar
at a high level. We would not want to see
it go too high, but it is comforting to know
that our money, take it almost wherever we
will, has value. That is a privilege not
enjoyed by the people of every country.
The Right Honourable Mr. Howe has just
returned frorn a trip to South America, where
he was attempting to obtain markets for
Canada. I believe he made a splendid effort,
and I hope that his mission will bring results.
The West Indies, by reason of their proximity
to Canada, would seem to offer a ready
market for us, but they are required by
currency regulations to buy in the British
markets. We in the maritimes feel that there
should be a free opportunity for trade with
the West Indies. My honourable friend said
that an attempt was being made to open that
market to Canada, but it does not seem to
have got very far. Canada, with her surplus,
and following the example of Great Britain
in earlier days, could very well help to
develop the West Indies. In that way we
could find safe investments for our money on
this side of the Atlantic, as well as finding
a market for much of our goods.
It has often been said that this continent,
for trade purposes, should be divided north
and south instead of east and west. We do
not need to make that division when we
have the West Indies so close at hand.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Come out west.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: The West Indies and parts
of South America are capable of supplying
us with the goods we require from tropical
countries, and it seems to me we should do
everything we can to cultivate trade with

them. If Canada is to lend money, I think
she should give consideration to the capital
needs of the West Indies.
The lowering of tariffs would be helpful to
trade. However, we cannot forget that the
United States, the great consuming country
of the world, controls world trade today, and
unless tariff barriers are lowered and goods
from Britain and other countries are allowed
to be sold in the United States, American
dollars will remain hard to get and foreign
trade will be curtailed.
The honourable leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) spoke about trade with
Korea. I would almost go along with him
in his observations. Although I am not speaking advisedly as to what should be done to
bring the Korean war to an end, it seems
to me that the President of the United States
is justified in doing what he thinks will
hasten a settlement of the differences over
there. I am strongly of the opinion that
any country which has soldiers fighting in
the East today should not be trading with
China. After all, there is only one railway
from Russia to China, and if China could
not get goods from other nations of the
world it would soon find itself in a difficult
position. I believe that we should be most
careful not to interfere with what the President of the United States is attempting to do
to bring confusion to our enemies over there.
The problem is a delicate one, and I am sure
we do not completely understand it.
In conclusion, I return to my earlier subject of immigration, in which I am most
interested. My people, on my mother's side,
came from Hanover some two hundred years
ago. They were sent here by the British
government, and for some years were maintained by it. I am happy to say that through
the centuries they have become self-supporting, independent, and progressive citizens of
this country.
I was interested the other day to hear the
honourable senator from Margaree Forks
(Hon. Mr. MacLennan) claim for the Scots
a close connection with the British Crown.
I am reminded that Louis, Prince of Lunenburg, from Hanover, became George I of
England, and that the reigning family of
England today are descendants of King
George I. There are therefore no people
in Canada closer to the Crown than the
people of Lunenburg county, which this year
celebrates its two hundredth anniversary.

SECOND READING

Hon. Thomas Wood moved the second reading of Bill D-5, an Act to incorporate Canadian Pipelines Limited.
He said: Honourable senators, I should like
to give a brief review of this bill to incorporate Canadian Pipelines Limited. As the
bill indicates, the head office of the company
is to be at the city of Regina, in the province
of Saskatchewan. The company may estab-

lish other offices and agencies elsewhere,
within or without Canada, if deemed
necessary.
The petitioners for this incorporation are:
Mr. George Herbert Barr, solicitor; Mr.
William Purdon Cumming, solicitor; Mr.
Robert Milliken Barr, solicitor; Mr. Archibald
Turner Brown, managing director, and Mr.
Frank Benjamin Poutney, investment dealer
-all from the city of Regina-together with
such other persons as may become shareholders in the company. Incidentally, I may
say I am very pleased that this company
proposes to have its head office in Regina.
As the bill indicates, it is the present
intention of the company to transport natural
gas from Alberta across Saskatchewan and
Manitoba. The company proposes to build
this line initially to Winnipeg. It is, of course,
impossible to say now whether in the future
the .company's operations may extend to other
parts of Canada. This will depend upon the
availability of sufficient supplies of gas, prospective markets, and other considerations
which cannot be foreseen at the present time.

SENATE

The resolution also suggests that we should
examine any project for developing economic
collaboration, specificaily between Lie coutries who are signatories to the treaty, and
how such project can be co-ordinated with
the trade policies of other countries of the
free world. That also is important.
In the third place, it is suggested that we
examine whether and to what extent it is
possible to reach an understanding that would
give the economic collaboration the same
period of life as is provided for in respect of
the military relationships; that is, twenty
years.
It is altogether a good thing that a committee
of this house should examine into these questions and hear what evidence it can secure
as to the merits and the practicability of the
proposal set forth in the motion to which I
have just referred.
This matter of an expansion of trade is of
peculiar significance to Canada. Participating
in the North Atlantic Treaty are fourteen
countries-including Greece and Turkey,
which gave their adherence within the past
year-with a very considerable aggregate of
population and trade. Certainly it is worth
while to see whether anything can be done
to increase trade between all these partners
associated for the specific purpose of their
joint defence. I suggest that, of these fourteen nations, not one is more vitally interested
in the subject-matter of the motion than is
Canada. In the calendar year 1952 our total
exports exceeded $4,350 millions and constituted about 20 per cent of our gross national
production. If one contemplates for a moment
what would have been our situation had this
volume of exports been cut in half, one .can
readily realize its significance. A shrinkage
to that degree would have caused widespread
unemployment all over the country. For that
reason alone it is of the first importance that
we do everything we can to maintain and
extend our foreign trade.
What are the exports we provide for the
world? As every honourable senator knows,
they are many and varied. One item of great
significance, and of peculiar interest to
honourable members from Western Canada,
is wheat. On this matter the report of the
Canadian Wheat Board for the crop year
ended July 31 last gives some very interesting
data. For instance, in the crop year August
1, 1951 to July 31, 1952 Canadian wheat, and
four, the product of wheat-was sold in
sixty-eight countries. Of these, twenty are
in Europe, twelve in Asia, sixteen in the
Central American and Caribbean area, nine in
South America, ten in Africa; and in addition
there is the United States. The total quantity

of wheat exported to these countries in the
period I have named exceeds 357 million
bushcls. The very wide distributinn of our
markets in this one commodity, is evidence
of the importance of international trade to
Canada. In the same period Canada exported,
mainly to European, United States and Japanese buyers, more than 70 million bushels of
barley. As regards other exports, I understand that 90 per cent of our production of
paper goes to the United States. Canadian
pulp products are ýsent to markets all over the
world; and, as our colleague from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) is well aware, our
sales of timber are no less widely diffused.
The same statement applies to our output of
base metals. In 'short, Canada is a great and
almost unlimited storehouse of raw materials,
and on our ability to find markets for them
depends the extent to which we can import.
In turn, the degree to which we import is a
very important factor in the maintenance of
our standing of living.
There are certain difficulties in the way
of trade today, which the honourable gentleman from Southern New Brunswick (Hon.
Mr. McLean) referred to when speaking to
his motion. Unquestionably, these difficulties are the result of the last Great War,
which upset the economic balance everywhere in the world-although even before
that time signs of difficulties were commencing to arise in the realm of international
trade.
It is curious how nations, like
individuals, resort to all sorts of schemes to
improve their economic position. After the
war we had quota and exchange regulations
and all the paraphernalia of controls in a
very widespread fashion. Fortunately for
Canada, and I think very wisely, we have
eliminated practically all of these controls.
Just offhand I cannot recall one that we still
retain.
The position of Great Britain and of the
whole sterling area is very different. Britain's
position is difficult, partially because of
reasons entirely beyond her control, and
partially for reasons over which she might
have a considerable measure of control.
Britain was the great free trade country of
the nineteenth century. She traded all over
the world and wisely left the profits of her
trade as investments in other countries. By
the end of the nineteenth century her investments abroad were paying her a very large
yearly income, to which we in Canada contributed our share. Furthermore, in the
nineteenth century the United States made
heavy borrowings of capital from Britain, as
did South American countries.
Indeed,
British capital was being invested all over
the world, and the earnings of that capital,

FEBRUARY 17, 1953
plus the earnings from steamships, insurance
and banking exchange, provided Britain with
a great deal of the substance that she used
to pay for her imports of food and raw
materials.
Two world wars completely upset Britain's
economy. She has found it necessary in large
measure to dispose of her overseas investments in order that she might more effectively
prosecute these wars. In the early years of the
last war she mobilized her North American
securities, both in Canada and in the United
States, and sold large quantities of them to
Canadian and American buyers, to get the
dollars with which to buy essential materials
for prosecuting the war. That left her without the income of those investments for the
I think, too,
future. They were gone.
Britain's problem has been aggravated by the
uncertainties of the period since the end of
the war. I am not giving my own opinion
on this, but the opinion of very responsible
British students and publications. There can
be little doubt that Britain's great adventure
into the welfare state disturbed her economy.
One can understand that the war weariness
of Britain's people after five years of a conflict of terrific intensity left them in a letdown state.
I do not for the moment imagine that there
is any quick or easy solution to this problem
of convertibility, the problem of making the
money of the sterling area, the pound, easily
and readily convertible with the American
and Canadian dollar. It may be a long time
before that can be done fully and freely as
was the case before the first World War, or
even between the two World Wars. Suggestions have been put forth that this might
be accomplished by Canada and the United
States making very large dollar loans to the
International Monetary Fund, and by the
Fund using these dollars to assist the sterling
area in maintaining their imports. That would
simply be lending money to your customuer
to buy your own goods, and in the end there
would inevitably be trouble and difficulty
over that. So, I repeat that in my judgment
there is no easy solution to this problem of
convertibility, but that does not debar us
from giving the fullest consideration and
study to it. It could well be, of course, that
my judgment is entirely wrong. I hope it is.
At any rate, we propose under this motion
to examine and inquire into that business,
and I think it is very important that we do so.
The next point to which I should like to
refer is our trade with the United States.
By far the greater volume of our import and
export trade is with that country. Sometimes
I get impatient with expressions of opinion
one hears in Canada to the effect that our

trade with the United States is growing too
large, and that it is feared this trade may
be upset. I do not think there is any fair
warrant for that assumption. Those who talk
in that fashion-and there are some not a
great distance from where I am speaking
now-have not fully realized all the factors
involved in this. It is said that the United
States is uncertain in its tariff policies, that
it is unpredictable, and that no one will
ever know what may happen from one year
to another. The record does not bear that
out. It is said that the United States is subject
to pressure groups. I grant that this is so,
for we have all read about lobbies at Washington pressing for legislative favours in one
way or another. And I am bound to say that
this sort of thing is not entirely unknown
in our own country. I recall that a few years
ago we had a very animated discussion on
the question of whether we should have
margarine in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I recall further that pressure was exerted-some of it right in this
chamber-against the proposal that margarine
should be manufactured and sold. Also, in
the textile field we have witnessed the actions
of pressure groups who imagine that the
breath of more competition would be disastrous to their welfare. More recently we
have seen evidence of pressure in another,
though somewhat smaller areaHon. Mr. Beaubien: But sweeter.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: -where people who call
themselves sugar beet growers are demanding of the government the damming back of
imports of Cuban sugar. The people who
hold such views have no imagination and
no sense of humour. If they would take
an objective look at themselves they would
realize that. But they propose that at least
14 million sugar consumers in Canada should
agree to pay a higher price for sugar in order
that a few hundred sugar beet growers in this
or that community could more certainly
operate at a profit. That proposition is completely absurd. When we talk about pressure groups in Washington, let us not forget
that occasionally there is a mote in our own
eye in the form of pressure groups in
Canada.
The record of our trade relations with
the United States-and I shall deal with it
very briefly-does not warrant the fears
expressed in certain places as to what may
happen if we trade too freely with our neighbours to the south. It is well within the
memory of at least some members of this
honourable house that in 1911-forty-two
years ago-Canada negotiated a reciprocity
arrangement for the free exchange of natural

products with the United States. When the
question was submitted to the arbitrament
of an clcction, the people of Canan

to accept it; but that offer to Canada remained
on the statute books of the United States
for about ten years, until in 1922 the famous
Fordney-McCumber tariffHon. Mr. Ross: Infamous.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: -was introduced in the
United States.
At that time Congress
rescinded the offer of reciprocal trade with
Canada, and the United States embarked upon
a program of high tariffs.
In the United States the period from 1922
until the early thirties was unquestionably
a period of both economic and political isolationism. The ideal of a league of nations,
sponsored by their notable president of that
day, Woodrow Wilson, was rejected, and
with the foolish notion that politically and
economically they could live within themselves, they washed their hands of Europe
and the rest of the world.
Not satisfied with the Fordney-McCumber
tariff, the United States took a further step
in the wrong direction by introducing, in 1930,
the Hawley-Smoot tariff, which erected even
higher tariff barriers. The policy of isolation,
which continued for a period of ten years,
resulted in one of the worst depressions that
country has ever known. When, in 1932, a
new government came into power, it set about
to redress the balance.
I should perhaps have said earlier that after
the Democratic party came into power, early
in 1913, the American tariff policy was set
by the Underwood tariff, which as I recall
in large measure reduced the duty on nearly
all imports. It may be said that in the main
the Democratic party has been the low tariff
party of the United States. The Republicans
were in office from 1921 until 1932. Early in
1933 the Democrats came back into power
and within a few years reciprocal trade agreements were developed by Secretary of State
Hull. These have been extended and expanded
over the years since that time.
The conference held in Ottawa in 1932 led
to the plan for the development of a trading
area within the British Commonwealth of
Nations by a system of preferential duties.
We then thought-at least some people
thought-that our trade problems had been
solved. As a matter of fact, the late Lord
Bennett-then the Right Honourable R. B.
Bennett, Prime Minister of Canada-was
negotiating with the United States for a
reciprocal trade arrangement when he went
out of office in 1935. That to me is an illustration that while we may imagine we can

control the currents of events, their compulsion sometimes overwhelms us.
r

n for a

m

n thp reciprocal

trade agreements negotiated by the United
States. No one in this country will deny that
the trade agreements which Canada made
with the United States, first in the autumn of
1935 and renewed three years later, and the
arrangements which exist under the Geneva
system, have been of immense value to the
Canadian people.
There was a good deal of misgiving in some
Canadian quarters when at the recent United
States elections the Republican party was
returned to office. Many felt that this would
mean a revival of the old protectionist system.
However, that has not come about, and I
venture to say that it is unlikely to
come about.
One of the
most significant features of President Eisenhower's
State of the Union message to Congress was the emphasis placed on the
need for renewal of the reciprocal trade
agreements which expire this year. Unquestionably the president will ask Congress to
renew these agreements. Already he has
urged the importance of a revision of American customs regulations. Not only the United
States, but Canada and probably other countries, have discovered that there are more
ways of making it difficult to import goods
than by putting on duties of varying percentages. The customs regulations of the
United States are due for an overhauling;
and it is significant and of some interest to
us that the president has recommended this
as one of the things for congress to attend
to. What will result is as impossible to
predict as are the contents of the budget
which will be introduced in another place this
week. But beyond doubt the Republican
party contains strongly progressive elements
both in the sphere of international politics and
of international trade; and as for their
opponents, traditionally the Southern Democrats are in favour of low tariffs. I for one
shall be rather disappointed if President
Eisenhower does not get his way in this
matter.
There is another aspect of this question as
far as the United States are concerned. I
said earlier that policies often are subject to
the compulsion of events. At the end of last
December the population of the United States,
as estimated by its census bureau, was 157
millions. At the present rate of growth it
will have increased eight years hence, that is
by 1960, to 175 millions; and by 1970, eighteen

years from now, if the rate of growth is maintained, it will be over 200 millions. In the
same period our population, of course, will
also increase. But surely no Canadian, be he

FEBRUARY 17, 1953
in public or in private life, will deny the
importance to us of a market of 160 million
people, right at our doors in a few years
time. This rapid growth in the United States
population is one of the most significant factors in relation to Canada's future. For today
the United States are increasingly dependent
upon other countries for many of the things
required to maintain the American standard
of living. I have already made mention of
our sales of barley. The United States also
provides a large market for our livestock, for
quite a range of our agricultural products,
and for many of our base metals, including
aluminum, copper, lead, and zinc.
Our American friends are learning, perhaps the hard way-though they can learn
pretty quickly when they set their minds to
it-that for a country to continue to export it
muist also import. That axiom is as true today
as it ever was, and it is becoming more widely
recognized. One sees it reflected in the
unanimous declaration a few months ago of
the Detroit Chamber of Commerce, which,
after making a study of international trade,
demanded complete elimination of tariffs. If
that strikes one as going very far, it is certain
that it reflects the belief of their membership
that substantial reductions should be made;
and their arguments were based on the solid
ground that a nation cannot sel! unless it is
prepared to buy. The United States Chamber
of Commerce has taken somewhat the same
attitude, and leading newspapers, both Democratic and Republican, are on record to the
same effect. Upon his recent visit to the
United States that grand old man, Winston
Churchill, voiced the standpoint of the British
people when he said, "We want trade, not
aid". So, in spite of pressure groups here
and there, one can see a steadily increasing
realization of the fundamental factors which
underlie economie life in the United States,
as everywhere else. Our policy should be to
work as fully as possible along these lines
with the United States.
This resolution touches only indirectly on
what may be termed external affairs. I venture here a suggestion, for which I hope I
may have some support in the house, that
it would be a good thing if we could have this
session a full-dress debate on our foreign
policies. Unquestionably the world today is
passing through a period of tension. I am
not an alarmist, but I doubt whether for the
past several years the strains and stresses in
the relations of Great Britain and some other
Commonwealth countries with the United
States have been greater than they are at
this moment. This sort of thing could have
disastrous consequences; and surely there is

enough wisdom and tolerance in the western
countries to avoid playing into the hands of
Russia.
I regret some of the criticism which has
been directed against President Eisenhower
for his declaration with regard to Formosa.
I want to make it very clear to this house
that I am not among the critics. On the contrary, I believe the president had ample
justification for the step he took. The
criticism amuses me, because some of the
very people who are making it criticized the
policy of President Truman in 1950, after the
outbreak of the Korean war, when he said
that the 7th fleet would patrol Formosa
waters and prevent Chiang Kai-shek from
making any attack on the Chinese mainland.
At that time President Truman's policy was
denounced, as likely to lead to war with
China, by the same individuals who today
are denouncing President Eisenhower's move
as likely now to bring about war with that
country. Well, I for one do not think that
in the present tense struggle throughout the
world we are going to be successful anywhere
by adopting any kind of a policy that smacks
of appeasement of the communist powers.
Sorne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I am not for war. War
would be a devastating, terrible thing to
happen to the world; but I am opposed to
exhibitions of weakness and division which
play into the hands of the dictators in the
Kremlin.
We need to keep our courage
and our resolution strong, and above all we
need to bring as near home to the Canadian
people as we can the fact that the vital issue
is freedom for the world. Today the world
is divided into two sections: those who adhere
to what we call the democratic system, people
who believe that freedom is fundamental to
the happiness of mankind and to the progress of civilization; and, on the other hand,
the dark forces of tyranny that will subjugate the individual and make him a mere
cypher in the cog of a state machine. These
people are unquestionably planning-and not
with short-range plans either-to force their
system upon the world. In the face of this
we need to be clear in our purpose, resolute
in our faith, and strong in the conviction that
we are on the side of right, moderate and
fair always to those who work with us. If
we are, then I think we can help to reach
a solution of not only the political difficulties
throughout the world, but of all the economic
problems which this motion sets out so very
well.
Sorne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

SENATE

Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I should like to add a few observations to the debate un tihis rcsolution. First
of ail, I would point out that for the last
year or two I have more or less had to
dissuade the mover, the honourable gentleman from Southern New Brunswick (Hon.
Mr. McLean), the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Canadian Trade Relations,
from proposing a study of how best to
encourage trade between the free nations of
the world, a subject which I know is very
close to his heart. He desired to move this
resolution early in 1952, and again just prior
to the Christmas recess of the present session,
but on both occasions I had to request him
to postpone action because of the legislative
program then before the Senate. It is hardly
necessary for me to remind the house what
a great contribution various Senate committees have made in recent years by their
inquiries into public questions, such as taxes,
finance, and so on. It has never been for
me to say whether these inquiries should or
should not be carried out, but I have always
endeavoured to keep our work reasonably
within the capacity of our clerical staffs.
While I had to dissuade my honourable colleague from proceeding with his motion in
the past, I now welcome the opportunity to
facilitate his inquiry because, aside from any
other reason, there is no subject in which I
am more keenly interested than international
trade.
Honourable senators, I need hardly refer
to the importance of the question of trade
between nations. This is not a new subject
by any means, for it has been discussed back
and forth during at least one hundred years.
The existence of trade or the lack of it has
had a profound effect upon the fortunes of
For instance, I am
nations and peoples.
sure that any inquiry into this subject would
bring forth reasonable arguments that World
War II itself may have had its very genesis
in the question of trade relations. Indeed,
Stalin himself has said in public that the
trade question will be the cause of the next
world war. So it is a subject of tremendous
importance and, since practically nobody
opposes it in the abstract, it is a wonder to
me that a greater degree of success has never
been attained in solving the problems connected with it. I suppose that the support
for greater international trade in the abstract
comes from an unconscious feeling that it
would increase the prosperity of individual
countries, because they would be able to sell
their goods more easily. But, as the honourable gentleman from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) has pointed out, trade is a two-way
street, and if you are going to export to a
country you must also import from it. This

is where things have broken down in the past.
Many have preached the benefits of competitinn but have immediately made every effort
to avoid it.
A great deal has been written about this
subject in the abstract, but one of the
articles that have impressed me most was
written by Arnold Toynbee, perhaps the
world's foremost living philosopher and hislorian. Reviewing the present world events
in the light of world history, he makes this
compelling statement:
The western nations, all told, are only a small
minority, not much more than one-fifth of the
human race.
These nations are still indulging in the extravagance of trying to live in watertight compartments, each sealed off from the rest by migration
restrictions, by tariffs and quotas limiting the
movements of goods and by exchange restrictions
limiting the movement of money.
Our western community today is spending about
three-quarters of its political energies and depriving itself of about half of its potential economic
resources in desperately struggling to go on keeping up these internal barriers that have now
become not only useless but perilous for us . . .
We cannot afford any longer to keep up any
internal barriers, inside our western world, that
are found to be handicapping us in our joint
defence and therefore to be endangering the
survival of our common values.

As was said by the sponsor of the resolution (Hon. Mr. McLean), and repeated by the
senator from Queens-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr.
Kinley), Canada's trade today is buoyant, and
there is hope against hope that that buoyancy will be maintained. While I do not
want to interject a pessimistic note, some
highly competent but less optimistic authorities share the view expressed by the honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.

Recently there was sent to me a most interesting article written by Dr. Clair Wilcox, the
first United States chairman of the trade
delegation to London in 1946. He has served
on trade delegations in Geneva and is recognized as an authority in his field. In a
speech delivered as recently as last December
be divided his remarks on trade into three
divisions, namely, where we are now, where
we should be, and where we are likely to go.
I shall attempt to summarize briefly his
observations.
Dr. Wilcox pointed out that the trade position of the United States has been attained,
and the reduction of tariffs has been achieved,
through thirty-three GATT agreements, and
some eleven pre-GATT agreements; and that
as a result of all that, the Hawley-Smoot
tariff has on the average been cut in half.

they were so insistent. No thought of partisanship affected their decision. So in this connection the remarks ot 1r. Wilcox whiun i

have quoted, and the observations of my
honourable friend relating to a broader
foreign policy, are, to say the least, intriguing,
and they should stimulate thinking along
this line.
Of course this is not the first attempt at
a regional economic program. The honourable
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
has referred to the proposed agreement
between Canada and the United States; there
were also the Ottawa agreements; and more
recently we have watched the organization
of Benelux in continental Europe. This latter
was certainly brought about "in the context
of foreign economic policy as a whole", and
it is one of the most striking events in the
recent history of continental Europe. About
a week ago the governments of France and
Germany committed themselves to absolute
trade in coal and other products, an agreement affecting a joint population of some
155 millions. I believe that next April the
agreement will extend to steel and its
products, and consideration is being given to
similar treatment with respect to medical
supplies and transportation facilities. How
long, one wonders, but for the danger to
which France is exposed, would it have taken
to overcome the inborn protectionism of
powerful elements there, as elsewhere?
Some opposition may be raised to undertakings such as those contemplated by the
resolution, on the ground that, as they affect
primarily and specifically the fourteen countries which are signatories of NATO, they
are too exclusive. Honourable senators will
recall that Canada and the United Kingdom
are the only units of the commonwealth that
are members of NATO. Incorporated in the
resolution is the suggestion that the project
should be co-ordinated with the trade policies
of other countries, but the primary consideration is greater trade between NATO countries. One has already heard it predicted
that NATO may supplant the United Nations.
Personally, I do not think it will. I again
refer to Arnold Toynbee, who, alluding to
the relationship of NATO to the United
Nations, states:
The United Nations is not, in fact, a political
community: it is a political forum, in which questions can be debated and opinions aired but in
which no act of government can be performed. Yet
we cannot do without this forum, however successful the development of NATO may be, so long as
the United Nations remains the closest approach
the United States and the Soviet Union can make
to one another; for to meet-and even to quarrel-in a forum is far better than never to meet at all.

This statement may be considered in connection with the fact that the framers of

NATO, in the opening clause of the charter,
refer to it as a part of U.N., not as superseding
iL. Thisrationship of NATO and U.N. is one
which the president of the United States
evidently believes is likely to continue, and
not as in any way detrimental to the United
Nations. As I read his inaugural speech, he
looks forward to other organizations, a development of NATO elsewhere. Clause 7 of
his speech states:
Appreciating that economic need, military security and political wisdom combine to suggest regional
groupings of free peoples, we hope, within the
framework of the United Nations, to help strengthen
such special bonds the world over. The nature of
these ties must vary with the different problems
of different areas.

I do not know specifically what this means,
but the president presumably is taking into
account that the NATO program for the
Middle East embraces a defence force which
is expected to operate from the frontiers of
Turkey to India, or perhaps Pakistan, and
ultimately a defence pact extending from
India to Japan. NATO, comprising the free
peoples of the West, may be enlarged into
an undertaking by the free peoples of the
East to defend themselves from absorption,
in whole or in part, by a common enemy.
Thereby the free peoples of the East may
agree that, with help, they will defend themselves against becoming potential Koreas in
whole or in part.
To my way of thinking this is a most
logical development. But there is one difference. While it is possible to have around
the perimeter of the communist world a
Middle East grouping, a Far East grouping
and NATO, for a long time to come the
NATO countries would be expected, because
of their economic strength, to look after the
military and economic requirements of these
two regional groupings as well as their own.
In my opinion it would require every bit of
economic strength that the NATO countries
could muster to carry out such a scheme.
So it seems to me that a pretty wide and
comprehensive program will be involved if
we are to approach this problem on any
basis of co-ordinating, without being too
restrictive, the various trade and economic
policies of the countries concerned.

I do not wish to discourage the mover and
seconder of this resolution, but I doubt
whether our committee will have sufficient
time to deal with this important subject
before parliament prorogues early in May.
For one thing, I think the witnesses
appearing before the committee would require
a longer time than that to prepare their
evidence.
I do not say this, however, to
deter the mover and seconder from proceeding with the inquiry, for I doubt whether a
more important or basic question has ever

FEBRUARY 17, 1953
come before the Senate. Indeed, I want to
commend these honourable gentlemen for
having brought this subject to our attention.
Some hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Trade negotiations are
being carried out. Honourable senators will
recall that the prime ministers of the commonwealth met fairly recently in London.
In a short time Mr. Eden and Mr. Butler of
Great Britain will be visiting the United
States to discuss trade matters with the
government of that country. Their slogan
"Trade, not aid'' is very expressive, and I am
sure they will be endeavouring to establish
multilateral trade on as permanent a basis as
possible. Despite the fact that the Canadian
and American governments favour, as did the
Truman administration, the increasing of
multilateral trade between the nations of the
free world, there are always strong forces
opposed to the idea. Strong forces were
opposed to it in the last two or three years,
a period during which we experienced
unexampled prosperity, and common sense
tells us that as competition increases-and
it is bound to increase-the latent forces
which have been opposed to these things in
the western world in the past will be even
more strongly opposed to them in the future.
It seems to me that in approaching this question it might be wise to ascertain whether, to
use the words of Dr. Wilcox, our trade policy
should not be handled in the context of
foreign economic policy as a whole instead of
being isolated and exposed to attack.
I should like to make a few remarks as
to what the impact on the Canadian economic
life would likely be if the objective of my
honourable friends were achieved. Those
parts of Canada where industry is based on
natural products, in the primary or secondary
form, would stand to gain tremendously. I
am thinking, for example of the area which
extentds from Manitoba to the West Coast,
the St. Lawrence basin, the Maritimes and
Newfoundland. Markets, however, are the
primary requirements for trade and we know
what happens when we lose them. That the
economy in those parts of the country would
benefit, can be taken for granted. There is,
however, another segment of the economy of
Canada, and a very important one, located
principally in the basin of the St. Lawrence.
It is that type of industry which might be
referred to as a secondary industry, or a
Canadian industry that has been chiefly
built-up behind a protective tariff. In this
industry there are some branches of American
firms and some British.
I think that all the natural resources
people would contemplate a permanent and

steady reduction of tariff s with considerable
pleasant anticipation. My view is that
these strategically located primary industries,
enjoying the advantage of cheap power and
so on, would gain more than they would lose
in getting a reciprocal American market; but
I am not an expert in these matters, and I
really do not know.
I would point out that in the implement
business, Canada and the United States have
carried on a trade back and forth without
any kind of tariff restrictions. Here, of
course, the business done by each country
in the other has been about equal. In other
words, Americans have bought as much equipment and machinery from us as we have
bought from them. This might be another
basis for agreement, and the committee might
well examine into this aspect of the question.
I am not really in a position to comment
on Newfoundland, and I would rather leave
its particular problem to members from that
province. The honourable senator from St.
John's West (Hon. Mr. Pratt), for example,
who took part in this debate last night, is
much better qualified than I am to speak
about Newfoundland's trade problems. Broad
and long, I would think that being part and
parcel of a much larger trading area would
be very beneficial to the province.
In conclusion, I should like to say a few
words on behalf of the maritime provinces,
from which I come. It is most interesting
to speculate on how the economy of the
maritimes would be affected if the objects of
the resolution were attained. The result
would be a change in Canada from a primary
market of 14 million people to a trading area
populated by 350 million people, embracing
all the NATO countries.
We in the maritime provinces, regardless
of the benefits which were conferred upon
us by Confederation, have felt, rightly or
wrongly, that our geographical position
placed us on the fringe of the markets of
Canada. True, compensations for that geographical disadvantage have been secured
by way of reductions in freight rates, subventions on coal, and other means. But the
events of recent years, such as the constantly
increasing freight rates, plus the trend away
from the use of coal as a fuel, have to a
great extent retarded the maritime provinces
from both a manufacturng and a trading
standpoint. While some of the traffic which
flows back and forth across Canada passes
through our ports, nevertheless the position
in which we find ourselves is not a happy
one.
I can remember being prepared, when
a young man, to join a party for the repeal
of my province from Confederation. I arn,

recorded for posterity. But the present picture could be completely changed by the
extension of our trading area from the west
coast of Canada to the Iron Curtain countries
in the east, to include approximately 350 million people. What effect such a move would
have on the economy of the maritime provinces, I do not know, but certainly it would
remove those provinces from the fringe of
the market to its centre.
It is a well known fact that the maritime
provinces do not have the quantity of hydr>electric power which exists in the valley of
the St. Lawrence River or in the province
of British Columbia. On the other hand, a
friend of mine who is an authority on the
subject recently gave me some figures on the
potential value of coal on tidal waters for
the production of power. I emphasize the
fact that I am speaking only of its potentiality. My information is that the coal
mines of the Atlantic are potenially capable
of producing more power than the combined
output of Shipshaw at Arvida, Kitimat in
British Columbia, at full development, and
Niagara Falls.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What about the Passamaquoddy?
Hon. Mr. Reid: What quantity of power is
to be produced?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: My information is to
the effect that maritime coal is capable of
being converted into more power than the
combined output of the three power plants
I have referred to.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: How long could the production be kept up?

Hon. Mr. Robertson: I am informed by my
scientist friend that Nova Scotia's present
annuai procuction of six million

ons of coal

could be converted into twice as much electrical energy as is now produced by Shipshaw, and one and two-thirds the volume to
be produced by Kitimat at its full development. As to the time factor, which my honourable friend asked about, the estimate is
that these figures would apply over a period
of 300 years. By way of further calculation,
if the present output of coal were doubled
to 12 million tons a year, twice the output
of power that I have indicated could be
produced over a period of 150 years. I am
sure it does not worry the youthful members of this chamber to know that this huge
volume of power could be maintained over
a period of only 150 years. Obviously, by
that time coal will have been replaced by
atomic energy. I have attempted to point
out to my honourable friends the impact that
such changes as proposed by this resolution
might have upon the economy of such a small
portion of Canada as the maritime provinces.
That area has a strategic position, a source
of unlimited power, and close proximity to
large deposits of iron ore; and it is blessed
with a highly intelligent people who could
take advantage of great opportunities if-and
I emphasize that little word "if"-we have
markets for our goods.

be heard from. As the subject of beet sugar

SENATE
has already been mentioned in the debate,
I should like to take this opportunity of
making a few remarks albout I.
It may be called to mind that in 1857, or
nearly one hundred years ago, Captain
Palliser, on behalf of the British government,
explored what is now the prairie provinces.
He marked out an area, roughly triangular
in shape, which he considered unfit for cultivation. Experience over the years has
shown that his judgment was not far wrong,
for in eight out of every ten years since the
country was opened up for homesteading
the rainfall in that area has been deficient
and the yield ruinously low. So desperate
did the situation become, that a few years
ago the government felt compelled to introduce the Prairie Farm Assistance Act, under
which almost every farmer who had suffered
a crop failure could receive the so-called
"dry bonus", which was an amount up to
$500, in lieu of the crop they lost. Approximately one-third of the money -used for this
purpose came from the farmers themselves
by way of a 1 per cent levy on all grain
marketed, and the remaining two-thirds from
the treasury of Canada.
Also there was placed on the statute books
the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act, under
which about 50,000 dug-outs and small irrigation reservoirs have been constructed. In
this operation the dominion government has
supplied the engineering advice and paid
part of the construction costs. At the present
time about half a million acres in that area
are under irrigation, and work is going ahead
rapidly, with the co-operation of the federal
and provincial governments, to bring under
the ditch an additional three-quarters of a
million acres.
Wheat is the best crop in the dried-out
areas. But where water can be applied artificially to the land, independently of the
rainfall, such crops as fruits, vegetables,
alfalfa and, particularly, sugar beets, have
a prominent place. The growing of these
crops leads to the opening up of canning
factories, deep freeze plants and plants for
the processing of sugar beets. As the population of the district increases, the existing
plants are enlarged and more plants are
established.
Sugar beets can be grown very successfully
in the area to which I refer. It is most
inspiring to watch the process: great quantities of beets are washed and scrubbed in
water, and eventually end up in the form of
pure white granulated sugar. That sugar is
just as wholesome and of the same formula
as granulated sugar produced from cane.
Production of sugar beets in this area, where
there is a considerable amount of sunshine

and where water is made available artificially, averages about twelve tons per acre.
Beenisq

of

the large amount

of

sunshine

the sugar content of the beets is about 17
per cent, which is considered extremely high.
The sugar beet crop is not only a cash crop,
but it is a sure crop. Wheat may be destroyed
by rust. Other grains may fall victim
to some pest, such as the sawfly; potatoes
are often affected by blight; but the sugar
beet will withstand all such pests and diseases, as well as a large amount of hail and
frost. And because of its by-products, the
sugar beet may be regarded as a double crop.
The by-products from an acre of sugar beets,
for the purpose of feeding livestock are equal
to the total production from an acre of corn.
Perhaps I should give some detail on this
matter of the by-products of sugar beets. The
beet top is sliced off, and with the leafy part
there is removed a small amount of the beet
itself. For feeding purposes one pound of
beet tops is considered as valuable as half
a pound of grain. There is also the pulp,
which can be dried and stored indefinitely.
As feed for milking cows, it will increase the
flow of milk; and feeders gain more rapidly
in weight on it than they do on other types
of food. A further by-product is molasses.
It is not considered profitable to extract sugar
from the beet beyond a certain point, and the
remaining beet juice is available in the form
of molasses.
On the average, a ton of beets will produce about eighty pounds of molasses; or, if
one is so inclined, he can convert a ton of
beets into about four gallons of alcohol. And
small rootlets are used as feed for swine. With
all these by-products, the sugar beet crop
can quite properly be regarded as a double
crop.
The sugar beet is valuable as a rotation
crop; it can be followed by a cereal crop,
which will then yield 80 per cent more than
it otherwise would. As a rule, the cereal
crop is followed by alfalfa, and then by
another crop of sugar beets.
The growing of beets provides more tonnage for the railways. Further, as I have
said, it is a sure crop, and of a type which
will keep young people at home on the farm.
It provides a new market for building material and certain kinds of machinery. A further point to be made in favour of this crop,
is that people who grow beets are not obliged
to live on an isolated and lonely homestead,
but may reside in a populated area where
they can enjoy the benefits of community life
and have a good supply of the protective
foods.

FEBRUARY 18, 1953
I should like to pay tribute to the men who
have invested rtheir rnoney in costly beetsugar factories, their control of which they
regard as a public trust. Specially trained
experts are enýgaged to look after the cultural
methods, and their aim is to enrich the soil
and maintain its fertility for the use of
generations to corne. The factory owners
enter into contracts with the growers early
in the season, make an initial payment, and
allow the growers to participate in the profits.
In the past the owners and growers -have
faced serious difficulties in obtaining materjais, labour and markets, but by their enterprise and continuing efforts they have solved
these difficulties and have made a great contribution to the happiness of the people in
that district. I would like to point out here
that they have received a lot of help and good
advice f rom our honourable colleague from
I would
Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan).
also pay a tribute to the government for the
attention and help it has given to that branch
of the agricultural industry, and I would
press for its continuance, even in spite orf
some annoyances to which the government
may have been subjected. The greatest tragedy of the recent decade out there was the
destruction of the forests on the eastern slopes
of the Rocky Mountains. The dominion and
provincial governments, acting to)gether, have
so deait with the problem that water from
the mountain streams will flow down gr-adually from the area instead of descending in
torrents and floods.
Refined sugar imported into Canada is
taxed at $1.89 per hundred pounds-a duty
of almost 25 per cent-and that impost is
being maintained. The Minister of Trade
and Commerce has just returned from a good
will market-seeking expedition, and he has
assured the people of the Maritîmes-those
little provinces down by the sea to whom
we owe so much-that they can continue to
get sugar from Cuba and enjoy the Cuban
market for theïr fish, potatoes and other
products. He has also stated that Cuban
refined sugar will not corne into the districts
of Western Ontario where some of the factories are located, nor into the Prairie provinces. These things have been of very great
value, and are much appreciated.
It may be, honourable senators, that I have
wandered f ar afield. I can only hope that
from the deliberations of the proposed comrnittee there will emerge policies which will
add to the sum-total of human happiness and
welf are, and which, by fostering good will
and mutual understanding, will go far to
banish hatred amongst nations.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators, in
rising to take part in this debate I want at

the outset to say that the subject-rnatter of
the resolution concerns flot only the other
non-communistic free nations, but definitely
affects this great country of ours. I arn fully
aware of the significance of the resolution as
well as of the complexity of the problem,
which, dealing as it does with the intricacies
of foreign exchange and international trade,
goes even far beyond the lirnits of discussion
in this honourable chamber. The matter of
foreign exchange is highly technical, and its
ramifications can be understood only by a
specialist. It is therefore with sorne feeling
of humility that I approacli the subj ect; not
as an authority on currencies or finance, but
as one who views the matter in its practical
aspects, in the light of today's events.
1 suppose, honourable senators, that if the
world were operated under a system whereby
each and every country lived to itself, we
in Canada would still do better than most
nations. But I have always contended, both
on the public platforin and in private, that
the nations which have provided in the fullest
degree this world's goods and luxuries for
their citizens are those which have gone out
to trade, and trade freely; while countries
which have built barriers around themselves
somewhat like the so-called Iron Curtain,
do not enjoy as fully those gifts which God
intended for them.
Let me at this point comment on some of
the statements made by preceding speakers
in this debate.
First of ail, I would refer to the statement
of the honourable senator from Churchiill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) that the present unbalanced
state of affairs is a result of World War II.
To that Temark I take exception. 1 believe
that the Hawley-Smoot tariff of 1930 was
the beginning of the conditions from which
we are now suffering. It may be remembered also that at that tirne there was in
Canada a Prime Minister who set out to
match the Hawley-Smoot tariff, and to such
effect that, according to my information,
Canadian tariffs were raised in his administration to a h.igher level than at any time in
the previous thirty years. The prevailing
principle from -1930-35 was "do everything
here", and I weil remember that it was a
hard doctrine to buck on a public platform,
because it was easy to convince the idle
shoemaker or the unemployed textile worker
that if boots or clothes were made in this
country everyone would lie employed. I amn
not going to take Up time to go further into
that, for we ail know what happened when
1935 came along. But other countries followed the example of the United States; and
it will lie remembered that, stili later, other
nations-of which Japan, for instance, was

SENATE
one-started to deflate their currencies with
a view to overleaping the high tariff walls.
So, I repeat, the high tarins of the Liities
were a great factor in bringing about World
War II, and it is not correct to say that the
present crisis began with the war.
The honourable member from Churchill
also spoke about the world being divided
into two camps, with the free nations on one
side, and those behind the Iron Curtain on
the other. I wonder how many honourable
senators have seriously pondered the fact
that, aside from what is going on behind the
Iron Curtain, a formidable world revolution
is in progress. It is independent of Communism, or so-called Communism; it is a
revolt against unnecessary misery.
Recently Mr. Gerard Filion, Editor of
Le Devoir, of Montreal, attended the World
Peace Conference in Peking. He has since
published a series of articles which are well
worth reading. I do not think he can be
accused of sympathy with Communist Russia.
I am not going to read extensively from these
articles, but in confirmation of what I have
said about the existence of a world revolution against unnecessary misery, may I
remind honourable senators of what he says
about the outlook on life of the Chinese
whom he met.
He says:
Socialism is an ideal to these under-fed peoples.
It is part of the scheme of material progress. They
don't want any part of the Western systems under
which they have suffered. They are told that in
the Soviet Union no man exploits another. They
see that the Soviet Union has a higher standard of
living than their own. That is enough for them,
even if they are not Marxists; even if they are
opposed to the atheistic and materialistic conThey are attracted to it
cepts of communism.
anyway by the promise it holds out of material
security.
Side by side with this admiration of socialism,
which is sometimes fanatic and sometimes naïve,
goes a hatred for the Western powers which are
lumped together collectively as capitalist dictatorships. This hatred is intense.

His articles give us cause for thought, and
I quote these statements to remind the house
that in many countries there is an urge to
have more of the good or necessary things of
life. One could perhaps say that the world
is divided into two groups; the "have" nations
Fortunately,
and the "have-not" nations.
Canada is in the "have" group.
The honourable Senator from QueensLunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley) gave his views
on immigration when taking part in this
debate. This is always a good subject to talk
about, but I entirely disagree with the idea
entertained by many people who advocate an
expanding immigration policy for Canada.
They seern to think that the more people we
have the happier and better off we shall be;

but, though I am not against immigration, I
do not think so. The people in the United
States--omc 157 milions cf them-are no
happier or better off than we are in Canada.
In fact, many Arnericans would like to live
as Canadians rather than as U.S. citizens.
The honourable gentleman from QueensLunenburg also spoke about the development
of our natural resources. I should like to give
a word of warning about the great resources
which we hold in trust for ourselves and for
our future generations. Within a period of
sorne fifty years the United States have
wasted a substantial part of their great heritage of natural resources. Where are they
going to go for what they are beginning to
lack? The great developments that are taking
place in our Canadian northland are being
sponsored to a great degree by American
businessmen. I would urge the federal and
provincial governments of this country to be
very careful about how these great natural
resources and reserves of ours are used. In
my opinion there has been no greater example
of the waste of natural resources than the
waste which has taken place in the country
to the south of us.
I come now to the speech made by the
honourable leader of the government (Hon.
Mr. Robertson). I am sorry he is not here,
because I want to commend him for the
contribution he made to this debate. I think
his speech was just about one of the best I
have listened to on this subject. He alluded to
the Schuman plan which was put into effect
in Europe, and which the Honourable Mr.
Pearson recently mentioned in the House of
Commons. I have read something about the
Schuman plan, but I wonder how many other
senators have done so. And how many people
in Canada realize what the Schuman plan
means to the economy of the countries concerned, and as well to the economies of other
The
countries, including perhaps Canada?
leader also spoke about NATO, and the fact
that the United States have handed over their
right to decide war for the next twenty years.
Well, so did Canada hand over this right.
Canada will no longer have a say in this
regard as long as she is a member of NATO.
The Schuman plan, which was proposed
on May 9, 1950, involves France, West Germany, Belgium, Holland, Luxembourg, and
Italy. Great Britain and the United States
are not members of this group. When
European businessmen speak of a free market
they do not mean, as we would, an area in
which every purchaser may seek business on
any basis that satisfies a willing buyer and
a willing seller, but rather one in which the
price is identical for all. When a European
businessman speaks of free enterprise he

FEBRUARY 18, 1953
means not only private initiative and responsibility, but the privilege of agreeing with his
competitors on prices without government
interference. It rather appears that today
government planners know better or think
they know better than those actually in an
industry how the business should be
conducted. The Schuman plan is so complicated that very few people really understand
it. The people of Canada and the United
States have not been alerted as to what the
plan really means; they have not been told
what result it may have in the future.
Now that Canada is committed to the
defence of Western Europe it should be our
purpose to examine all such matters in the
light of how they may effect this country in
the years ahead. After all, steel is not produced by government planners. The great
steel industries of Canada, the United States,
Great Britain and Germany were founded
and built up by free enterprise as we know
it. But the move of all governments today
is towards socialism-I mean that all governments, including our own, are either
consciously or otherwise moving towards
socialism-with its inevitable regimentation
and curtailment of freedom. As we are
aware of this fact, it should, in my opinion,
be made plain to the Canadian people. Under
the Schuman plan the price of coal and
steel will be regulated for its member-nations,
as will the quantities that may be imported by
any one of these countries. Once this plan
goes into full effect I shall look for some
trouble in trade for the free countries of
the world. I thought that this afternoon I
would give this warning to the Senate.
I come now to the speech made by the
mover of the resolution (Hon. Mr. McLean).
Whatever criticism I make of his speech will
be made without rancour, but with candour.
He said that payment for goods shipped
from one country to another can only be
made in one way: by goods and services.
Anyone who has even made a cursory examination of these matters knows that there are
two ways to make payment, namely, by
goods and services, and by currency acceptable to the country from which the goods are
bought.
I call to mind the days when I spoke about
silver restoration. How out of focus those
speeches look in the light of today's events!
Those were the days of the gold standard.
The present financial program of most countries, if not all, is to support the value of
paper currency. It is well known that the
United States today are carrying on deficit
financing by the use of paper book-keeping
or accounting. As long as the people have
faith in that, Lt is as sound as any currency.

Indeed, this paper I hold in my hand could
be made legal tender, and if the people of the
country had faith in it, it would then have
value as money.
Realizing that the speeches being made on
this resolution, and the proceedings which
will later take place in committee, may well
be circulated to other countries, I am disappointed to note that the sponsor of the
resolution used the word "England" instead
of "Great Britain". I make that observation
in no critical sense; but, after all, there are
a good many people in the United States who
seem to have more faith in Great Britain than
in England. Such people may interpret the
use of the word "England" to mean England
only, and no other country.
The sponsor of the resolution spoke in
detail about sterling. Of course, Britain used
sterling in the days of the gold standard. I
call to mind events of, I think, 1928, when the
Prime Minister of Great Britain said that if
she ever went off the gold standard the world
would collapse. Well, it has not collapsed,
but I will admit that in so far as currencies
are concemed, it is in a terrible mess.
I am wondering what the United States
are going to do with their $22 billion worth
of gold. One cannot blame some wild-eyed
socialists for questioning a system under
which men spend their lives digging gold out
of the earth, transporting it 3,000 miles, and
planting it in another hole in the earth. At
the moment they can see no good in that
process.
While I realize my suggestion might not
be accepted, I believe it might be well for
the United States to consider distributing
the gold chips among the countries of the
world. Despite all that we hear, gold still
ranks as a precious metal and is not something to be easily overlooked or discounted.
The sponsor spoke of the position of the
countries of the free world. I have dealt with
that phase of the discussion in my reference
to the article by Mr. Filion.
The meat of the resolution, it seems to
me, will be its effect on the future policy and
action of the United States, and perhaps
on the trend of events in this country.
I should like to call the attention of honourable senators to an article by Sumner H.
Slichter in the January issue of the Atlantic,
and to read a few extracts which bear out
and support what I have said. They have
to do with the crux of the whole trouble
involved in sterling exchange, principally as
it affects the United States. Professor Slichter, in his article, says in part:
. . . Stalin's lengthy pronouncement on Russian
policy in the magazine BoLshevik all indicate that

SENATE
Russia is taking a new look at her policies and is
about to make new efforts to divide the countries
of the West.
These developments follow closely the acute
foreign exehange crisis among many non-Communist countries in the first half of 1952. This
criais, the third foreign exchange criais since the
end of the Second World War, bas eaused the
sterling area to lose haif of its gold and dollar
reserves; it bas led Britain, France, India, Australia,
South Africa; New Zealand, and other countries to
mnake drsstic cuts in their imports; it has caused
the
British
Trade
Union
Congress
to pass
unanimously a resolution demanding expansion of
trade with the Soviet Union and Communiat China;
it is forcing Britain and France to cut their defence
outlays below the targets set at Liabon last winter;
and it is bringing about high-level taîka between
the British and Americana in Washington early this
year on the fundamentals of world economic
conditions.
The failure of the United States to provide an
adequate economie foundatien for its for>eign policy
has been due to the fact that the economie difficulties of the non-Communiat world have been
grievously undereatimated. It was originally hoped
that the post-war recovery of production would in
a few years enable the principal countries to
restore the convertibility of their currencies, and
that generous aid from the United States for a few
years (the Marshall Plan was for five years) would
permit most countries to raise output to the
needed levels. The United States bas put more than
$35 billion into foreign aid. and the output of
Western Europe is more than 40 per cent above
pre-war. There bas also been a big increase in
trade between countries, including a large rise in
sales to the United States. And yet only very
limited progress toward achievlng the convertibility of most currencies bas been made-as is
indicated by the foreign exchange criais of 1952.

A short time ago the United States placed
an embargo against certain of Canada's
agricultural products. I arn sure, however,
that if we had found ourselvea in similar
circumstances some definite action would
have had to be taken in Canada. There are
I believe, some twenty-eight agricultural
items on which the United States government
has placed a ceiling; and the government will
buy ten of those items when the farmers are
unable to seli them. Imagine what would
happen in this country if the people of, say,
British Columbia demanded to be allowed
to import New Zealand butter at 25 cents a
Pound. Think of the protesta that would
descend on Ottawa from the dairy farmers
in the central and eastern provinces.
This whole matter of trade is linked up
not simply with customs and tarifas, but with
regulations and subsidies, and God knows
what else. Hence, at the outset I took the
view that this resolution -involved certain
great problems.
In another part of Professor Slicbter's
article he has this further to say:
The greateat single obstacle to, American efforts
to build a strong community of non-Communiat
countries bas heen the difficultY of these countries
in selling to the United States . . . This possibility
(of greater sales) is created by the so-called

Are we in Canada not facing a somnewhat
similar problem. wben we talk about imports?
One has only to read the recent speech by
the Minister of Trade and Commerce to
learn of the pressure which certain interests
have been trying to put on bimn in regard
to the importation of aýugar. I arn juat waiting to see what will happen when Japan
begins to ship her goods into this country. It
will be interesting to note what attitude will
be taken by those who now talk loudly about
free or freer trade. In my opinion we have
a certain duty to perform; and while we are
looking at other countries we had better
take a second look at what we ýourselvea
are doing. When one gets to the nub of the
whole thing, it must be admitted that along
with the great prosperity enjoyed by Canada,
as well as the United States, there bas come
a degree of selfishness such as has neyer
been witnessed before, and it will make
itself f elt wherever public men run for office:

(b) any person has or had Canadian domicile,
the minister shall decide the question and the
decision of the minister is final and conclusive for
the purposes of this act.

Honourable senators will also observe that
the records of the Immigration Branch are to
be prima facie evidence with regard to lawful admission to Canada and the granting of
permanent landing. If, however, there is no
record in the Immigration Branch, proof
satisfactory to the minister must be given
to him before he can favourably decide the
question of domicile as affecting a prospective citizen. The same discretion is to be
found in clause 18, on page 14 of the bill,
namely, that when any doubt exists as to
whether a person is or is not a Canadian
citizen, the minister may, in his discretion,
issue a certificate of citizenship.
If honourable senators will return to clause
1 of the bill, which I abandoned when I went
to clause 18 to follow the thread of the
changes, they will note that the word "issued"
is added. A certificate of citizenship may
be issued or granted under two conditions:
the minister has the right to grant citizenship,
but there are persons who are entitled to
citizenship as of right, and, therefore, to a
certificate as of right. So this bill makes for
the first time this distinction: it gives the
minister the right to grant; it gives the
department authority to issue.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I can remember that some
years ago, when a bill dealing with naturalization came up in the other house, the minister asked for authority to grant, of himself,
naturalization.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Euler: My recollection is that the
proposal was-perhaps
quite properlydefeated. Does this bill seek to confer that
authority?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: In part, at least. It
gives the minister in his discretion power to
grant a certificate that a person is a citizen,
and that is pretty close to the right to grant
naturalization.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Is that to be done without
going through the usual form of having the
Mounted Police make an examination of the
applicant, and the posting of the application
in a court house or elsewhere for, I think,
three months?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: And examination by a
judge.
Hon. Mr. Euler: And examination by a
judge-yes.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I would think so, but
I can assure the honourable senator that, in
my judgment, the minister will not ordinarily
68112-191

use this power. Only in very special circumstances, when citizenship should be or may
be granted, would he set aside the machinery
by which citizenship ordinarily is obtained.
Hon. Mr. Euler: But he could.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Well, be could, in circumstances such as this: if somebody declares
that be is a citizen, and there is doubt as to
the grounds upon which be bases his claim,
the minister, under the terms of the bill,
could say "You have made out a case: you
are a citizen, and here is your certificate".
Hon. Mr. Euler: That is a little different.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Is not the feature which
my honourable friend is explaining very
similar to a provision enacted in 1931, when
the late Honourable Mr. Cahan was Secretary
of State? If I remember rightly, the naturalization act was amended at that time to permit
the minister to make a declaration which
would effect naturalization. I may be wrong,
but the provisions seem to me very similar.
I wonder if the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) could
compare them?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I have not in mind the
act of 1931, but something of the kind is found
in the Immigration Act, which gives the minister the right to resolve doubts. But if this
bill is passed the minister will, I believe,
possess broader powers than be had before.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Under this clause would
the minister have the right to grant citizenship to a person who has escaped from one of
the Iron Curtain countries and landed in
Canada, and for whom deportation might
mean death?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The circumstances the
honourable senator has mentioned might give
the minister a reason for doing so. Certainly
his actions will be based upon governmental
and national policy. At the present time,
people in Canada who are citizens of the old
Germany and have property in East Germany
are losing that property unless they happen
to be citizens of some other country; and
there have been cases-one has occurred in
my own practice-of applications by German
citizens for Canadian citizenship to enable
them to avoid the loss of their property in
East Germany as a consequence of having
left that country, and by reason of the rapacity of the government of that particular
state. I do not know what policy will be
adopted in this respect, but it is one of the
matters which may be considered in relation
to the power to be conferred upon the minister to grant a certificate. One's imagination
is not adequate to cover all the multitudinous

SENATE

cases and classes of cases which may arise,
and with which, as a matter of policy, the
minister may wish to deal.
Turning to the next subject of these amendments: it has always been clear that a child
of a natural-born Canadian citizen is a Canadian citizen, even though he be born abroad,
but it has not been so clear in our legislation,
or in the opinion of the officials who administer it, that the same principle applies in the
case of Canadian citizens who have been
naturalized. This bill removes all doubt on
that question. It is now made clear that
there is no distinction in that regard between
citizens. Clause 2 of the bill repeats section
4 of the act and substitutes a new section 4,
which provides, in subsection (1), (b), (iii):
A person born before the first day of January,
1947, is a natural-born Canadian citizen, if ... his
father
(iii) was, at the time of that person's birth, a
person who had been granted, or his name included
in, a certificate of naturalization.

There it is spelled out, and there will be
no more confusion in that regard.
The clause which next follows will not be
understood unless honourable gentlemen bear
in mind that for many years British subjects
have been coming to Canada, residing bere
for five years, and then considering themselves, without formality, Canadian citizens.
This bill provides that the legal domicile of
a British subject who has resided in Canada
for twenty years prior to January 1, 1947, is
presumed, and for the purposes of the bill he
is considered a Canadian citizen. This, of
course, is a rather notable amendment to the
Citizenship Act. Sub-paragraph (iv) of subsection (1) (b) of new section 4 reads:

has a dual nationality. or two types of potential nationality: that of his father, which
might be Canadia, and that off the land of
his birth.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Does it not work both
ways? For instance, if someone is born of
United States parents in Canada can he not
select whether he will be a United States
citizen or a Canadian citizen?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I believe that is right.
I think it is reciprocal. A United States
citizen can claim Canadian citizenship or his
own citizenship for his children who are born
in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Howden: Is there any time limit
on that?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is what I am coming to. It is perfectly obvious that a condition of this kind cannot continue indefinitely
to any age of the child. It has been my
understanding that in the past the right to
select one citizenship or the other continues
until the individual concerned has performed
some act, such as voting, which denotes a
choice on his part.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Is there not a provision
whereby a person, upon attaining the age of
twenty-one, must make an election one way
or the other within a certain period of time?

Hon. Mr. Euler: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is being provided
for in the bill before the house.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That has been the case all
along.

born after the commencement of the Act, the
year of grace does not apply, of course. In
those circumstances his father must have
registered the child's birth within two years
thereof, and the child must either file a
declaration of retention of Canadian citizenship or, in the alternative, return to Canada
and establish domicile, in either case within
three years after attaining the age of twentyone years.
This provision makes it very definite what
is to be done in the troublesome situation
where people of Canadian parentage are born
abroad and desire to retain their Canadian
citizenship.
Hon. Mr. Howden: As I understand the bill,
it provides that up to 1947 chldren born
outside this country of Canadian citizens may
obtain Canadian citizenship. But if a parent
has lived outside Canada for a period up to
ten years, can his children be registered as
Canadian citizens?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The actions of a parent
after a child has been born have no effect
on the citizenship of the child.
Hon. Mr. Howden: But the child does not
have to be born in Canada to become a Canadian citizen?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No.
Hon. Mr. Howden: Then, how many years
may a person live outside Canada and still
have his children registered as Canadian
citizens?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Perhaps I misunderstood my honourable friend's question. I
thought he had reference to a father. If the
father was born in Canada, he may live outside the country all the rest of his life, and
that fact would have no effect on his citizenship.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I am reluctant to interrupt
my friend again, but may I ask a question as
to his use of the terms "British subject" and
"Canadian citizenship"? Under our law a
man may become a Canadian citizen?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Does that mean if he goes
to any other part of the British commonwealth he is recognized as a citizen of that
branch of the commonwealth?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: This bill endeavours to
deal with the very point that my honourable
friend has raised. In former days there was
no such thing as Canadian citizenship, but
there was the status of a British subject.
A man born in Canada was regarded as
a
British
subject. According
to
the
bill now before us, a British subject

who has lived in Canada for twenty
years prior to 1947-although he may not have
observed any of the formalities, such as the
securing of an immigration landing permitis assumed to have established domicile and
may now be given his Canadian citizenship.
There may be border-line cases, which I am
not at the moment prepared to discuss.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Is Canadian citizenship
recognized in other parts of the commonwealth?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Euler: But heretofore it has not
been recognized?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: By the provisions of the
Canadian Citizenship Act and of this bill a
qualified person is given unqualified Canadian citizenship, and is made a British subject.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I recall an instance during
the First World War when a man who was
an enemy alien by birth, and naturalized
in New Zealand, came to Canada and was
interned.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: That was in wartime.
We did lots of foolish things then.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That may be the
answer. The point I am trying to make is
that a British subject who has long resided
in Canada and who has not been impressed
with the necessity of complying with the
immigration regulations may now become a
Canadian citizen. I thoroughly approve of
this procedure. There is, however, a limitation as to time. Should an individual in the
category to which I have referred be unable
to obtain Canadian citizenship because he
has allowed the three-year period and the
date of January 1, 1954, to go by without
action on his part, he may yet file a petition
with the minister who, in his discretion, may
issue a certificate of citizenship.
In my view, this bill would loosen up the
regulations, and apply common sense and
decency to the method of dealing with British
subjects who in the past have not complied
with the letter of the law.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: May I ask the honourable gentleman just one question? If a Canadian citizen goes to Great Britain, New Zealand, or Australia, is he there recognized as a
British subject?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Does he get any recognition at all?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: He is unquestionably
recognized. A certificate of Canadian citizenship is tantamount to a certificate as a British

SENATE
subject. All Canadian citizens are British
suhjeptk That is recognized abroad, as well
as here.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I apologize for rising to
interrupt my friend again.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No apology is necessary.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Would a citizen of Australia
who enters Canada legally be regarded as a
Canadian citizen and, after the proper period
of residence, be allowed to vote?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: After the proper period
of residence, yes, if he is a British subject.
A British subject who may not have become
a Canadian citizen has the right to vote in
Canada, provided he has the residential qualifications both in the country and in the constituency in which he votes.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: How many years does
he need in order to qualify?
Hon. Mr. Euler: I think it is a year.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It is five years before
he can establish domicile for Canadian citizenship. With regard to voting, I am getting out
of my subject and beyond my depth.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: You are doing fine.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: My impression is that a
British subject in Canada acquires the right
to vote in a period less than five years.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It is one year.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: One year.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I think that is correct.
Clause 5 of the bill refers to Canadian
citizens other than natural born Canadian'
citizens. A British subject who has been in
Canada, after legal landing as an immigrant,
for a term of five years before the commencement of this act, is considered to be a
Canadian citizen without further formality.
In this connection I direct the attention of
honourable senators to paragraph (b) of the
new section 9 (1) of the act. And under
section 10 of the act, such a person as I have
just mentioned may, after January, 1947,
become a Canadian citizen upon application.
Honourable senators will observe a number
of proposed changes as of January 1, 1947.
These would not change the substance of the
Canadian Citizenship Act. To make the legislation more understandable to the hurried
reader, the words "the first day of January,
1947" have been substituted for the words
"the commencement of this act".
Section 10 of the act covers applications for
citizenship. I am not telling the house anything new when I say that one wishing to
become a Canadian citizen must within one

and not more than five years prior to the date
of his application file a declaration of his
intention to become a Canaàdian citizcn. Under
clause 6 of the bill the time for filing such a
declaration is extended to six years before
the application. That, of course, gives the
chap who is applying a little longer period
between the filing of his intention to apply
and the filing of his application. Numbers of
people have filed notice of intention immediately after arrival in 'Canada and have
neglected to present their application within
the following five years. They will now have
six years in which to do so. There are other
reasons. An applicant must have a Canadian
domicile before he can be a citizen, and Canadian domicile requires five years' residence.
The change allows him another year in which
to file his application after he has achieved
domicile.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Can an immigrant file
notice of intention the minute he lands in
Canada?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, just as fast as he
can get up to the office of the clerk of the

court. That has been the rule, and it remains
so. But, according to this bill, he must have
resided in Canada for one year preceding his

application for citizenship.
The bill also provides a further convenience. In

the past both the application

and

the notice had to be filed with the clerk of
the court of the division in which the applicant resided. In cities such as Toronto and
Montreal, where the location of the clerk's
office is well known, no difficulty arises, but
there are remote places, such as the Yukon,

where the same facilities do not obtain. This
bill confers the right to file the notice and the

application with the Registrar of Canadian
Citizenship, who of course resides in Ottawa,
and the clause is added"or '-uch other manner as the regulations may
prescribe".
I understand that what is intended by the
insertion of this phrase is that under special
circumstances persons who wish to do so may
give notice of intention or make their application by mail. No regulation to this effect
has yet been drawn, but the possibility of it
is implicit in this section.
There is, I fancy, only one portion of the
bill which could provoke controversy.
The
act as it stands requires that an applicant for
citizenship shall have an adequate knowledge
of French or English or that he shall have
resided in Canada for twenty years prior to
his application. The new paragraph (e) of subsection (1) of section 10 of the act adds the
requirement that he shall apply before the
first day of January, 1959. This means that

FEBRUARY 19, 1953
after that date an adequate knowledge of
French or English will be mandatory.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: Or Gaelic?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No, sir. Gaelic is not
recognized.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What would be "adequate
knowledge"?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The bonourable gentleman can guess that as well as 1 can. Probably
the applicant will be examined by a judge,
whose decision as to, whether the applicant's
knowledge is adequate or inadequate will, in
practice, presumably be final.
As I have said, I can see therein some possibility of controversy. We may hear from
our friends who speak Gaelic, and probably
fromn others who speak Polisb, Italian and
Ukrainian, and from. other e'thnie groups. I
do not know. In this matter of language
parliamentary enactmnents seldomn accomplisb
much. A language, to become dominant, must
do so on its own merits.
The next clause also raises doubts. The
act gives power to the minister to grant; a
certificate to a minor child who bas been
lawfully admitted to Canada and is the offspring of a person who bimself holds such
a certificate issued before the birtb of the
cbild. To this provision, contained in section
10, subsection (5) of the Citizenship Act, the
bill adds the requirement that wbere the
cbild is fourteen years of age or over an
adequate knowledge of French or English is
essential. So that any child of a person holding a certîficate must, upon its arrivai in this
country, wait for bis certificate until be bas
learned the Frencb or the Englisb language.
By section 20 of tbe act, a naturalized Canadian citizen ceases to be a Canadian citizen
if be resides out of Canada for six years.
There are, of course, a number of exceptions,
such as service abroad in tbe armed forces or
in the public service of the dominion or a
province, or residence abroad as the representative of a commercial or religious organization, or as the spouse or minor cbild
of one of tbe classes mentioned, or of a
natural-born Canadian citizen: tbese people
neyer lose their nationality by living abroad.
But tbe others will lose their Canadian
nationality unless they present their certificate or passport to a representative of
Canada in the locality in wbicb. tbey reside,
and bave it endorsed as extending the time
limit. It will be observed that clause 8,
appearing on page 6 of the bill, extends tbis
period to ten consecutive years; and after tbe
expiration of that time a person may still
petition the minister for resumption of Canadian citizenship. That is good, for we do

not want anybody to lose bis citizensbip ini
Canada witbout good cause.
Clause 10 of tbe bill amends section 38
of the act by giving the minister power to
decide any question as to wbetber a person
bas been lawfully admitted, and so on. This
deals witb domicile and citizensbip, and I
bave already covered it. This concludes my
explanation of tbe provisions of the bill.
Honourable members, the bill itself is
divided into tbree parts and so far I bave
,confined my remarks to part I. By reading
the first f ew paragrapbs of part II of tbe
bll it will be observed that the pu.rpose of
this part is tbat amendmnents similar to those
I bave explained shahl be made in the new
Revised Statutes of Canada, 1952, whicb, are
now on the press and are expected to be
issued before tbe close of tbe ýcurrent session.
Any reference I could make to part II would
be a mere repetition of wbat I bave already
said on part I.
Part III of the bill bas reference to the
coming into force of the Act. I do not need
to bother mucb witb this. If the Act is in
force prior to tbe coming into force of tbe
Revised Statutes of Canada, 1952, it will be
repealed when the Revîsed Statutes corne
into force, so that we shail bave only one
Citizensbip Act. Clause 22, the only clause
in part III, is necessary in order to conform
witb tbe paragraph in tbe Revised Statutes
of Canada wbicb repeals this act.
Honourable senators, tbat is tbe bill in
outline as clearly as I bave been able to
understand it and explain it. It is full of
tanglefoot, because of the amount of
macbinery involved; nevertbeless, in tbe
main tbe legisiation is good and I recommend
its acceptance.
Tbe motion was agreed to, and tbe bill
was read the second time.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators, 1

INTERNATIONAL TRADE
MOTION-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resu-med from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
MeLean that the Standing Committee on
Canadian Trade Relations be empowered to
inquire into and report upon tbe development of trade between countries signatory
to tbe Nortb Atlantic Treaty, and witb other
countries of the free world.
Hon. G. H. Ross: Honourable senators,
Social Credit members of the House of Commons bave recently been advocating high

SENATE
tariffs. For example, they apparently think
14 million Canadians should pay more for
their sugar through higher tariffs in ordet
to benefit a few growers of sugar beets in
Canada.
The most expensive luxury the civilized
world has ever indulged in-one that has
caused more distress, hunger, poverty and
want than any other known-is high tariffs
and other forms of trade restrictions.
Prior to the depression which set in in
the early thirties, many foreign countries
threatened to increase their tariffs. Some did
make increases. However, the world's economists issued repeated warnings that increases
in tariff s would plunge the world into a
severe depression and stir up the danger of
another world war.
At the World Economic Conference of 1927,
200 leading economists nominated by fifty
governments agreed unanimously that the
chief impediment to the growth of world
prosperity was high tariffs. They vigorously
opposed any raise in tariffs and strongly
advocated lower tariffs.
When the Hawley-Smoot high 'tariff bill of
1930, which did so much to aggravate the
depression in the early thirties, was before
Congress, some 800 economists representing
every university of standing in the United
States joined in a protest to President Hoover
against increasing the tariff. They pointed
out that this would be disastrous to the United
States and would provoke other countries to
retaliate and perhaps bring on another world
war.
Canada and the United States both disregarded the pleas of the economists. In
Canada, the government of the day convened parliament in September, 1930, and
blocked trade in every conceivable manner.
The tariff was jumped up, fictitious values
were imposed for tariff purposes, and dumping duties were freely resorted to. A currency exchange duty was collected from
countries with money at a premium as well
as from those with money at a discount, and
steps were promptly taken to cancel 53 trade
treaties.
Let me give you some illustrations of how
high the tariff was raised and how it worked
out in the case of wheat. Prior to 1930
Canada imported raw silk from Japan and
sold ber wheat. A shipment of taffeta that
cost $43.60 had to pay a duty of $168.65. In
some instances the trade restrictions imposed
by Canada were as high as 700 per cent.
Japan retaliated by raising her tariff on Canadian wheat to 331 cents a bushel plus 50 per
cent ad valorem duty. In the result Canada
lost a market for wheat. Japan, rather than
see her people starve to death, went to war
and captured the extensive wheat fields of

Manchukuo. On account of high tariffs, Italy
was unable to buy wheat. She too went to
wa

rather

than

see

her

people strv

and

she captured the rich farmlands of Abyssinia.
Tariffs always provoke illwill, and often lead
to war.
So, too, we had been buying textiles from
Great Britain and selling ber wheat which
entered Great Britain free of duty. Under
the tariff imposed by Canada against Great
Britain in 1930, Canada collected on the general run of goods used by the average family
from 40 per cent to well over 100 per cent.
In 1932 free-trade Great Britain retaliated
by building a tariff wall against the rest of
the world and pegging the price of wheat
grown in Great Britain at
$1.30
a
bushel. Other countries which had been buying our wheat also retaliated.
In 1931 Germany made it unlawful to use
less than 60 per cent of domestic wheat in
milling wheat in that country. Fifteen days
later she required 97 per cent domestic
wheat to be used in all milling. In 1934 she
placed further restrictions on the importation
of wheat. Substitutes and starvation lessened
Germany's imports of wheat by 50 million
bushels a year.
France retaliated in 1932 by increasing ber
tariff and placing other restrictions on the
import of wheat, so that France's imports of
wheat fell off by 35 million to 40 million
bushels a year.
In 1932 Portugal retaliated by refusing
to admit any imports of wheaýt into the
country.

Canada's high tariff laws of 1930 almost
ruined the farming industry. It drove the
price of wheat down to less than 40 cents a
bushel at Fort William-the lowest price
wheat had reached in the last 400 years.
When the Liberals won the election in 1935,
Prime Minister King took an early train to
Washington. Within seventeen days after
the election be was successful in working out
a trade agreement under which the tariff on
close to 1,000 items entering Canada was
substantially reduced. Under the agreement
the United States similarly slashed their tariff
on Canadian products entering the United
States. The tariff on Canadian cattle and
many other farm products entering the United
States was reduced by one-half.
Within one year after the 1935 election,
similar trade treaties reducing tariffs were
entered into with fifteen other countries. The
fight to reduce tariffs by multilateral trade
agreements has been carried on since 1935,
spearheaded by Canada, Great Britain, the
United States and France.
By reducing

FEBRUARY 19, 1953
tariffs, and by other Liberal policies, the
present government has pumped new life
into our foreign trade.
It is by no accident that Canada has
enjoyed its greatest prosperity under these
trade agreements. Canadians know that the
Liberal party lifted the country out of that
terrible depression.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Do you really believe
that?
Hon. Mr. Ross: And they know that the
Liberal party has adopted measures to help
farmers, working men, business men-to help
us all to help ourselves.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: The Liberal party had
nothing to do with it at all.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Order!
Hon. Mr. Ross: The government is still
working out further trade agreements. In
1947 representatives of a number of countries
met at Geneva to discuss a reduction of
tariffs.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Do you not think the
war had a lot to do with the prosperity?
Hon. Mr. Ross: No, I do not.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It had everything to
do with it.
Hon. Mr. Grant: Maybe that was the cause
of the war.
Hon. Mr. Ross: I think the prosperity was
due in a measure at least to action by the
government.
In the year 1948 fifty-three nations, representing 90 per cent of the world's trade,
signed a trade charter at Havana. In it they
agreed to negotiate further for the reduction
of trade barriers. In 1949 another trade
conference was held at Annecy, in France, to
reduce tariffs. The drive to reduce tariffs
is still on.
No nation should be more concerned for the
success of the campaign to lower tariffs than
Canada, as our per capita trade is greater
than that of any other nation in the world.
Hon. Mr. Hornei: Why doesn't the government cut the duty on automobiles? If it did,
then you could talk this free trade stuff.
Hon. Mr. Ross: If I had my way, the duty
would come off a great many things.
In 1930 we stood fifth among the trading
nations of the world. By 1933 the destructive
trade restrictions had reduced us to the
eleventh place. Our market vanished like
mist before the rising sun.
An effective weapon of price reduction
would be the removal of tariffs which hold
68112-20

the prices of many commodities up. Instead
of the upward spiral of inflation, lower tariffs
would introduce a downward spiral of prices
finally affecting every kind of goods.
It would be a calamity to have a revival
of high tariffs. It is unfortunate to have
members of parliament advocating a policy
that proved so ruinous in the early thirties.
Tariffs should be further reduced, not raised.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. A. Buchanan: Honourable senators, I am not rising to establish a monopoly
in this debate on the part of the senators
from Alberta. I had not intended to say
anything at all, because I felt I could not
contribute much to what had already been
said. However, the debate has widened so
much that it has left plenty of room for me
to enter and express some opinions.
Before I deal with one or two matters
which have already been mentioned in the
debate-matters which I felt were not
properly within the bounds of the resolution
-I should like to say that during the early
part of my long period in public life there
was more talk about trade, the expansion of
markets and the lowering of tariffs than
there is today. As a matter of fact, I would
not have been in public life had I not been
an advocate of the expansion of markets and
the lowering of tariffs. In 1911 I came to
the House of Commons from Western Canada
as a supporter of the reciprocity treaty,
which unfortunately was not adopted.
In later years it has seemed to me that
even our friends in the West are not thinking so much as they used to think about the
lowering of tariffs and enlarging of markets,
but are more concerned about approaching
the government for subsidies and quotasthings that have no relation to what was
asked for years ago.
The other day I was rather happy to read
in one of the Ottawa papers an article in
which a great industrialist advocated free
trade. This will interest my friend from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler), who made an
observation on free trade during the course
of this debate. Henry Ford II, a not-toodistant neighbour of my friend, came out
openly in favour of free trade throughout the
world. When I read the article I began to
think that this discussion which started in
the Senate of Canada was having some
influence outside the Senate itself. At the
same time I wondered if Henry Ford II, in
his advocacy of free trade, would be any more
successful than his grandfather was in 1915
in the attempt to have the soldiers of World
War I out of the trenches before Christmas.

SENATE

I am in sympathy with the views of Henry
Ford II. In fact, I feel that in the great
industrial city of Detroit there is more comnmon sense than in all the other cities of the
United States. The Detroit Chamber of Commerce, which must be a very influential
organization expressed itself along somewhat
the same lines as Mr. Ford did, though it
probably did not go quite so far. The chamber
showed that it was at least sympathetic to the
reduction of tariffs, by expressing the opinion
that the United States could not expect to
prosper unless it opened its markets to other
nations of the world, and that it could do so
only by reducing tariffs. That view from one
of the greatest, if not the greatest, industrial
city in the United States has been repeated in
statements which have come from other
influential sources in that country.
We have heard also from important commercial and industrial organizations in Canada
which, though perhaps not advocating free
trade, have at least expressed approval of
the idea that there must be a lowering of
tariffs if our trade is to expand.
At the outset of my remarks I said that
I did not feel I could add anything to the
discussion on the resolution itself. I can,
however, say that I am in favour of the purpose of the resolution: to have a committee
of the Senate inquire into questions of international trade, and to ascertain if anything
can be done towards achieving the aims of
NATO with respect to economic measures.
The Senate has, I think, through the years
established itself as a body fully competent
to carry on investigations into matters of
great public importance.
As I said earlier, the debate has broadened
out a good deal. I have been brought into it
because I was mentioned yesterday by the
senator from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) as having been helpful in promoting
a certain industry.
That industry was
described by my friend from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) as a small one, and it was also
referred to as being connected with a pressure
group. Now, those of us who have been in
public life know that there are pressure
groups and what are called hold-up groups. A
hold-up group is one that comes to you and
says, "If you don't do this or that, we will
throw you out of parliament." But when I
recall the representations made by tobacco
growers, by the fishermen of the Maritimes,
the lumbermen of British Columbia, the grain
trade of Winnipeg, or even the newspaper
publishers of Canada, I would not describe
these people as "pressure groups." If something is proposed for legislative enactment
at Ottawa, or something is proposed which
these people believe will interfere with their

interests, they make representations to the
government. You can call them "pressure
groupz" "r vhatever yni like. Action of
this kind cannot be avoided. It is proper
for thern to express their views.
Let me say this as to the sugar beet
industry in Canada. I have not departed from
my views in regard to freer trade and lower
tariffs, but I know that the industry was
established with assistance from the federal
government. It is not the only industry which
benefited in this way. The irrigated lands
in the area where the industry operates
were brought into being with grants from
the federal and the provincial governments.
Hon. Mr. Horner: During wartime.
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: For long years it has
been hammered into us by people from
Eastern Canada that the West must get out
of one-crop farming, get away from exclusive
wheat-growing and into diversified farming.
To succeed on an irrigated farm, diversification is essential. You cannot make money by
growing only wheat or barley or oats. Consequently, farmers on irrigated land went into
the raising of sugar beets. It is not a small
industry: in the extreme southern part of
Alberta, where I live, it affects a great many
growers, and as the years go on it will affect
more. Within a radius of twenty-five miles
of Lethbridge are three sugar factories,
representing an investment in buildings and
plant of over $10,000,000; and employment is
given-though I confess it is only seasonal-to
a large number of people. Production is on
an impressive scale: these factories are capable of processing half a million tons of beets
each year, or, in terms of sugar, 150 million
pounds.
Naturally, growers of sugar beet are concerned when something happens which seems
likely to endanger their livelihood. I do not
think the danger is as great as they believe,
but they fear the consequences and therefore
make representations to the federal government. They cannot be termed a pressure
group: I do not for a moment believe their
attitude is, "If you don't do what we want,
we will defeat you." The course which has
been followed politically in that area could
not possibly defeat the federal government,
because those people elect to the House of
Commons a rump group which have no
influence at all down here.
At the present time beets are being raised
by some two thousand individual farmers.
The phenomenal growth of my own city
is based 75 per cent on the expansion of the
sugar beet and the canning industries, as
well as on anticipation that with the extension of irrigation into other parts of the

FEBRUARY 19, 1953
district more industries will be established
and farming will become even more diversified.
Speaking of industries, I might point out
we have been told many times that our agriculture should be diversified, and of course
that follows from irrigation. We are also
told, "You must get industry into Western
Canada: you must have a home market".
Well, there are more industries in the West
than any of us ever imagined would be
established there, and they are expanding.
Look at what happened in northern Alberta
with the development of gas production. We
are becoming industrialized; and whether I
personally like it or not, it must be assumed
that with industrialization there will be
increasing clamour for protection. That is the
history of what happened with industrialization in Eastern Canada. But I believe there
is more good sense on this subject among
the industrialists of the East than there was
many years ago.
As regards pressure groups, I will recall
for · he benefit of my honourable friend from
t
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) an incident
affecting an organization with which he was
at one time connected.
The year 1919-in the period when I was
a member of the other house and the late
Martin Burrell was Minister of Agriculturewas a very dry year in Western Canada. There
was not on the plains enough food for livestock, and people wrote, telegraphed and came
to see me to urge that the duty should be
removed from, among other products, alfalfa
grown in Oregon and Washington, to enable
the growers to carry their stock through the
winter. My good friend Burrell thought it
was the proper thing to do, and he had it
done. The livestock men of southern Alberta
got the feed they needed, and all was fine.
But not long afterward-perhaps the following year-lots of feed was grown in Southern
Alberta on the prairies and on the irrigated
farms. Thereupon a deputation from a
United Farmers of Alberta local-I can speak
of it now, because the organization is practically dead, though in those days it was
mighty influential-called upon me, and I
listened to everything they had to say. They
produced resolutions comprising what was
called the Council of Agriculture platform,
and sweeping demands were made for the
extension of markets and the lowering of
tariffs. For one thing, they wanted to get
the instruments of production as cheaply as
they could and, therefore, they said, the
tariff had to be reduced. I said: "Gentlemen,
I am in sympathy with that proposal. I have
been supporting it at Ottawa for some time:
you have no need to bring it to me." They
68112-204

said they knew that. But then they presented
another resolution from the same local, asking
me to make representations to the federal
government to restore the duty on alfalfa and
certain other feed products, from which it
had been removed in 1919. I said: "Gentlemen, you began by asking me to do one
thing, and now you expect me to do the
opposite. Which do you really want? I will
be contradicting myself if I support the first
and support also the second, because you
first demanded less tariff protection, and then
you wanted it to be restored so that your
alfalfa should not suffer from competition".
Well, we meet that sort of thing once in a
while. It does not come from a pressure
group, but from a group that does not look
at both sides of the question, that does not
realize that what it is saying on the one
hand disagrees with what it is saying on the
other.
I just wanted to remove any impression that
there is any pressure group connected with a
certain industry in Alberta.
The people
behind this industry are looking after their
own interests, and I cannot do anything for
them except to present their case to this body.
I am not saying they are absolutely right, but
I do say they are not a pressure group, in
the sense that they are not holding a gun to
anybody's head.
Honourable senators, in conclusion may I
say that the change which has taken place in
the area in which I have lived for the past
forty-seven years, that is Southern Alberta,
has been so great that I am amazed at what
has happened. Besides our sugar beet factories we have a thriving canning-factory
industry, and during the last war some of our
canned goods were shipped to Ontario where
they - came into competition with Ontario
canned goods. This great transformation in
the extreme part of Southern Alberta has
resulted from our splendid irrigation system
and our ideal climate. If our canning industry
ever feels that its interests are being jeopardized by something which is taking place
elsewhere in Canada, I suppose the people
behind the industry will cry out: "Come and
save us. Come and do something for us."
Should we then consider them to be a pressure group?
As I said at the outset, I am in sympathy
with the resolution introduced by the honourable gentleman from Southern New Brunswick (Hon. Mr. McLean), for I am in favour
of anything that will help to expand our
trade. I often remind the people back home
that Canada cannot expand her trade unless
she buys goods from other nations of the
world. In other words, you cannot export if

SENATE

you are not willing to import. This policy,
however, results in competition from which
you would not otherwise surter. I ani glad
to see in my later years that I have the support of Henry Ford and the Detroit Chamber
of Commerce, and that some people of the
world are finally getting some sense as to the
best means of enlarging our markets and
expanding trade.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Honourable senators,
on behalf of the honourable gentleman from
Charlotte (Hon. Mr. Doone), I move the
adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.
CANADIAN CITIZENSHIP BILL
ANSWER TO INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
may I have your indulgence in order to clarify
an answer made to a question asked me during the course of my explanation of Bill Q-5,
an Act to amend the Canadian Citizenship

Act? I was asked how long a British subject
would be required to live in Canada before
The honourte
oi' in ourelections
l
able gentleman from Bruce (Hon. Mr. Stambaugh) kindly supplied the answer-one year.
However, there seemed to be some confusion
at the time, and I wish now to make the
record clear. I have before me the Canada
Elections Act, which sets out the oath required
to be taken by a British subject, under certain circumstances, at a general election. It
reads:
You swear that you are a British subject of the
full age of 21 years, and that you have ordinarily
resided in Canada for the year immediately preceding the . . .

Then the date is to be filled in, the day of
the issue of the writ of election. That is the
authority. So now we know without doubt
that a British subject may vote in Canada
after he has been in this country for one
year.
The Senate adjourned until Monday, February 23, at 8 p.m.

CANADIAN VESSEL CONSTRUCTION
ASSISTANCE BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. Lambert moved the third reading
of Bill 19, an Act to amend the Canadian
Vessel Construction Assistance Act.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
PRIVATE BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. Turgeon (for Hon. Mrs. Wilson)
moved the third reading of Bill Y-3, an Act
respecting a certain patent and patent application of Florence F. Loudon.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
intend to vote for this bill, because I think
it is absolutely justified, but I want to make
some comments about the administration of
the Patent department. I think the service
given by this department is absolutely rotten.
The delays involved are terrible. Sometimes
when patent lawyers file an application it is
a month, three months or even a year and a
half before the department takes any action.
There was a delay of a year and a half in the
case that gave rise to the bill before us.
The patent attorney who was first engaged
by the applicant had gone out of business
before an answer came back from the department. In the meantime the applicant, unaware
of the true situation, started manufacturing
her invention. Finally she had to engage
another patent attorney to clear the matter up.
Most practising lawyers who have a real
understanding and appreciation of patent law
always advise any inventor who consults them
to see a qualified patent attorney. Patent law
is very involved, often having a great deal
to do with engineering matters, and in many
cases an engineer has to be consulted. An
attorney must pass special examinations
before being allowed to practice patent law.
It is a type of work about which there is a
good deal of speculation, and often it is found
that a patent has already been granted on
the idea being put forth by an applicant.
Patent attorneys are a very important professional class in Canada, particularly in these
times.
In Winnipeg there is a very good patent
attorney, to whom I mentioned during our

last recess that this bill would be coming
before us. I asked him what was causing
the delays in the Patent department. He said
that the department was apparently understaffed, and that not many people seemed
to realize the importance of patent work. I
think the staff of such an important department should be increased, particularly in the
present period of industrial development. I
do not know what minister this department
comes under, and in any event I am not
blaming the minister. My thought is that
the general set-up should be reorganized and
made to operate more efficiently.
I am sorry that the leader of the government
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) is not in his place, for
if he were I would urge him to have some
inquiry made into the administration of the
Patent department, to see if it could not be
made to operate more efficiently. In committee a certain official-I think it was the
Commissioner of Patents-admitted to me that
the department was understaffed. He did not
blame the government for this, but he said he
was endeavouring to get personnel to fill
vacancies. Now, if the salaries are too low to
attract men to the department then they ought
to be raised. There is no reason why any
person should encounter difficulty in having
his inventions patented.
Honourable members, I have made these
remarks in a spirit of good will, with a view
to bringing about an improvement in the
service rendered by this department of the
government.
Hon. J. H. King: Honourable senators, I
should like to say a few words in answer to
the observations of the honourable leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig).
I was in committee the other morning
when this bill was considered. An officer of
the department was present and indicated the
difficulties which had been experienced in
this particular case. To be a patent attorney
a person does not have to be a lawyer, but
may qualify simply by passing an examination. Unfortunately, the first patent attorney
engaged in this case was a crook, and did not

I am also concerned regarding the point
raised with respect td staff insufficiency. It
is a matter which can be rectified so easily.
If recurring problems are being created on
this score, the solution lies in the collective
thinking of the Committee on Internal
Economy.
After all, this is a business
establishment where the public must be
served, and served in an effective manner. It
should, therefore, be staffed to meet peak
loads of committee activity and should not
be hampered in supplying the services
expected of it.
Time with its forward
impulses will demand greater considerations
on many kindred problems, and our thinking
in respect to them should be geared to meet
the growing need of an ever-expanding public
interest.
Personally, I have no complaint. To the
committee with which I am connected every
facility has been accorded and every courtesy extended, but I know the matter is
causing a general concern and I express my
views in relation to its broader aspects.
Having made this diplomatic approach, I
will proceed to the subject-matter of the
debate. I may safely do so without violence
to my previous proposition, as I am not a
member of the proposed committee of
investigation.
The historical background of the resolution
before the Senate may be found in the
economie clauses of the Atlantic Charter.
For clarity, these may be quoted as follow:
Clause Four. They (i.e. the United States and
Great Britain) will endeavour with due respect
for their existing obligations to further the enjoyment of all States, great or small, victor or vanquished, of access on equal terms to the trade, and
to the raw materials of the world which are needed
for their economic security.
Clause Five. They desire to bring about the
fullest collaboration between ail nations in the
economic field with the object of securing for all,
improved
labour standards,
economic
adjustment and social security.

We seem to have heard that expression before with agonizing disgust and disfavour.
Has it become less reprehensible, or have
our mental processes been bruted by war and
our ethies deadened by the soothing influences of a temporary but an increased prosperity?
From arguments which appear in the
records, it would seem that a dim view is
held in some quarters of any widening of the
horizon. However, there is a more cheering
forecast from other sources. Under date of
February 21 of the current year, the Financial
Post has this to say under the captions "The
Nation's Business" and "We Have Huge Stake
in this Argument". I quote as follows:
A movement is getting under way in the United
States that could be of immense significance to
Canada.
This is a frontal attack by powerful
American interests on excessive U.S. tariffs and
other strangling trade restrictions.
The drive is not supported by just a handful
of American internationalists or a minority political group. Spearheaded by the potent Detroit
Board of Commerce, it gets both its leadership
and main backing from the great industrial centres
of the north and east, an area which no administration at Washington can afford to ignore for
long.
Carrying the campaign to the Chicago Trade
Conference this week, John S. Coleman, head of
the Burroughs Adding Machine Co., and president
of the Detroit Board of Commerce made this blunt
statement:
"Some progress has been made in revising the
American tariff: But we must not exaggerate the
effect of those reductions: Today, there are more
than 3,600 duties still in effect. Of these, some
492 exceed 50 per cent ad valorem; several hundred are 25 per cent ad valorem or more. Many
rates, such as those on coal tar dyes are virtually
prohibitive. It is astonishing to discover that we
have duties on valuable raw materials available
not at all or in Insufficient quantities in the
United States."
To another Chicago gathering Henry Ford II
came out even more emphatically for slashing U.S.
trade barriers. He would progressively eliminate
tariffs, drop quotas and the Buy American Act,
and really simplify customs procedures. Said Ford:
"We accuse our foreign neighbours of lacking the
kind of spirit that has made American industry
great. We implore them to follow our example
and get off our backs. Let us practise what we
preach. Let's give our friends a fair crack at the

outsiders we have the greatest stake, both actual
and potential, in the U.S.A. market.

Having read with some degree of satisfaction this move for remedial measures, we
come to the question as to what part Canada
is going to play in supporting this constructive thinking, and in particular what special
and intimate aid she, herself, can bring to
the aims of economic solution.
There is no doubt that Canada wishes to
trade with the commonwealth. The seaboard
provinces have a special interest in such a
prospect. The very lifeblood of their economy
is to a large extent dependent upon marineborne traffic. Geography has made this one
of the fundamental postulates of their trading
operations. All that is needed is a selling and
purchasing medium for the interchange of
goods and services.
This brings us in natural sequence to the
mooted question of "convertibility". It is
a word which I do not choose to employ. It
is undoubtedly correct as many economists
use it. To me, it suggests world recognition
of some standard, such as gold, whereas
today trading relations, based on the principle of supply and demand, are weighed
in the scale of trade balances. I would
prefer the word "exchangeability", or, to
be concrete, the expression "support of
sterling". This raises one of the real issues,
and, being raised, may I advise that I see
no insurmountable obstacles in sterling
support by accumulating a moderate amount
of that currency in our central reserve.
Such a reserve would give a purchasing
power in all parts of the commonwealth,
both now and in the future. It would set
an example to all NATO members.
It
would point out, especially to the United
States, that we, the Canadian people, have
confidence not only in the pound but in the
British character and its high standard of
financial morality. It would be a good will
gesture ýto other parts of the commonwealth
who are in the sterling pool: South Africa,
Australia, New Zealand and the West Indies,
all temporarily short of dollars. That confidence in our sister nations would prejudice
no long term or forward-looking policy. The
investment of one or two hundred million
dollars would, by today's monetary standards, be a small price to pay towards
empire restoration, and restoration is on the
way. Make no mistake about that. In a very
few years the growth of these parts of the
commonwealth is going to be so great that

we shall look back and wonder why we ever
doubted their future. This is substantiated
Ly l

weight

ofi

It is not the first time that the pound has
sold at a substantial discount.
In the
thirties of dismal memory the British,
Australian and New Zealand pounds were
separately rated, at different figures in relation to parity. In fact, the Australian pound
was set at a government level to restrict
imports, and yet was the first currency in
the world, with the exception of that of
Portugal, to display a full recovery. Admittedly, the pieces have changed position on
the play-board of time, but nevertheless in
the period of review there were, for all
of us, dark days ahead, and in immediate
contemplation. In 1937 Australia was holding night drills in fearful anticipation of a
India and the Straits
Japanese invasion.
Settlements were stock piling against the
possibilities of wartime ventures. In view,
therefore, of past experience, there is nothing
novel in the way of nervous apprehensions.
The world is much the same in every age,
and its recovery is based upon its resources
of men and minds, as well as upon its markets and materials.
The mechanics of support would be a vital
feature. I would presume it might be
effectively operated by the Bank of Canada
buying for reserve a moderate amount of
sterling, to be held along with its other
foreign currencies. At the moment, the central bank's reserves are a billion and a half
in terms of dollars. The amount suggested for
sterling, therefore, would be only a small
fraction of the total. It need not be subject
to violent fluctuations. Our national central
reserve may be held to be drawn upon in
times of crises or economic stress. It could
be made remote from day-to-day transactions.
In this respect it would differ in character
from a personal bank account. On the other
hand, sterling could be used if required or
feasible, and on this point let us not bemuse
our thinking. It would not, as stated by the
honourable senator from St. John's West
(Hon. Mr. Pratt), have to be paid for by loans
or taxes. Let us avoid these verbal fallacies.
They promote dangerous prohibitions. The
practical aspects of sterling support lie in
its immediate utilization.
The experience of other countries attests
to the truth of this feature. Russia used the
sterling it received on balance from the
United Kingdom, and transferred it to Australia, where it was expended to purchase
wool for army purposes. The ascending prices
of high-grade wool at the time in Canadian
and American markets were a direct result
of this financial transfer. In addition, Russia

FEBRUARY 23, 1953
used sterling to buy tin in the Malayas. In
Canada also many outlets would developone canning plant is particularly in mind as
wishing to buy fruit in Australia with available sterling. There need be no freezing, as
suggested again by the honourable senator
from St. John's West. Sterling could be made
expendable anywhere in the commonwealth
for goods and services, and in the ordinary
orthodox methods of trade. That would be
part of the practicability of sterling support.
Business houses wishing to secure or sell
sterling would have a shopping centre. If the
quota of the central reserve was reduced by
sales, it could be brought up to the authorization point by purchases. If sterling were
required it could sell for trading accommodation.
On the practical side, moreover, for official
purposes, sterling would be a recognized -currency. It would be protected from fluctuation;
a measure of support which for income tax
purposes might prove of inestimable value
in the exigencies of export and import
trading.
The honourable senator for New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) stated that the
paper he held in his hand as he spoke could
be made current legal tender if people had
faith. Our whole system of exchange is based
on this principle. It depends entirely on
official recognition. If one doubts the truth of
this statement let him examine a Bank of
Canada bill, if he is fortunate enough to find
one in his pocket. I am not a Central Canada
industrialist or a Western farmer. The bill I
find in my pocket is a one-dollar bill. On it
there is the following certificate: "Bank of
Canada will pay to the bearer on demand
One Dollar". What does it mean? If he goes
into the Bank of Canada and makes that
demand, the bank will pass him a piece of
paper on which the identical words will
appear: "Bank of Canada will pay to the
bearer on demand One Dollar". If he goes
back and tenders the second bill, he will be
given a third script in like tenor. It resolves
itself into the proposition that, for trading
purposes, merchants must depend upon a
recognized currency. It is my further belief
that if sterling is recognized as a trading unit
along the lines suggested, it will eventually
lead to the full freedom of the pound. This
means that sterling will become freely
exchangeable for any other currency, not
excluding dollars.
May I revert to the question of freezing
and payment in loans and taxes, raised by
the honourable senator from St. John's West?
Contrary to many internal devices of governmental operation, the costs of sterling support
would be in clerical features only. This

should prove no shock to the public conscience. We have withstood greater impacts
without visible disturbance. Wheat, milk,
butter and other commodities have been sustained in competitive positions through official intervention at government level. Loans
and taxes are presently supporting huge
stock piles of pork and their sale to the
Canadian public. The cost for the past fiscal
year on this support alone, according to
budget figures, was $47 million. What the
policy has done in restricted sales of normally
competitive lines must be left to conjecture.
I do not know general thinking on this
issue, but it seems axiomatic to me that
instead of subsidizing over-production and
under-consumption, the interests of Canada
would be best served by exportation of such
commodities to commonwealth countrieswhich need the products-and acceptance of
payment in expendable sterling.
Support could also be given to the sterling
bloc through repatriation of our internal
assets. The control of many of these still
remains in Europe. The underlying factor
was our own past shortage of sterling. Before
the first World War this country was going
ahead rapidly with its transportation systems
and other heavy industries. Capital was
needed. The latter was supplied in London
to the extent of hundreds of millions of
pounds. At the present stage of history the
situation is reversed-the United Kingdom is
short of dollars-so that any securities purchased on the London Stock Exchange at
market prices would provide a wide measure
of relief in Britain's dollar shortage.
In this connection, it is worthy of comment
that the United States does not hesitate to
buy such securities, or make loans upon them.
That the yardstick of our transportation
charges may, through the latter accommodation, be transferred from London to New
York is one of the thought-engaging problems
of Canada's future.
I do not know the further answers as to
currency recognition, but modern economists
have increasingly contended that, given sufficient confidence in the honesty and capacity
of the issuing authority, a world monetary
system could be evolved which, by expansion
and contraction to meet world needs, would
preserve economic stability. Let those who
know study this problem; let us hear their
arguments, not prejudiced by preconceived
fixations, and without local or national bias.
The total answer is not simple. No grave
or intricate problem is subject to easy solution. But the resolution offers a form of
study and a new approach where old and
popularly-called orthodox methods, as far as

SENATE
world peace and reconstruction are concerned,
have Droved to be dismal failures.
In making these observations, I have not
closed my mind to the incidents which go
into trade relations, supply and demand, trade
balance, production and distribution. I agree
whole-heartedly with the statement of the
honourable senator from Queen's-Lunenburg
(Hon. Mr. Kinley) that the United States has
kept to the forefront of world trade because
of economic strength, scientific progress and
wonderful techniques for mass production. I
am ware that quantity and quality production
are the great factors of trade. I am also
convinced that the high standards of democratic freedoms may lack the productive
capacity of communistic policies of economic
enslavement. But I am likewise aware that
we are dedicated to the principle that those
standards must be kept, and that those freedoms must be maintained. I am hopeful,
therefore, that a new spirit-the spirit of
co-operation-stirred by a common danger
and a common hope may free the world from
short-sighted irresponsible selfishness and
promote, on a broad universal scale, a social
betterment, a lasting recovery and a prosperity
firmly based on the soundest economic
foundations.
In agreeing with the honourable senator
from Queen's-Lunenburg in respect to the
trading position of the United States, I do
not concede his further proposition that the
Almighty does not noticeably interfere in
matters of trade. On the contrary, I believe
the Almighty very noticeably appears in ail
our trading aspects. The Almighty places the
elements in the soil. He supplies the means
to promote growth or secure production. He
gives to man the strength and means of
harvesting. He supplies the outlets for distribution. And, giving ail these requisites, He
undoubtedly expects that man will exericise
his God-given sense to utilize ail phases that
enter into trading operations for the benefit
and the betterment of his fellowmen.
We must pursue this problem also from
the viewpoint of self-preservation. Let us
examine the facts. There is no doubt that
Great Britain has strained her resources
through the prosecution of her war efforts,
and to some degree bas suffered a collapse of
the economic foundation upon which her
former greatness was based. Nevertheless,
her future is not unassured. The belief is
still current that Britain, though old in years,
is young in spirit, with that latent vigour
which bas raised her superior to similar
adversities in the past.
Whether this proposition will have an early
or delayed realization is yet undisclosed. But
one thing is crystal clear in the appraisal of

human events. Britain is needed in the
scheme of things for the maintenance of world
her leadership in world répeace ad fr
establishment. Her influence is still great, and
her counsel the qualified voice of tested
experience. Her strategic position in world
defence has been proven in two wars and
will yet display tenacious qualities of
resistance.
Many prate of liberty and voice philosophic
maxims from the cracker-barrel of parochial
interest. Let us not fall into this restricted
category. Let us rather speak in terms of
freedom from the wide rostrum of world
necessities and human betterment.
Make no mistake about it. We need not
only England in the defence program. We
need other commonwealth and friendly nations. This is no time to turn pictures to the
wall, or to place memories in attic storage.
The orderly conduct of human affairs, from
the standpoint of economic security, must
engage our searching and profound attention.
We, who know the story, should subscribe
to this doctrine. We have the record of past
errors and misguided concepts. Their direct
and fatal consequences lie in the world
tragedy of the past decade, and could find
repetition through revolutionary violence
again making use of selected areas of economic misery.
The danger of the hour is that Communist
forces may utilize the same media to
bring less privileged states under the iron
wing of totalitarian exploitation. Let our
mental vision be clear on this point. May
we be able to see in the clear light of approximate peace as we were able to see in the dark
days of confusion and conflict.
Two alternatives have been tentatively but
unconvincingly suggested for Britain's economic recovery. In the British House of
Commons on April 21, 1944, Mr. Churchill
explained that he had inserted the expression
"with respect to their existing obligations"
in the economic clauses referred to as limiting words, for the express purpose of retaining in the British house and in the dominion
parliaments the fullest possible rights and
principles over the question of imperial preference. The other alternative is the creation
of a sterling or soft currency bloc with economic links of trade, shipping and finance,
sufficient in strength and solidarity to compete with unrestricted trade within the
United States under a single tariff, and the
rigid collectivism of the Soviet system. Both
are of questionable value. The first is predicated on words vague in meaning, subject
to variable interpretation leading to unknown

FEBRUARY 23. 1953
ends and implications. The second is a longterm undertaking leading down many byroads and conditioned on too many variants
in national temperments and policies.
For this reason, I like the thought of the
honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) regarding co-operation-the gearing of our
economic progress to our progress in common
defence. It has always been a safe and a
sane directive, and always complaints have
been lodged, and with justice, against nonadherence to such a procedure. Over a century ago Lord Elgin, speaking on behalf of
Canada and diversions of trade to the American Union, complained that "England was
kinder to the children who deserted her than
to those who remained faithful". Protests
were lodged prior to the last supreme conflirt against shipments of scrap metal to
Japan from Canadian and American ports by
nomadic internationalists. Recent incidents
might be cited of enemy trading in exhausting
quantity and of deadly import. Surely we
have learned from the past. Surely history
has taught us a salutary lesson. Let us rather
support in peace those who support us in
times of national conflict and trial.
If collaboration in this regard and the
gearing of our economic forces to our foreign
policy and system of defence must be paid
for in loans and taxes, as suggested by an
honourable senator, we may place on the
credit side of the ledger the lives of Canadian youth in this and succeeding generations.
In the cause of justice, in the cause of
freedom, towards the payment of debts long
contracted and long over-due, towards the
causes of mutual defence, including our own
self-interest and self-preservation, let us have
a forthright policy, one which we need not

excuse nor defend against criticism, mental or
spoken, one of which we may not be secretly
ashamed, one of which we may be justly
proud.
May we, indeed, with every thought bent
towards the common good observe with
united attention the comments of the honourable the leader of this chamber on the address
in reply to the Speech from the Throne. On
that occasion he said in part as follows:
What the NATO countries need on the part of

must be strong, positive, and such as is likely to
strike the imagination of free people everywhere.

Yes, let it be strong. Let it be positive, Let
it be in the cause of freedom. May the democratic countries of the world band together
in economir and military defence against the
inimical forces of economic and military
envelopment.
In this respect and to this end may we
return to "convertibility". May we each convert the inspiring words of the poet Blake
to our own time and circumstances in the
following terms and meter:
I will not cease from mental fight,
Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand,
Till we have built Security
In England's green and pleasant land.

On this the future of mankind may reasonably depend.

MOTION-DEBATE

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
McLean that the Standing Committee on
Canadian Trade Relations be empowered to
inquire into and report upon the development
of trade between countries signatory to the
North Atlantic Treaty, and with other countries of the free world.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
having listened to some very good speeches
during this debate, it is with some fear-but
not exactly trembling-that I rise to offer
my observations on this important subject.
I welcome the opportunity to add my contri-

FEBRUARY 24, 1953
bution to what has been said, and I believe
many will agree with my views.
As to the matter of trade generally, I have
been hearing about it all my life. This
reminds me of what Mark Twain is reported
to have said about the weather: "Everybody
talks about the weather but nobody does anything about it."
It seems to me that if we are going to succeed in the matter of world trade we must
face the hard facts and realities. We must get
the co-operation of the whole world; in particular, we should seek the co-operation of
labour throughout the world.
In this so-called political democracy of ours
we find that manufacturers of automobiles,
and textiles, for instance, have great difficulty
in getting their goods through the tariff barriers. There seems to be, at the political
level, a great deal of fear of putting some
men out of work here or there.
The honourable senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar), in his remarks about
farmers, referred to some who made representations to the government as "pressure
groups." The honourable senator from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan) made a very
sensible ýreply in support of the sugar beet
growers. It should be pointed out that during the war years farmers in the Lethbridge
area, and in Ontario and Quebec as well,
were encouraged by the government to grow
sugar beets. Today, as a consequence, a great
many farmers are producing sugar beets. Not
only does this crop produce fine sugar, but
the by-products from it make one of the best
feeds for fattening cattle. While visiting
France and Belgium last fall I was most
interested to note the enormous quantity of
sugar beets being produced over there, and
the careful way in which the tops were being
carted off to feed livestock.
Why is it our farmers are continually being
victimized? Why are they held up to public
ridicule and charged with refusing to cooperate? The farmers of western Canada are
most anxious to sell their beef to the United
States and we hope that by March 1 there
will be some improvement in the situation.
I would remind honourable senators of the
failure on the part of our government to take
proper action in the days when the United
States barred the entry of beef from Mexico
because of the foot-and-mouth disease and
the American people were eager to get Canadian meat. The price of beef in the United
States rose from 35 cents a pound to 40 cents,
while in Canada it dropped to one-third or
one-quarter of that; yet we were prevented
from shipping our beef to the United States
not by a tariff, but by an embargo. Admission of Canadian beef to the American
market at that time would have helped to
reduce living costs in the United States and

been of very considerable benefit to the
western farmer. Politically speaking, the
purpose behind the lack of action on the part
of the government was to keep living costs
in eastern Canada down, at the expense of
the western farmer.
Also, the farmers of the West were victimized to the extent of $75 million during the
war when they were required to sell wheat
for domestic consumption at prices lower
than the world price.
Surely there is no justification for accusing some sections of our farmers and stockraisers of being pressure groups just because
they want a living wage for those who work
in that industry. A short time ago shirts
made in Japan were to be had at five for a
dollar; running shoes, for twenty cents a
pair; ships, for far less than it costs to build
them in this country. But no; the factory
workers live together in thousands and are
organized, and the government is fearful of
unemployment, so we farmers must pay protected prices for our goods. Manufacturers
of automobiles persuaded the government to
put a tariff on imports, and recently three
thousand English motor cars were shipped
back to Britain. What a spectacle! A trainload of cement from England is sitting at
Churchill. Canadian cement companies protest
that it is not required, that domestic producers can supply all demands; but a dealer
who handles some of this product tells me
that, so far from this being the case, his
firm could not get cement in Canada after
they had had it on order for months. Yet
although we could obtain cement from England, which buys many products from us,
this necessary import is objected to.
Today world affairs are in a serious condition, and I commend the honourable senator who moved the resolution for bringing
it before us. The gravity of the situation is
reflected in his suggestion that a committee
consider and report on how. . . any project for developing economic collaboration between the countries which are signatories of the North Atlantic Treaty might have
the same degree of permanence that is contemplated in the twenty-year military obligation under
article 5 of the treaty whereby 'The parties agree
that an armed attack against one or more of them
in Europe or North America shall be considered an
attack against them all".

Perhaps a graver issue has never come
before us in a discussion of this kind.
In the course of the debate the honourable
senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) made a very good speech, which, as
far as I am concerned, was spoilt when he
got his dates wrong as to the relationship
of the tariff to the world depression. The
depression which struck Canada, in common
with almost the whole world, began in 1929.
The Bennett government was not elected

Crerar) went as far back as 1911. I took
the trouble to go to the parliamentary library
to get a copy of the Arnerican tnriff schedules
of the so-called reciprocal trade agreement
of 1911. The library was unable to provide
me with a copy of the Canadian tariff
schedules. In reading over the agreement I
noticed a provision to the effect that notwithstanding any arrangement entered into,
the agreement could be revoked at any time.
And even under the agreement there was still
to be a duty of 331 per cent on some classes
of Canadian goods, 17 per cent on others
and so on. To speak of this agreement as
being a straight reciprocal deal is nothing
short of ridiculous.
Great things were supposed to come out
of the recent trade agreements reached at
Geneva, but the ink was scarcely dry on
them before pressure groups in the United
States demanded that the government of
that country prohibit the importation of Canadian cheese. This action was taken notwithstanding that it was contra:ry to what had
been agreed to at Geneva. Similar action
was taken with regard to powdered milk and
certain other Canadian products which are
prohibited entry into the United States.
The whole idea that tariffs had anything to
do with causing the war or that Canada had
anything to do with other countries raising
their tariffs is ridiculous on the face of it.
The markets of the world were being closed
to us and, in order to survive, Canada had
to retaliate and make its own arrangements.
What about the commonwealth agreement
which was made in the thirties? I may say
that not the least of the Liberals, Chief
Justice Ilsley, supported that agreement.
What can we possibly do to improve our
trade situation? It certainly would be a
splendid thing if all peoples everywhere
could rid themselves of their selfishness and
greed.
At this point I should like to quote an
editorial by Bruce Hutchison which appeared
in last night's edition of the Ottawa Citizen.
It reads:

the actions of the late Viscount Bennett,
every good Canadian should get down on
his knees and thank his Maker that we had
in power at that time a man of Bennett's
type.
Then we heard the honourable senator
from Calgary (Hon. Mr. Ross) assuming that
the change of tariffs was begun in the early
thirties and was the cause of the second
world war.
Hon. Mr. Ross: May I point out to the
honourable member that on election day,
1930, the price of wheat was 93, cents
per bushel. Under the Liberal government
that might seem like a depression price, but
under the following Conservative government it sank much lower.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Yes, but let me tell my
honourable friend, from personal experience,
what was happening at the same time in the
wealthy United States of America. At the
time to which the honourable senator refers
I happened to visit the great corn state of
Iowa. All the cribs were filled with lovely
corn; the fine lawns were stacked twenty
feet high with corn; great quantities
remained in the fields; yet it could not be
sold for the price of husking it. I remarked,
"Surely somebody is buying this corn". The
answer I got was "A few feeders are buying
it at 7 cents a bushel". I said, "Can you
not draw it to the elevator and get cash
for it?" No, I was told, you could not. When
wheat fell to about the price the honourable
senator mentioned I had a very practical
experience as the result of neglecting to
attend to my own business. In that particular
year the pool operated on a monthly basis.
I did not realize this until I shipped
eleven carloads of the best wheat that ever
grew, and got 32 cents a bushel for it. Had
I held it on the basis of the yearly pool,
and kept it at home, I would have got 65
and 70 cents a bushel that same year at the
elevator.

what happened in 1907.
In a quiet voice this man who has all the facts
Hon. Mr. Horner: Well, we have been going at his fingertips remarked that four things had
back a long way in this debate. The hon- happened to advance the world in recent times.
First, if man's scientific advancement up to the
ourable gentleman from Churchill (Hon. Mr. last century were taken as representing one inch,

FEBRUARY 24, 1953
the advance since then would cover about a hundred yards. This is the pace we are going.
Secondly, every year the world's population is
growing at the rate of 20 millions-or 55,000 every
day-and that rate of increase is constantly rising.
Malthus, who used to preach that population was
outgrowing the world's ability to support it, bas
long been discredited. Now he seems to be right.
Third, Dr. Keenleyside observed the obvious fact
that man's intelligence and morals have lagged far
behind his techniques. He cannot yet control the
juggernaut of science he has built.
And finally, in the last six months, man has
built weapons which can extinguish his civilization,
can incinerate for example, 50 million North
Americans in a few hours.
But a still more striking thing bas occurred and,
In the end, will dominate all these other considerations. It is that man everywhere, from the western city to the jungles of Asia, now knows for the
first time in all human history that, with modern
machinery, everybody can enjoy a decent life and
everybody is determined to have it.
This was never so before our time. Throughout
all man's history on earth, up to now, poverty,
illness and misery have been inevitable and people
accepted them because they had no option. Man's
realization that he could have a decent life if
things were well managed creates the present
world revolution, of which all the wars and local
revolutions are only the outward symptoms.

Hon. Mr. Davis: May I interrupt the honourable senator to ask a question? As
reported by Mr. Hutchison, does Mr.
Keenleyside not contradict himself?
Hon. Mr. Horner: In what way?
Hon. Mr. Davis: He says that the theory
of Malthus-that population is outgrowing
the world's ability to support it-is now in
force. Then he says that because of man's
scientific advancement -the nations of the
world are today enjoying a better standard
of living.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Perhaps I did not read
the article plainly. I do not think there is
any contradiction. But I will read that part
again:
Malthus. who used to preach that population
was outgrowing the world's ability to support it,
has long been discredited. Now he seems to be
right.

I will continue reading from just before
the place where I was interrupted:
Throughout all man's history on earth, up to
now, poverty, illness and misery have been
inevitable and people accepted them because they
had no option. Man's realization that he could
have a decent life if things were well managed
created the present world revolution, of which all
the wars and local revolutions are only the outward symptoms.
These are appalling facts. They may well mean
that civilization is doomed, that we or our children may witness, in a last blinding flash, the end
of orderly life on this particular planet.
The interesting point about this speech is that
no one hearing it seemed in the least appalled.
Man has heard the warning so often that he no
longer listens. It is too familiar.
As Dr. Keenleyside observed, we have such a
spectacle in Canada as this: To assist the poorer
nations towards a decent life and to dissuade them
from communism which promises them everything,

the government of Canada this year will spend on
foreign aid through the United Nations the price of
a single bomber. On all aid, including a miserable
crust of $25 million for the Colombo Plan, Canada
will spend the cost of one destroyer.
This is lunacy of a very high order. It is just
one of many indications that western man does not
possess at the moment enough intelligence to
survive. Among other symptoms it explains why,
in the last five years, we have been steadily losing
the cold war for all our apparent local victories.
And if we go on this way assuredly we shall lose
it altogether in the end, whether defeat comes
gradually and almost invisibly or whether it
comes suddenly in one grand lethal explosion.
For the policies of western nations like Canada
governments cannot escape their responsibility but,
in this as in al other matters, they are acting
as the people want them to act. The people of
Canada, for example, are not seriously interested
in the plight of the poor and desperate peoples
who, spurred.by the false promises of communIsm,
are likely to engulf them. They would not support a government which asked them to reduce
their own living standard by one per cent in
favour of the poorer peoples.

To correct this situation I think some responsible person will have to determine just
how far we can go in the matter of boosting
wages of our workers. Labour must be taken
into our confidence, in an effort to determine
to what extent we are going to allow others
to share in the work to be done.
The last section of the article is under the
subheading "Too Stupid To Last?" It begins
by saying this:
Indeed, it is all the government can do to allow
the poor people even to sell their goods here, lest
(by a miracle of economic nonsense) they might
threaten our prosperity.

"Economic nonsense" is the proper way of
describing a system under which people are
refused the right to sell their products at a
fair price. But why single out the farmers,
and protect the manufacturers of automobiles
and textiles?
Hon. Mr. Euler: The manufacturers do not
get subsidies.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Perhaps not, but the
farmers have to pay back their subsidies;
and those who were encouraged to grow
sugar beets had to buy expensive machinery
to start their operations.
I should like to revert for a moment to the
criticism of the thirties.
Hon. Mr. Grant: You had better post us
on that point.
Hon. Mr. Horner: The march on Ottawa in
the early thirties, which the government
stopped in Regina, was as much a full-fiedged
march on the capital of this country as was
Mussolini's march on Rome.
But what
happened? Every prominent Liberal in the
country went to the aid of the marchers.

lax in handing out citizenship. There is nothing
that confuses a nation more quickly than citizens
who cannot speak the official language. The more
persons we get to sneak our language-whether
English or French-the better citizens we will
have.
Hon. Mr. Wood: What about "Scotch"?
Hon. Mr. Reid: You are talking about whisky and
about something entirely different-the word is
"Scots".

Some Hon. Senafors: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Reid: Any person with any
Scottish blood or lineage in his make-up
never uses the word "Scotch" when referring
to anyone belonging to the Scottish race.
It always seems that worthwhile contributions made by honourable senators appear in
the back pages of our newspapers, whereas
such comments as the one I made on this
occasion are displayed on the front page.
Hon. Mr. Euler: It is not unusual.

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. T. A. Crerar moved the second reading
of Bill Z-5, an Act to incorporate Canadian
Disaster Relief Fund, Incorporated.
He said: Honourable senators, in speaking
to the second reading of this bill, it might be
helpful if I made a brief reference to the
topography of the province of Manitoba, particularly in respect of its rivers.
There are in that province two main rivers:
the Red river, which has its source in
Minnesota, several hundred miles south of
Winnipeg, and draws tributaries from either
side up to the point where it empties into
Lake Winnipeg; and the Assiniboine river,
with its source in the highlands of western
Manitoba and eastern Saskatchewan.
The
history of these two rivers, going back over
a period of 130 years, is that of recurring
floods from time to time. The most serious
of those floods occurred in 1826, when there
was very little settlement on cither the Red
or Assiniboine rivers. At that time there
were a few Selkirk settlers along the Red
river between what was known as Fort
Garry, at the junction of the Assiniboine and
the Red, and Lake Winnipeg.
On the
occasion of that flood, the worst in the
recorded history of Manitoba, the waters of
the two rivers flowed over the surrounding
level country, including the whole of the Red
River Valley. Some idea of the magnitude
of the flood may be gained from the fact that
the water rose to a point of five feet in depth
at what is now the corner of Main Street and
Portage Avenue in Winnipeg. That indicates,
of course, that the flooding extended over the
surrounding country for miles on either side
of the river.
The next most serious flood was in 1852.
There was another such disaster in 1861, and
one in each of the years 1882, 1892, 1904, 1916,
and 1948. The latest was the flood of 1950,
which is the occasion for the bill now
before us.
The flood of 1950-the worst in about 90
years-was caused by one of the strange
happenings of nature. In the fall of 1949
there was a very heavy rainfall throughout
the watershed of the Red river, followed by
an exceptionally heavy fall of snow throughout the winter months. Superimposed on

that background were heavy spring rains in
the month of April. Then the warm weather
came upun fie uutry rather quickly,
nd
the snow melted so rapidly that the water
could not disappear gradually. Consequently,
the flood waters came down in full force
upon Winnipeg and the area between that city
and the international boundary. The source
of the flooding was for the most part south
of the Canadian border.
Honourable senators may recall that about
that time there was set up in the railway
committee room of the House of Commons
a map showing the flooded area between
Emerson and Winnipeg, at the height of the
flood. Briefly, it may be stated that practically that whole area was under water.
Certainly, the whole town of Morris was.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Do not forget St. Jean.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes, St. Jean was under
water too.
Indeed, the residence of my
honourable friend the genial whip on this
side of the house (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) had
four feet of water in it, much to the honourable gentleman's annoyance.
Fortunately for the city of Winnipeg, the
Assiniboine river was not in flood at the
time of the flooding of the Red river. As
honourable senators may know, the Assiniboine flows in from the west, and joins the
Red river at about the centre of the city.
Had the Assiniboine been in flood at that
time, as it was in the years 1826, 1852 and
1861, there can be no doubt whatever but that
every person in Winnipeg would have had to
be evacuated. As it was, there was a great
deal of damage and inconvenience caused.
When the magnitude of the disaster was
realized, committees were immediately set
up to deal with it. The provincial government
was actively associated with relief work. On
May 9 a committee, known as the Mayor's
Committee of the City of Winnipeg, was set
up, and two days later it was enlarged, under
the name of "The Manitoba Relief Fund Committee". Mr. H. W. Manning, Vice-President
and Managing Director of the Great West
Life Assurance Company, was appointed chairman. On May 13 there was a further enlargement, to take in representatives from the
surrounding country which was affected. An
appeal for funds was made, and it is a matter
for congratulation that the response w-as
widespread and generous.
The committee received in subscriptions
approximately $9,143,000.
The interest on
the fund amounts to $73,000. Total disbursements were $7,545,000, to which must be
added $211,000, the cost of receiving and disThese latter expenses

represent less than two and one-third per

FEBRUARY 25, 1953
cent of the amount received. The di'sbursements were limited to a certain class of relief,
including repairs and replacements, essential
clothing, household furnishings and goods;
living expenses above normal cost incurred by
those who had to be evacuated, being losses
not covered by insurance of any kind or
repaid from governmental relief moneys.
These charges, aggregating $4,096,000, constituted by far the greater item. In addition,
emergency aid to small businesses, covering
damage to stock and fixtures, accounted for
$863,000.
Farm restoration payments-not
as reçoupment of capital losses but for the
loss of grain, seed feed, livestock and poultry,
rehabilitation of machinery, and acreage
grants for excess summerfallow which
resulted because the flooded lands could not
be seeded that year-amounted to $948,000.
Also, assistance was given in the amount of
$663,000 to non-profit organizations-and
there were many such-which were engaged
in giving relief. Provision for damage of over
$100 through seepage in areas which were
not inundated, the foundations of buildings
in many places having been undermined and
destroyed through the excessive seepage,
called for $764,000.
Then there were special payments for
damages in excess of the maximum assistance
granted by the Red River Valley Board, a
body which distributed federal and provincial assistance. These "related to exceptional cases which could net be fully met
through the provisions under which this board
was set up. The disbursements of these
funds was looked after by the committee
through an organization set up for that purpose. My recollection is that the chairman
was a retired ýsupervisor of the Royal Bank
of Canada, with whom were associated citizens of a similar standing. Inspectors were
engaged, and no relief was handed out without a full report on the position and needs
of the applicant. It can be said that all this
work was carried through with little if any
criticism.
The situation today is that the flood relief
committee bas on hand approximately $1,459,000. It is proposed to set up the corporation outlined in this bill and transfer to its
account the surplus I have mentioned, to be
available in the event of any similar disasters
which may hereafter occur anywhere in
Canada. It was necessary, of course, that the
provincial government should by legislative
act authorize the committee to transfer this
balance to the corporation, which is to be
set up by the Parliament of Canada. The
provincial government passed the necessary
legislation; and the bill before us is for the
establishment of the proposed corporation,

to which, with your consent, I shall make
brief reference.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: May I ask the honourable senator a question? I understand that
after the flood receded certain works, such
as dykes and roads and things of that
kind, were constructed to prevent or minimize
the effects of flooding in future. I know there
is a dyke on the east side of the river, as
well as one around Wildwood Park, and
there are several others in the city of Winnipeg. These have been in part built up, so
that if another flood should occur sandbags
could be placed on a firm foundation, and
the water held back. Was any part of the
money of which the honourable senator has
been speaking used for these purposes, or
were other funds furnished for this work by
the government of Manitoba or the Dominion
government?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I did not deal with the
point raised by the honourable senator fron
Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) because, strictly
speaking, it is not related to this bill. None
of the funds secured by this committee have
been used for the purposes he mentions. I
might say, in passing, although it is not
im.mediately relevant to this bill, that the
Winnipeg dyking was constructed by arrangement between the provincial government and
the federal government. The board made
surveys as to how a similar disaster may be
avoided in future and, as mentioned by our
colleague, constructed certain works, such as
dykes and pumping stations, and other works
of that kind. That was done at the joint
expense of the province and the federal
government. The relief moneys were used
for the purposes that I outlined earlier.
I come now to deal with the bill before
us. The corporation is to be known as the
Canadian Disaster Relief Fund, Incorporated.
For the purposes of this corporation Canada
is to be divided into five divisions: the Maritime division, being composed of the four
provinces down by the Atlantic; the Quebec
division, being the province of Quebec; the
Ontario division, being the province of
Ontario; the Prairie division, being the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta;
and the British Columbia division, being the
province of British Columbia.
The bill specifies that a person is not eligible to be appointed or to continue as a member for a division of the corporation unless
he is a resident of that division. He will hold
office until he reaches the age of seventyfive years.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Hear, hear.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Crerar: He may, however, be

removed at any time by the Secretary of
State for cause. Three members will constitute a quorum.
There is a provision in the bill for filling
any vacancy that may arise; and there is
another provision to the effect that a vacancy
may not impair or disqualify the other members of the board from acting.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Who appoints the members
in the first place?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: In the first place the

members will be appointed by this legislation;
and thereafter appointments will be made by
the Secretary of State when replacements
are required. The members elect from among
their own member a president, and they
appoint a secretary-treasurer and make the
bylaws governing the corporation. It is provided that the head office of the corporation
in the first instance will be established in
the city of Winnipeg, but the corporation is
given authority to move the head office elsewhere if it so desires?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Why was the city
of Winnipeg chosen?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I presume that Winnipeg
was named because that is where the funds
are, and where the disaster occurred. As I
have said, the corporation may move its head
office elsewhere if it is considered to be in
the interests of the corporation and of the
fund to do so. The fund consists of all the
money that is left, approximately $1,450,000.
The corporation may make payments out
of the fund for the purpose of meeting emergencies and needs arising in Canada from
flood, fire, tempest, earthquake, pestilence or
other disaster. That is the scope for which
the corporation can use the moneys entrusted
to it.
I should have stated before that the flrst
members of the corporation are named in the
bill. They are as follows: for the Maritime
Division, the Right Honourable J. L. Ilsley,
Chief Justice of Nova Scotia; for the Quebec
Division, the Honourable F. Philippe Brais,
C.B.E., Q.C.; for the Ontario Division, James
S. Duncan, C.M.G.; President of the Massey
Harris Company; for the Prairie Division,
H. W. Manning, Vice-President and Managing
Director of the Great West Life Assurance
Company; and for the British Columbia Division, A. E. Grauer, Ph.D., President and
Chairman of the Board, British Columbia
Power Corporation.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: It is a good group.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: It will be seen at once

that this corporation, as constituted, is not
only representative of the whole of Canada,

but is composed of what might fairly be described as outstanding citizens of the dominion.

The

characute

of

the men who,7,

il

compose the corporation in the first instance
is a sufficient guarantee that the corporation's work will be well and competently
done.
There is little more that I need to add.
The corporation has the sole authority and
discretion to determine whether the emergency and need arising from any particular
disaster warrants the making of payments
out of the fund, and, may make payments
to the extent and in the manner it -deems
desirable and proper. All expenses of administration are paid from the fund. The corporation may make the necessary bylaws for the
governance of its business. It may invest the
funds entrusted to it, with the limitation that
they must be invested in the bonds or other
securities of or guaranteed by the government of Canada, or of any province thereof,
or of any municipality in Canada. It is also
provided that the corporation may co-operate
with any association or organization established anywhere in Canada for purposes
similar to those of the corporation.
The funds of the corporation must be
audited once a year by a qualified chartered
accountant. The final provision of the bill
is that on or before March 31 in each year
the corporation Shall submit to the Secretary of State of Canada a report on its transactions and the administration of the fund
for the year ending the 31st day of December
immediately preceding. The report, of course,
shall contain a copy of the latest audited
statement of the accounts of the fund.
Honourable senators, that covers the provisions of the legislation now before the bouse.
The people of Manitoba were deeply grateful
for the magnificent response that was made
all across Canada at the time of the Red
River floods.
The Canadian people certainly opened their
hearts at that time. A suggestion was made,
though it got no support, that the unexpended
balance of the fund should be retained for
use in Manitoba, but there was an overwhelming feeling that such a thing would be
unfortunate and wrong. Therefore, if this
legislation is passed, this fund will be made
available to meet needs arising from any
disaster anywhere in the whole dominion.
Out of this flood disaster there came, as
I have said, a great and generous response
from the Canadian people. In a day when
we are perhaps tending more and more to
look to governments for help in every phase
of our lives, it is refreshing to witness a
demonstration of generosity and sympathy

who handled the disbursements did an

exceptionally good job and gave general
satisfaction. But there is one thought I
would like to express at this time. Between
five and six million dollars has been spent
by the federal and the provincial governments to build a dyke around the city of
Winnipeg with a view to preventing recurrence of a flood such as we had in 1950. In
its present state the dyke is not high enough
to prevent the flooding of some parts of the
city, but there is a foundation on which the
authorities can build to effect this object.
We in the rural parts, however, have no
protection against the future. I have already
recounted to this house the number of fioods
that I have seen in my short life, and against
which we had no protection whatever. The
new dyke is well and solidly built. But,
though I am not an engineer, I am under the
impression that the confining of water
between dykes, though preventing it from
spreading and covering a lot of territory,
will raise the level of the water from the
Red River valley to the boundary higher than
it was before. So while those of us who
inhabit that area are thankful for the fundthankful to the people of Canada and those
of other parts of the world, and thankful to
the men who administered it-we are not
without concern for the future. My honourable friends the leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) and the honourable member for Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) have no
cause for worry, because, living in Winnipeg,
they are protected by the dykes. But I
have some worries in this connection.
I understand that the Joint Waterways
Commission is making an intensive study
of the whole Red River basin. I am of the
opinion that their report should be out soon,
and I hope that it will include a recommendation that Canada and the United States, in
a joint enterprise, will make provision either
to retain the water south or to so order its
flow that it will not inundate the surrounding
areas. I suggest, and I think we should so
recommend, that when the report is received
the two governments should urge appropriate
action to protect the whole Red River basin
from Minnesota to the city of Winnipeg.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I think it might not be amiss for me to say
a word. The honourable leader on this side
of the house (Hon. Mr. Haig) mentioned the
donations in kind for flood relief by the
British people, but I do not recall that he
referred to the particular value of the livestock. I attended at Brandon a sale of livestock donated from England. It included
Guernseys, Jerseys, Red Polls, Herefords and
Aberdeen-Angus, and the finest sheep I
'38112-21

ever saw in my life; all of them most beautiful animals. I recall that the lambs sold
for about $435 each. The value of this livestock to Canada is far more than the mere
price of the animals. They were young
animals of a very high-pedigree type. Altogether is was a wonderful donation; and I
think it is well to mention it at the present
time, when we are seeing pictures of the
flood damage in England and hearing of the
loss of so much livestock over there.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
I rise to say a few words on this bill. First
of all, may I commend the purpose of the
bill which has been introduced by the honourable gentleman from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar). It seems to establish a new department, shall I say, in the line of public welfare,
and I think the whole idea is splendid. As
I listened to the speeches made by the honourable senators from Manitoba I could not
help thinking that the flood relief fund
which was set up to help the victims of the
Red River Valley floods of May, 1950 had its
precedence in the fund established to assist
the victims of -the Fraser Valley flood in 1948.
The assistance given by the federal government at that time to the people of the Fraser
Valley was a new departure: I think it was
the first time that the federal government
had come to the relief of people in flooded
areas. Now that we have started to recognize
national disasters of this kind, appeals for
assistance will come forth whenever such
events occur in the future, and communities
will be appealing directly to this new
corporation.
Honourable senators, I trust that we are
not starting out to set up another crown
company. I do not say this in a derogatory
way, nor do I wish to cast any reflection on
the good names of the persons who have been
named as the first members of the corporation.
I should like to point out something in
connection with the Fraser River flood. The
flood occurred during a period of unseasonably hot weather, when the melted snows of
the interior caused the river to rise some
twenty-four feet. The river had been known
to flood in other years, of course, but it
reached its all-time disastrous peak in 1948.
At the same time other areas also in British
Columbia were flooded. I remember one
delegation of ten men coming to see me. They
had all lost their homes, but as they did not
live in the Fraser valley they were ineligible
for any benefits from the flood relief fund
set up for the people of that area. They said
to me: "Can you tell us what difference it
makes whether we live in the Fraser Valley

SENATE
or elsewhere? We have all lost our homes
as a result of floods." It was impossible to
give them a gooci reason why Lhe.y should
not receive assistance from federal or provincial funds in the same way as the victims
of the Fraser Valley flood. The unfortunate
fact is, though, that those people outside the
Fraser Valley received no assistance at all.
Now, I think it is important that this
corporation should be careful in the way it
distributes these public funds. I have seen
cases where people have been unable to get
assistance merely because they have been
insufficient in numbers to warrant the attention of any government. I should like to
know what will constitute a disaster area.
Will it be a community in which ten or fifty
or one hundred people live? Extensive loss of
property in a small community is just as serious to every citizen there as if he or she had
suffered the loss in a larger community.
In conclusion, I repeat my hope that this
fine corporation will not ultinately become a
crown company.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, may I congratulate my honourable
colleague from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
upon his explanation of this bill, and express
my sympathy with the purposes of the
legislation. At the same time I must say
there are features of the bill which remain
unclear to me. Do I understand that we are
incorporating a new type of institution of a
continuing natureHon. Mr. Reid: Like a crown company?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes-, like a crown company-as the member for New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid) has said-which will act in
the event of future disasters? Is it to replace
the local authorities in some way when disasters occur? Is it to be a continuing institution or is it to be for a special purpose? If it
is to be a continuing institution, will it have
power to go on accepting contributions? And
if it is not to be a continuing institution, why
is this fact not stated in the bill? I would
gather from reading the bill that the corporation has an ancillary power authorizing it to
continue indefinitely to accept contributions
and make distributions. How is this corporation to terminate if it is not the kind of
corporation which I think it is from. reading
the bill? There is no provision for the surrender of the charter or the termination of
the responsibilities to be undertaken by the
corporation. By what process will the men
now in charge of the fund, who are undoubtedly acting in the nature of trustees, divest
themselves of their responsibilities and transfer then to this corporation?

The usual method for trustees under such
circumstances as these is to apply to the court
for dircotion, at the samP time making suggestions how the balance of their fund can
be used for a similar charitable purpose.
Are these men going to act as trustees? Do
they intend to get authority from the court
to pass their responsibilities over to the proposed corporation? If not, how is the corporation to get the money? I do not see that
the bill gives to the corporation authority to
take over the money. How can the present
trustees divest themselves of their authority,
and why is there any need for a corporation?
These men could get authority from the courts
and be protected in the discharge of their
responsibility. Why is it necessary for parliament to step in and establish a new
institution?
From a legal point of view I am in somewhat of a quandary as to the purpose of
this bill. That of course is quite apart from
the excellent motives which prompted the
bringing of the petition to parliament, and
the high-minded way in which the proposed
legislation has been handled by the senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar). I am
in complete sympathy with the sentiments
expressed by honourable senators who have
spoken on this bill, but from a legal standpoint, I do not understand it.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, if
no one else wants to speak at this time, I
should perhaps close the discussion with a
few remarks.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: I must warn
honourable senators that if the mover of the
motion makes his reply now he will close
the debate.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The bill before us deals
only with the surplus remaining from the
subscriptions to the Winnipeg relief fund, and
has no relation to expenditures made by
governments or municipalities. I had before
me information as to those expenditures, but
as I considered it irrelevant I omitted it
from my earlier remarks. Perhaps I was
mistaken in doing so, and I am therefore
grateful to the leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig)
for the information he supplied. It is of some
interest when one considers the whole situation as it developed, but it has no relation
to the bill before us.
Likewise, the point raised by the honourable senator from St. Jean Baptiste (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien) might have been dealt with
in the explanation of the bill, but in my
opinion it was scarcely relevant to the dis-

position of the $1- million which remained
in the fund. My honourable friend raised the
question of protection in the event of a recurrence of such a flood as we had in 1950, and

FEERUARY 25, 1953
I think he inytimated that the Canadian and
American authorities, through the International Waterways Commission, are making
a study of the headwaters of the Red river
in Minnesota. It may 'be possible to create
at its source the necessary works to hoid
back the water and f eed it more gradually
into the main stream.
The probiem which arises in that connection
is that the terrain through which the river
flows is about as level as the floor of this
chamber, with a gentie fail from the headwaters of the river to Lake Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: The f ail is about a foot
in a mile.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: It is a gentie fall, and
the water moves slowiy around an infinite
variety of curves and bends ail the way fromn
the international border to Lake Winnipeg.
But, as I say, that problem. is under study
by the International Waterways Commission.
It would be possible to guard against a
recurrence of flooding on the Assiniboine
river by building works back along the river,
because west of Winnipeg, 150 miles or so,
it bas more substantial banks.
I come now to the point raised by my
honourable frîend from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck). I believe he is unduly disturbed about certain features of the proposai.
The bill is, after ail, a very simple one. The
committee which was originally set up
received subscriptions totalling considerably
in excess of $9 million; it disbursed somewhat more than $7,700,000, and has an
approximate balance on hand. of $1,450,000.
The question was, what to do with that
balance.
The committee gave consideration to the
possibility of refunding the balance to the
subscribers who had contributed to the fund,
but they came to the conclusion'that it was
too expensive to do so. They concluded that
it might be practical to set up this balance in
such a way -as to make it availabie for relief
elsewhere in Canada, from where the main
contributions were received. The committee
could perhaps have applied to the court in
Winnipeg for a direction as to, the proper
disposai of the balance. That mîght have
been a sound procedure. However, it was
decided, as I have said, that the balance of
this fund should be made available to meet
similar distress elsewhere in Canada. Consequently, the committee hit upon the idea of
setting up a dominion corporation, and it
secured the necessary authority from the
legislature
of Manitoba
protecting the
members of the committee in the disposai of
the fund.
68112-21J

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Is it proposed that a
provincial act be passed dealing with this
fund?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: A provincial act has
already been passed. *Under le gal advice, the
committee concluded that that procedure was
desirable. The only limitation attached to
the provincial act is that the funds must be
spent within Canada; and that limitation is
carried forward in the legisiation now
before us.
The proposed corporation is not a crown
company. The body of Canadian citizens
who will constitute the proposed corporation
wîhl not get a dollar directly or indirectly
from the federal government.
Hon. Mr. Reid: They might get something.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: They could not get any
grant of further funds without approval by
parliament, and there is no authority in this
legisiation by which. the dominion government can give them a dollar.
Hon. Mr. Reid: They could, get it if parliament approved.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Of course they could do
anything in this matter if parliament
approved; but if parliament bas to give
approval, the matter will come back here and
then we can discuss it. So this idea-a simple,
and I think on the whole a very sound oneprovides that the balance of funds be made
available in this way; and the five distinguished gentlemen whose naines appear in
the bill can, within their discretion, and not
at the suggestion of the Manitoba government,
or the federal government, or anyone else,
give relief to those who suifer fromn similar
disasters elsewhere. When ail the money
has been disbursed there will be nothing more
for the corporation to do. It may remain in
our law machinery as, so to speak, a dead
letter; or, more probably, the government
of the day or some private member will introduce a bill to cancel this legisiation and we
shahl then go back to where we were 'before.
I do not know that I can add anything
further. To my mind the bihl is a pretty
sensible way of handling the problem.
Han. Mr. Reid: May I ask if the chief
problem is to distribute the one and a hait
million dollars which remain in the fund,
what is the purpose of providing ail the
powers set out in section 7, including the
right to, hold, mortgage and buy property?
Read the whole clause. These are pretty
wide powers.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I do not know that I get
the point of my honourable friend's question.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Reid: The question is this.

What

the objeC t nf section 7? It says:
The corporation may, for the purpose of carrying out its objects, acquire by purchase, lease,
gift, legacy or otherwise any real or personal property, rights and privileges own and hold any such
property, rights or privileges, and sell, manage,
develop, lease, mortgage, dispose of or otherwise
deal therewith in such manner as the corporation
may determine.
i

Hon. Mr. Crerar: As I understand it, the
purpose is very simple. For instance if, when
he comes to make his will, my honourable
friend decides that a good way of disposing
of some of his estate is by a donation to this
disaster relief fund, he can dispose of part
of his estate in favour of this corporation.
The corporation does not need: to accept it,
but may accept it.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is to say, this is
a continuing corporation, and may accept
donations.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That will depend. That
possibility is there, but only if generousminded individuals decide that this is a
desirable way to give relief.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Or if an active-minded
secretary wishes to perpetuate his position.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Crerar: I assume it will be the
wish of the house that the bill go to committee.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Exactly.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: With leave, I move that
the bill be referred to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
PROPOSED REMISSION OF FEES

may intrude again for a moment, may we
revert to motions, so that I may move:

This is of the nature of a charitable disposition of funds, and I think it is customary in
most cases to waive payment of these fees.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Not until the bill is
passed.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: I think it
is customary for the bill first to be passed.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That may be so. I was
advised by the Clerk of Committees that the
proper time to make the motion I have just
made was after second reading.

Hon. Mr. Haig: That has never been done.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: If I am not in order, that
is my excuse.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: I would suggest that the honourable senator withhold his
motion until after the bill has been reported
back to the house from the committee, and
read the third time.
CANADA

SHIPPING BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. Wishar± McL. Roberison moved the
second reading of Bill D-7, an Act to amend
the Canada Shipping Act, 1934.
He said: Honourable senators, the bill is
divided into three parts. Part I contains the
amendments to the present act. Part II
repeats the amendments to conform with the
new Revised Statutes which are now in the
press and are expected to appear during the
present session. Part III relates to the coming into force of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1948.
Clause 1 of the bill amends paragraphs (a)
to (f) of subsection (1) of section 114 of the
act. The purpose of this amendment is to
bring uniformity as between steam and motor
engineers' certificates.
The application of the amendment will
require that, in certain cases, engineers of
ships propelled by internal combustion
engines hold a higher grade of certificate.
The board considers this necessary in view
of the development and complications of the
modern internal combustion engine, which
requires more practical and technical knowledge than was necessary heretofore. In order
not to infiict a hardship on the present
holders of engineer certificates, provision is
made so that the amendment will not affect
the rights and powers of certificates now
issued.
Clause 2 of the bill amends section 406 of
the act relating to radio equipment.
Section 406 (2) of the act requires that all
passenger steamships carrying fifty or more
persons and going on certain coastal or inland
voyages shall be fitted with a radiotelegraph
installation complying with the provisions of
the safety convention. The act also requires
that all steamships, other than passenger
steamships, of 5,000 tons gross tonnage and
upwards going on voyages of more than 200
miles from one place to another place shall,
unless exempted by the Governor in Council
carry radiotelegraph apparatus.
Representations have been made with
respect to Pacific coast shipping, asking for
an extension of the requirements to cover all
passenger steamships plying Pacific coast
waters. New subsection (2) of section 406 is

FEBRUAltY 25, 1953
designed to require all passenger steamships
exceeding 65 feet in length going on any
voyage outside of a port to be fitted with a
radiotelegraph installation complying with
the provisions of the safety convention. Provision is made in the amendment that radio
operators shall not engage in any other duties
which in any way interfere with the keeping
of watches. Provision is also made for
exempting certain vessels where it is expedient to do so; for example, in the case of ferry
ships or other vessels going on short voyages
in protected waters there would not appear
to be any necessity to carry radiotelegraph
installations, particularly if these vessels carry
radiotelephone.
New subsection (3) covers cargo steamships
of 500 tons gross tonnage and upwards and
steamships under 500 tons engaged in towing
another vessel of 500 tons or over, or towing
any other floating object such as a raft of
logs having a dimension in any direction of
150 feet or more. These ships are required
to carry radiotelephone installations unless
exempted. It is considered that where such
ships carry a radiotelphone installation and
are plying on short voyages or in protected
waters the provisions of a radiotelegraph
installation may not be required.
New subsection (4) provides for exemption
from the obligations imposed by subsections
(2) and (3).
New subsection (5) requires that the operating conditions of the radio installation on
board any vessel covered by section 406 shall
comply with the radio regulations annexed
to the International Telecommunication Convention in force. The convention now in
force is the one signed at Atlantic City
in 1947.
New subsection (6) provides for regulations
requiring any ship navigating on the Great
Lakes and River St. Lawrence above the
Lachine canal and Victoria bridge at Montreal
to be fitted with a radiotelephone installation.
This subsection will enable the government
to implement the agreement for the promotion of safety on the Great Lakes by means
of radio which was made with the United
States and signed on February 21, 1952. This
agreement will not come into force until two
years after the day on which instruments of
ratification are exchanged between the two
governments.
The amendment to section 475 of the act
provides that tow barges that carry crew
shall be subject to the regulations concerning
life saving equipment, fire extinguishing
equipment, precautions against fire and the
provisions of the act relating to inspection of
boilers not used for propelling purposes. Tow
barges that carry passengers are now subject
to inspection under section 472 of the act.

The amendment contained in clause 4 of the
bill is designed to provide for the appointment
under the Civil Service Act of port wardens
and deputy port wardens.
The Canada Shipping Act was brought into
force in Newfoundland at the date of union
except section 21 relating to security to be
given on registration of ships, and Part VI
relating to pilotage. The purpose of this
clause is to provide for the bringing into
force in Newfoundland of these excepted provisions. Until section 21 and Part VI are
proclaimed, the laws in force in Newfoundland continue in effect.
Part II is merely for the purpose of the
new Revised Statutes.
Part III is for the purpose of covering the
transition period between the coming into
force on December 31, 1952, of the amended
sections of the Canada Shipping Act relating
to the new safety convention of 1948 and the
repeal of the corresponding sections relating
to the old safety convention of 1929 which
ceases to be effective in Canada on November
19, 1953. Ships belonging to countries which
are not parties to the new safety convention
but which are parties to the old safety convention will have to be covered until November 19, 1953.
Honourable senators will have observed
that the amendments to the bill have to do
with regulations in respect to internal combustion engines, radio telephones and radio
telegraphs. These regulations are of a technical nature, and if the Senate sees fit to give
the bill second reading I would move that it
be referred to the Standing Committee on
Transport and Communications, where the
officials of the department could give us
further detailed information.
Hon. J. J. Kinley: Honourable senators, it
is not my intention to discuss the details or
the principle of the bill. As has been
explained by the honourable leader (Hon. Mr.
Robertson), the proposed changes are of a
technical nature and have been found necessary because of the advance of science in relation to the operation of ships.
These details can be better considered in
committee, but I want to take advantage of
this occasion-the second reading of a shipping bill-to allude to the death of a fine
seamafi who was closely associated with the
province of Nova Scotia during a period when
Nova Scotians excelled in the construction
and operation of sailing vessels, especially in
the deep sea fisheries. I want to pay a few
words of tribute ito the memory of Captain
Ben Pine of Gloucester, Massachusetts, who
passed away on Monday. Captain Ben was the
last skipper of a fishing vessel to sail out of

SENATE

the port of Gloucester. He was internationally
known as the skipper of the racing fishing

My honourable friend from Halifax (Hon.
Mr. Dennis), in hi-s abundant energy and

schooner Gertrude L. Thebaud, which com-

tnrough the infiuence uf his newspaper, was

peted in international races between Canada
and the United States. Captain Pine was
born in the village of Belleoram, in Fortune
Bay, in the then dominion of Newfoundland.
He went to Gloucester at an early age to join
the ranks of so many of those fine seamen
who left Newfoundland and who eventually
helped to build up the fishing industry of
New England. He was a man of deep and
fine personality, who radiated the generous
and liberal comradeship of the sea.
The international racing in which he competed was unique, because it was participated
in by bona fide fishing schooners. The races
were a real test of skill in the construction
of vessels, and of seamanship in the sailing
of them.
We in Nova Scotia were very elated when
the schooner Bluenose, skippered by Captain
Angus Walters, finally became Queen of the
Atlantic. In sport one likes to prevail over
those one most admires; and when we prevailed over the American schooners we knew
that we had won over the best. For that
reason we were proud of the achievement.
Those classic contests between seafaring
men of Canada and the United States were
of intense interest in the Maritimes, and did
much to elevate the morale of seamen. They
were as well a source of delightful entertainment for people the world over who were
interested in ships and sailors.

a moving spirit in this great sporting event.
Others in Nova Scotia, including myself, were
associated with him in carrying out the plans
and international arrangements. Thus we
learned a great deal about the personnel
engaged in the competition; and we could see
that Captain Ben Pine was a skilful skipper
and a general favourite.
Time marches on, and that period is now
passed. The days of the big fishing schooners,
under sail from Gloucester and Lunenburg,
are now gone for ever. But they will always
bring happy memories, retold in story and
recounted in the festive hours so natural to
a sea-going people who delight in great
achievements on the seas. Captain Ben
Pine will have an abiding place in our
hearts. I am proud to pay tribute to the
memory of a man who will always be admired
in the shipping history of Nova Scotia.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

INTERNATIONAL TRADE

MOTION

MOTION AGREED TO

Hon. Mr. Buchanan: Honourable senators,
with leave I move:

The Senate resumed from Tuesday,
February 24, the adjourned debate on the
motion of Hon. Mr. MeLean that the Standing
Committee on Canadian Trade Relations be
empowered to inquire into and report upon
the development of trade between countries
signatory to the North Atlantic Treaty, and
with other countries of the free world.
Hon. G. P. Burchill: Honourable senators,
it is hardly necessary for anybody coming

That the Standing Committee on Tourist Traffe
be empowered to inquire into and report upon the
activities of the various agencies concerned with
promoting tourist travel in Canada, and that the
committee be authorized to send for persons and
records.

I would ask that this motion be adopted
today because the committee plans to meet
to commence carrying out the purposes of the

SENATE
from the Maritime provinces to give reasons
why he fully supports the objects of the
resolution before the house. Export trade is
the very lifeblood of our section of Canada,
and any move to stimulate the export trade
by enlarging our present markets and securing new ones, or to accelerate the flow of
goods in general, will find very active and
united support from all the people who live
down by the sea.
Sone Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Our geographical position and the pattern which has been followed
in Canada's development and growth since
confederation have not been very kind to the
Maritimes. I do not suggest that my friends
who sit on the opposition side of this house
had anything to do with the evolution of that
pattern; nevertheless, the pattern was followed, and by reason of it the industrial
development of the Maritimes has been very
limited.
The distance which separates us from the
Montreal, Quebec and Ontario markets, and
the consequential high freight costs, particularly since the recent increases, have had the
effect of almost placing a barrier between
the Maritimes and the markets of the rest
of Canada. For that reason it is almost impossible for Maritime industries to compete with
industries in Quebec and Ontario. The Maritimes must look for markets overseas and
to the south.
It has been said many times that in order
to keep the wheels of Canadian industry
turning, trade must flow both ways; but
let me emphasize that trade between the
Maritime provinces and the rest of Canada
is practically a one-way street. It follows
that we live in an economy entirely different
from that enjoyed by the wealthier and more
industrialized provinces. True, the Maritimes
have made progress during the past ten years,
but our rate of growth has been much slower
than that of the rest of Canada, and the
difference is widening all the time. A distinguished Ottawa journalist who once toured
the Maritimes wrote afterwards, and quite
properly, that the people down there were
poor, proud and patriotic.
Recently I had the privilege of sitting as
a member of a selection committee at the
University of New Brunswick, in Fredericton,
to interview applicants for the Beaverbrook
overseas scholarship. As many honourable
senators know, Lord Beaverbrook has been
most generous to his native province of New
Brunswick. Among the many benefactions
which he has given to the university is the
valuable and coveted annual overseas scholarship, which entitles the holder-who must

be a graduate of the university-to a oneyear post-graduate course at the University
of London, and to the privilege oif

iavelliig

in Great Britain. Every year the selection
committee has great difficulty in making a
choice from among many brilliant young
Canadians, both men and women. Some of
these students not only have outstanding
records at the University of New Brunswick,
but come with glowing recommendations
from such institutions of learning as Harvard
and McGill. They are scientists, doctors,
lawyers, economists and teachers, all of them
born in New Brunswick.
As we met and made our choice on this
last occasion I could not get away from a
feeling of frustration, for I knew that probably not one of those young men and women
would be able to find suitable employment
in their native province. In all probability
they will follow the thousands of others who
have gone out from the Maritime provinces
to occupy prominent positions as leaders in
churches, members of the Bench, and heads
of educational institutions, banks and commercial corporations located in the more
prosperous parts of Canada and in the United
States.
There are lots of Maritimers everywhere,
except in the Maritimes. Some honourable
members talk about debts owed by other
parts of Canada to the West for growing
wheat, or for some other reason. But I submit that the Maritime provinces have paid
to the rest of the country any debt owed and
in good measure, by the contribution they
have made to Canada in providing citizens of
the best stock in the world. That is a. contribution which cannot be measured in dollars and cents.
To provide the proper training and course
for these young people, the universities of
the Maritimes are doing a grand job; but,
with them, finances are always a problem.
I notice in the press that the province of
Quebec is declining federal aid for universities. If that is so, speaking as a member of
the Senate of the University of New Brunswick, with some knowledge of university
financial needs, I would like to suggest to
the government that these funds should not
be allowed to go begging, for I can assure
you they would be very thankfully received
and profitably used by the universities of the
Maritime provinces.
I said a few moments ago that we in the
Maritimes live in a different economy from
that of wealthier provinces. I do not think
there is any better way of measuring the
tempo of business than by long distance telephone calls. Last week I had an opportunity
to check the records of the New Brunswick

FEBRUARY 26, 1953
Telephone Company, and I found a marked
falling off in their toll message business. January business had fallen short of the estimate
and showed a downward trend. This trend
is not evident in other sections of Canada,
where the estimated increase over the preceding year is being maintained. This may
be only a temporary fluctuation, and may
right itself in the next month or so; but in the
meantime I began to examine the possible
causes for this, and I did not have far to go.
I found, for one thing, that business at the
port of Saint John was very slack this winter.
Steamers were leaving without full cargoes,
and the longshoremen were suffering from
lack of work. One of them told me he had
had only one day's work the previous week.
I am not going to answer this, but I will pose
it as a question: whether Canada is pricing
herself out of the markets of the world. On
further examination, I discovered that Canadian exporters were shipping their goods
through United States ports rather than
through the national ports of Halifax and
Saint John. The figures indicate that this
trend of diversion to the United States,
including Boston, Portland, and particularly
New York, is increasing. Whereas $155,427,000 worth of export goods had been
diverted to American ports in 1949, the figure
increased to $257,591,000 in 1951. On the
import side, $27 million worth of goods had
gone to American ports in 1949, while $87
million goods value, destined for Canada had
come in through American ports in 1951.
The figures for 1952 are not available, but
indications point strongly to the fact that
the figures for the last year show an even
greater volume shipped via the United States.
In breaking these amounts down, I found
that the number of automobiles and motor
vehicles routed through United States ports
was 15,665 in 1949, and through Canadian
ports for the same year 13,944.
Hon. Mr. Vien: For export?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: For export. But in 1951,
a total of 59,465 vehicles had passed through
American ports, while only 10,011 had gone
through Canadian ports. These are most
astounding figures. In automobile parts, the
figures showed that $4,771,000 worth of parts
had been routed through United States' ports
in 1949, while parts to the value of $5,056,000
had gone through Canadian ports. In 1951
the amount through United States ports
increased to $8,435,000, while the Canadian
amount had fallen back to $4,534,000.
I understand that efforts have been made
by all our Canadian transportation interests
to have Canadian products routed through
68112-22

Canadian ports, but apparently not much
progress has been made.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Is there any difference in
the cost?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I am told there is not:
many things are involved, but cost is not one
of them.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Could the honourable
gentleman give us the breakdown as between
summer and winter traffic?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: No, I have not got that.
Hon. Mr. Vien: The honourable senator
knows that the reason why much of this
export traffic goes by the American seaboard
is that bottoms are not always available at
Canadian ports for certain destinations.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: That may be a factor,
but I am not sure it is the main factor. I
have no reason to believe so.
Hon. Mr. Vien: On many occasions it is,
because bottoms for a certain destination
are available from New York, Philadelphia,
Baltimore or Boston. Traffic seeks the route
of least resistance; and it is not always easy,
although of course it is highly desirable, to
route it through Canadian ports.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: One of the difficulties
seems to be that our so-called Canadian companies leave the routing of their goods in the
hands of the parent companies in the United
States, which use American transportation
systems, including their port facilities.
Practically everything the Maritime provinces use they buy from Quebec and Ontario,
whose manufacturers enjoy a good measure
of producton. In the matter of motor cars,
I think everyone will agree that the Canadian manufacturer has pretty generous protection from his American competitor, and
that the Canadian user of automobiles and
trucks is paying a fairly heavy toll for the
privilege of being a good patriotic Canadian
and supporting the Canadian automotive
industry. In case there is a tendency to
forget, it might be just as well to remind
ourselves from time to time what this is
costing us.
Here are some of the comparisons as quoted
in an editorial in the Brockville Recorder and
Times of February 20, 1953, under the heading
"Tariff Protection is Costing You Money." I
quote from the editorial:
Canadians who own motor cars, and so many of
us do, will be interested In seeing in figures the
extra car costs that Canadians bear, as compared
with Americans, because of tariff, excise and sales
tax imposed on our automobiles. Here is a comparison of United States and Canadian car prices,
on twenty different popular makes.

SENATE
I am not going to weary the house by
comparing prices on twenty different makes,
but I have selected a few weil-kiowu cars
in order to give honourable senators some
idea of the comparison. The following are
the retail prices at the point of manufacture:
Canada

2,333
Plymouth ..................
2,852
Mercury ...................

$1,670
1,721
1,821
2,230
2,066
3,364

3.666

That last one belongs to a class of car
which some of my honourable friends drive.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Could my honourable friend
tell me what portion of the difference in prices
is attributable to tariff, to sales and to excise
tax?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I shall obtain that information for my honourable friend at another
time.
The Maritimes provide a large market for
these cars and other motor vehicles. The
figures for 1952 show that the sales of automobiles and commercial vehicles in the four
provinces by the sea are as follows:
Vehicles
Newfoundland
......... .4,615
Prince Edward Island .. 2,258
Nova Scotia ............ 13,182
New Brunswick ....... .11,214

Costing
$10,518,000
5,083,000
31,246,000
27,240,000

Hon. Mr. Howard: That is a lot of money.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Honourable senators can
see from these figures just how the purchasers in the Maritimes are supporting the Canadian auto industry, and what it is costing
them to do so. It is, therefore, difficult for
the man in the street down there to understand the attitude of the manufacturers in
this same industry who will not even route
their export business through Maritime ports.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Does the honourable gentleman know the various destinations to which
these motor vehicles were shipped?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I am sorry, but I have
not got that information.
Hon. Mr. Vien: It would be an important
factor in determining the cause of the routing.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Yes, I agree that it
would.
New Brunswick is also feeling very much
the effects of a slackening in demand for pulp
and other forest products. Aside from newsprint, there is at present a weakening in
demand and price for pulp products, and the
back-log of orders at our pulp mills has disappeared. There is little or no market for
vulpwood, and the export lumber market is

not as buoyant as it was. These changes, together with the curtailment of pit prop orders,
have made P great diiffprence in the living of

a large proportion of our population who
depend for their livelihood on our forest
product industries. Indeed the slackening of
demand in these industries reflects upon the
economy of the entire province.
Here again New Brunswick is dependent
upon export trade. Our traditional market
is Great Britain-first it was in wooden ships,
then in pine timber, followed by spruce deals
and pit props. Our trade in this latter commodity illustrates what sterling and the currency problem mean to us. Developed at the
beginning of the last Great War, pit props
have become one of our very important
exports. The industry uses jack pine; it
employs many men and trucks, and it gives
our longshoremen at the various ports much
needed employment.
Last year Great Britain imported a total of
712,000 cords of pit props, of which 350,000
cords came from, Eastern Canada, and the
remainder from Finland, Russia and Sweden.
If converted to fathoms, I think the figures
would be 210,000 fathoms from Canada and
194,000 from Finland.
So far this year
Britain has purchased only about 226,000
fathoms, or the equivalent of 380,000 cords.
This total is made up of 59,000 fathoms to
come from Finland, 60,000 from Russia,
62,000 from Sweden and only 45,000 from
Canada. It is hoped that the purchases from
us will be increased later on in the year,
but in the meantime this year's reductionthe sales being about one-quarter of last
year's figure-has dislocated our forest industry and made a great difference in the
employment of woodsworkers and trucks, as
well as longshoremen at the ports of New
Brunswick.

It will be noted that of the countries I
have named as supplying Great Britain with
pit props, Canada alone is paid in dollars.
The other countries belong to the sterling
bloc. While freight charges and conditions
in those countries are al factors to be considered, honourable senators will realize that
the fact that Canada will accept only dollars
in payment for pit props weighs against us
in our competition for this business which is
so important to our province, and it is one

of the reasons why the quantity purchased
from Canada has been so materially reduced.
What has been said about pit props could
also be said about lumber and other forest
products. Any restrictions, therefore, in currency or anything else that hampers the sale
of goods from Canada to Great Britain and
other sterling areas has a very direct and
serious impact on the well-being of New
Brunswick and the other Maritime provinces.

FEBRUARY 26, 1953
Honourable senators, I am not sufficiently
well versed in economics or finances to
enlarge upon the mechanics by which sterling can be converted and used by Canadian
exporters. I certainly have faith in the
pound sterling, and I believe that it will
eventually regain its former value. And as
economic ties and profitable trade relations
are necessary, if we are to be good neighbours and have happy political relations with
other nations, I feel that surely some way
can be found whereby, without endangering
the soundness of Canada's dollar and fiscal
system, we shall be able to accept a limited
amount of sterling. I have in mind the
good effects which as a consequence would
flow to Canada generally, and to the Maritime provinces in particular, through the
maintenance of a high level of employment
and business activity, and through the
strengthening and re-establishment of historic and traditional ties which have bound
us for so many years to the United Kingdom
and of which many of us retain and cherish
pleasant memories.
Soine Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. A. Neil McLean: Honourable senators,The Hon. the Speaker: I must warn honourable senators that when the mover of
the motion (Hon. Mr. McLean) makes his
reply, he will close the debate.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, before the debate is closed I should
like to express my appreciation of the
excellent speeches that have been made
in the course of this debate, not the least
having been the eloquent, forceful, fluent
and realistic speech just made by the senator
from Northumberland (Hon. Mr. Burchill).
Perhaps I may be permitted to make reference also to the excellent addresses by
the senators from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
and Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan), and
by the leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Robertson). These speeches have all been
very much to my liking, because they
seemed to emphasize the sound principles of
trade as applied to the dominion of Canada.
I suppose the Canadian people would
scarcely expect from the allegedly conservative members of the Upper House such
realistic and forward-looking addresses as
those to which I have referred. The Senate
of today is, not a backward- but rather a
forward-looking house, in which a great deal
of practical thinking is done.
I should like to make two or three comments arising out of the speeches which I
mentioned. It has been suggested that in
some way we should bring about a change
68112--22;

in the dollar-pound relationship. I would be
very glad to see such a change brought about,
and the way to do it is to open our ports to
British goods. In that way the British people
will have more dollars with which to buy
our goods. On the other hand, the most
impractical way of accomplishing that end is
by our underwriting the currency of another
country.
Within my time in this house, we have
had one experience of Canada attempting to
underwrite Canadian currency in its relationship to the currency of another country. We
guaranteed a ten per cent difference between
our money and that of the United States,
irrespective of the market value of one or
the other, with the result that within about
a year and a half we poured down the drain
something like $1J billion. Naturally, I am
opposed to any such method of approach to
the problem. I am, however, in favour of
allowing our own currency and that of other
countries to stand on their own feet. When
that course was chosen the result was nothing
but good.
So far in this debate we have been talking
in an academic way. The Liberal party has
many times been accused of talking free
trade and practising protection. That charge
has, unfortunately, perhaps been true. On the
other hand, our Conservative friends have
not only talked protection, but at the same
time they have practised it. There may be
some virtue in talking about the principle
of free trade, even without doing all that is
possible to put it into effect.
Honourable senators, I have watched public
opinion in action for many years. As a boy
I heard the false doctrine put over that when
a protective tariff is levied the foreigner pays
it. Perhaps in a sense he does just that, but
in the -end the Canadian consumer pays it
in the extra cost of the goods he buys. We
are now told that a protective tariff is levied
by the government upon our own people and
that they pay it.
I do not suggest that none of the hoary old
fallacies still remain. One of these is that
we cannot adopt low tariffs or free trade
until other nations of the world do the same.
That fallacy was expressed even in this
debate, the speaker little realizing that the
Canadian tariff is a levy upon our own people
and paid for in their purchases of goods.
However, though I realize that trade is a
two-way street, I say that the tariff policies
of other nations are their own business and
not ours.
I recall that one of the early tariffs of the
United States was imposed when I was a boy,
and that I spent six poverty-stricken years
on a Canadian farm as a result of it. Those

SENATE

British mnrket.

as we

we developed

the

have known it

in

recent years.
Although the tariff policies of other countries have a real bearing on our prosperity,
we shall not improve the situation by copying their mistakes. Were we in this country
utterly to disregard what is done abroad in
this respect; were we to lower our tariffs,
or, what would suit me better, abolish them,
and have a free course across our international border, the effect would be to reduce
the cost of living in this country and, more
important still, the cost of protection in this
country; so much so that those tariff-ridden
nations that surround us would be unable to
compete with us in foreign markets.
I have long held, and I have said so in
this house, that were we to clear away the
obstructions to trade between ourselves and
our great neighbours in the United States,
irrespective of what they might do-were we
to follow the old British principle which
made the empire so strong in the years
gone by, of allowing merchants to buy in the
cheapest market and sell in the dearest,
without interference by government officials
-were we to adopt that policy and allow our
great trading communities complete freedom
of trade, the city of Toronto, for instance,
would in a very short time be as great as
Chicago. Toronto has the location, it has
the resources, it has the people, it has everything except the power to trade freely over
this entire continent. Toronto-that municipality which has advocated tariffs most consistently-is, I think, the municipality which
suffers most through their retention and
would benefit most by their abolition.
However, it takes a long time to recognize
things of this kind. As one listens to the
magnificent addresses delivered in this Senate chamber, one wonders why this hoary old
fallacy of protection hangs on. But the
reason, after all, is obvious. We have been
calling it very polite names. We speak of
pressure groups-private interests influencing
by their operations the machinery of government. Sometimes the little finger of the
banker or the big industrial interest is thicker
than the loins of the whole Canadian people
expressed in terms of governmental matters.
So far as our relations with other nations
are concerned, freedom of trade is the very
lifeblood of goodwill. Some person has
stated, in a striking phrase, what is almost
axiomatic, that "if trade cannot pass your
international borders, armies will". The way
to understand another nation is to do business
with it; and one of the chief reasons why
relations between Canada and the United
States are so good today is the freedom with

which, notwithstanding tariff barriers, we do
business with them. The vast interests which
the

people

of

ti

Uited

States

hold

in

Canada are our greatest guarantee of favourable legislation from the administration which
now rules in Washington.
I am for free trade. Somebody said that
free trade is a thing of the past. Well,
listening to the speeches and reading the
newspapers in recent years, one would think
so. But that is not so. The normal natural
condition is one of freedom, and the impractical theorist is he who thinks that nations
can lift themselves over the fence, in this
matter of trade, by their boot tops. In the
long run freedom will win. My honourable
friend from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan)
who re-stated these great principles in his
address, will find that more people agree
with him-particularly more of those who
think clearly and are well informed on these
subjects-than, perhaps, he imagines. The
time will come when protectionist fallacies
will be swept aside, and Canada will take
its place boldly among the nations of the
world, ready to trade with anybody, to do
business wherever we can make a profit, and
without the interference of government
officials in the matter.
I wish to express my high appreciation of
what has been said in this debate. It has
been an inspiring experience, something
which, in this chamber, I would hardly have
expected. I only wish that more people could
have listened to it.
Hon. A. Neil McLean: Honourable senators,
in closing the debate on the motion before
the house, I want to take the opportunity of
saying that I do not remember a debate
before this honourable body which has
brought out so many fine and well-thoughtout speeches. Those who have taken part,
one and all, have in my opinion made excellent contributions, which this bouse can well
be proud of. And when the committee gets
down to work and we are in a position to
hold hearings, I am sure those who come
before us to give their views will further
contribute greatly and help us in our undertakings. The idea that has been expressed
that our trade policies might be tied in closer
to our foreign policy, has a great deai of
merit and is well worth further exploration.
Trade and foreign policy, it would seem,
should go hand in hand.
The ground has been well covered and I do
not propose to say very much in review,
except to clarify further some of the points
I tried to put forward when the motion was
introduced, especially with regard to the convertibility of sterling. Possibly a better word
would be "exchangeability"; that is, making

FEBRUARY 26, 1953
the pound and dollar exchangeable at some
level, s0 that international trading can be
carried on freely between North America and
the sterling area. In other words, giving the
pound back to private enterprise. I becamne
used to the word "convertibility" when banking years ago, when convertibility meant
exchanging currency for gold under the old
gold standard of those days.
I agree with the honourable leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) that exchangeability must precede dollar investments in the
sterling area. I do flot need to remind honourable senators that the dollar has had many
ups and downs here in America. In the past
it has had its good times and bad Umxes--I
could quote several examples-although the
dollar has neyer carried the terrific load the
pound has been subjected to. The dollar
came back ultimately: and so, looking at history, and considering the real wealth of
resources behind sterling, I have every confidence that the pound will rîse again to be
a great and stable currency of the free world,
cippled as it is and without many friends in
some parts of the womld. The pound is even
now being used throughout the globe by
traders to a greater extent than the dollar.
A monetamy unit of that kind can't be held
down. In due course it is bound to be
stabilized and exchangeable at some level,
and the sooner the better for the sake of the
now divided free world. An exchangeable
dollar and pound would do more to unite
economically the two greatest territorial
trading units of the world than anything else
that could be done, and exchangeability
would add greatly to the strength of North
America and the Commonwealth. And, as
one of the outstanding members in another
place stated last week, stmength and unity is
the only hope of mankind.
It has been said that no one has explained
how sterling can be made interchangeable.
This could be one of the purposes of the
inquiry. We may get some further light on
the problem. It is not a matter which can
be solved satisfactorily by Great Britain
alone. Being mainly an international problem, it can be solved only through international economic co-operation.
After the first world war private enterprise played a big part in stabilizing the
pound. American and British bankers, headed
by J. P. Morgan & Co. and the Bank of
England, gave certain guarantees. Now, however, until the pound is turned back to private
enterprise, it is difficult for private enterprise
to take action. We hesitated in this country
for some time before turning our dollar back
to private enterprise. When we did, it
fluctuated somewhat, but it bas been a fairly

steady monetary unit sinýce being freed. Of
course, the vast amount of United* States
dollars coming into Canada for investment
helped us greatly in strengthening our dollar
reserves.
It may be Great Britain wlll think she
needs greater reserves or some kind of temnporary guarantees. If so, sbe has plenty of
collateral to put Up if necessary as f ar as
Canada is concerned. It may be that Great
Britain 'would like to be temporarily relieved
of some of her foreign war debts by having
them extended or otherwise. The last time
I looked. up the figures, about 25 per cent
of the United Kingdom's exports were
unrequited, as they had to go toward paying
off old war debts accumulated by the billions
during World War IL This seems to me to
be f ar too great a percentage, at least until
she gets on her feet financially. It is hard
to see how her people stand up under such
a burden. If part of these unrequited exports
could go to dollar areas, more dollars would
be earned. Raising the price of gold would
strengthen the reserves of all nations of the
free world and would give the commonwealth
many more millions of purchasing power. The
honourable leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) stated:
I say ernphatlcally we must find a solution for
the serjous world trade problems facing us today.
Well, the non-interchangeability of currency
as between the two greatest trading territorial
units of the free world is one of the important
problems facing us. And it has to be solved,
for it is holding up a vast amnount of trade,
development of resources and investments,
and these are the things that give nations
strength and prosperity. The trade is there
to be had. The man who filîs more pages
in modemn history than anyone else, says the
British were a great nation of shopkeepers
and traders; and we know wherever their
fiag bas been raised over the world, the firsi
thing done was to institute good commercial
laws to protect the honesty and integrity o!
trading.
I noticed an editorial in the New York
Times of February 20 that has an indirect
bearing on NATO, and I would like to put
it on record. It is headed "'Hungry Korean
Soldiers" and reads as follows:
One of the questions that many Americans will
wish to put to General Van Fleet concerns the disturbing reporta of malnutrition in the South
Korean Arniy. Dispatches to this newspaper indicate that hunger is a major cause of hospitalisation and it is established that some combat units
are staying at the front with a ration of three
handfuls of rice a day. The welfare of these
troops is close to General Van Fleet's heart and
he can possibly suggest the best courses to cope
with this situation.

SENATE
The matter is of concern on humanitarian
grounds. Our splendid allies should not be allowed
to suffer if we can prevent it. It is also important
on military grounds. The fiction that any Asian
can work and fight "on a handful of rice a day"
bas long since been exploded. A hungry soldier
is not a good soldier and a man who is hospitalized for malnutrition has certainly no value on the
fighting line. Moreover, diet deficiency is a prime
invitation to the spread of tuberculosis, and this
plague is going hand in hand with the short
rations among the Korean troops.
In this case the problem is not just one of
calories. The diet lack is largely a matter of
deficient supplies of proteins. The Koreans are
not getting enough meat and fish to go with the
rice. This, in turn, is partly a matter of money
deficiency on the part of the Korean governmentwhich pays for its troops' rations-and partly a
matter of difficulties of procurement and supply.
The organization of the Korean forces has been
rapid and the whole basis for services is not yet
adequate.
At a time when we are attaching increased
importance to the role that Asian troops must play
in the defence of Asia we cannot afford to be
callous toward a problem of this sort. It may be
that specific funds will have to be advanced to
the Korean government, earmarked for the feeding of troops. It may be that we shall have to do
a bigger technical job in procurement on behalf of
the Koreans and in the supervision of distribution.
General Van Fleet should have some sound ideas
about where effort can be expended to good
advantage and be should be questioned on this
point.

and in the meantime soldiers from NATO
countries seem to be suffering far more than
thcir shar of the casualties After :l, the
fighting is in the home country of the Korean
soldiers and they should form a strong front
line of defence. Possibly if we gave Southern
Korea some economic aid, consisting of surplus foods, their soldiers would have more
energy to stand up and fight for their country,
and the casualties falling on the NATO
nations might be somewhat minimized.
In closing I would like to quote a sentence
from Governor Adlai Stevenson's speech in
New York a few days ago:
For we of the NATO countries and the other
free nations are bonded together, once and for all,
in sickness or health, till-or rather-est atomic
death us do part.

CURLING CHAMPIONSHIP

FELICITATIONS TO COMPETITORS

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I wish to inform, the house that I had the
pleasure and honour of attend-ing the most
exciting play ever staged for the curling
chaýmpionship of Canada since the competition was inaugurated, twenty-seven years
ago. I do not say that better individual rinks
have not participated in the competition in
the past, but the general quality of the curling this year was the best ever witnessed.
I should like to congratulate particularly
the members of the Quebec rink. This was
really the first great showing ever made
by a rink frorn that province in the national
contest. Up until the final game between
Quebec and Saskatchewan, the Quebec rink
was heading for the titie, havin-g lost only
one gaine in. regular play. Its nearest coinpetitor was the Manitoba rink, which. had
lost two games. However, Quebec had a
littie bit of bad luck and lost its final gaine
to Saskatchewan. This forced. a play-off
between the Manitoba and Quebec rinks, and
thus gave Manitoba another chance for the
championship.
It was the third year of participation by
Newfoundland rinks, and the playing of their
individual curlers was the best they have
yet exhibited. They still have to iearn a good

provinces also were ably represented.
I will close with one more word. I neyer
was any prouder in my if e to be a Canadian

than when I saw -those eleven rinks step out
-two representing Ontario, and one each
from every other province; and if you had
been there, honourable senators, you would
have feUt the saine as I did. We need have
no fear for the future of our people so long
as Canadians step on the ice and curi as
th-ose gentlemen did. And they were ail young
-only -one, I think, was -over forty-five. They
were fine fellows, a real credit to Canada
and to our great national gaine.
Somne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I think this is an appropriate time for me to mention a fact to, many
honourable senators who, perhaps, have
scarcely heard of the town of Blaine Lake.
That fine littie community bas the distinction
of having had four of its high school girls
play in ail the bonspiels throughout the
province of Saskatchewan without a single
defeat. In their honour the town gave thein
a banquet and a presentation. Our high
school boys also made a fine showing in
curling circles, having suffered only one
defeat, and that by Ontario.
I have known the parents of these young
people throughout their married lives. Nýow
their children, by their success in curling
competitions, have brought distinction to
Blaine Lake and to the province *of Saskatchewan as well.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
BUSINESS 0F THE SENATE
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I amn indebted to the two honourable
senators who have just spoken and thereby
provided some discussion in the bouse
tonight. As will be noted from. our blank
order paper, I arn in the unhappy position
of being ýunable to place any business before
the bouse.
For reasons which they no doubt consider
good and sufficient, honourable members of
another place, while we were in recess, spent
a large part of the time discussing the budget,
alternately extolling its virtues and spreading
doubt as to its effect on the welfare of the
country. In their anxiety to review the
budget they have omitted to attend to any
legislation, and so we have nothing frorn
them awaiting our consideration.
In the early part of the session ail the
legislatîve measures thaýt could be dealt with

On the other hand, there is a good deal
of business before ýour standing committees,

and while it is receiving consideration I shall
do my utrnost to see that any measures available for study by the Senate are expeditious1y

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. A. L. Beaubien (for Hon. Mr.
McKeen) moved the second reading of Bill
R-9, an Act to incorporate Merit Plan Insurance Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
bill to incorporate an insurance company with
a capital of $1 million. The head office of
the company will be in the city of Montreal.
The applicants seek power to transact the
twenty-six various classes of insurance set
out in section 6 of the bill. These are the
classes of insurance usually provided for in
bills of this kind. By section 7 the company
is prohibited from commencing business
until at least $250,000 of its capital stock
has been subscribed and paid for. Thereafter
it can engage only in the class of insurance
mentioned in subsection (1) of section 7.

If the company is to engage in classes of
insurance other than those specified in subsection (1> ai section 7, additional amounts
of capital must be subscribed and paid, and
the details as to these additional amounts
and classes are set out in subsection (2) of
this section. Subsection (3) requires the company to increase its paid capital and surplus
periodically if it is engaged in the business
of fire insurance.
All these provisions, and others with which
I think I need not deal in detail now, have
been approved by the Superintendent of

reading today I will move that it be referred
to the Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I notice that the word
"Merit" appears in the name of the company.
Does this signify any departure from the
ordinary purposes of insurance companies?
Does this company in any important principle differ from others engaged in insurance
business?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I do not think so, otherwise the bill would not have been approved
by the Superintendent of Insurance.
Hon. Mr. Euler: It might.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Any company which
does business in a business way possesses a
lot of "merit"!
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

I move that the bill be referred to the

The motion was agreed to.

My relations with the leader of the governrnent in this house have always been

Senate that we have to sit day after day
waiting for long political debates in the
other house to finish. The rules should be
revîsed in sorne way so as to keep legisiation
corning before us.
I suggest that by early next week the leader
of the governrnent be prepared to inforrn us
as to the future sittings of this house. If he
tells us that we are to sit five days a week

Han. Mr. Robert son: I arn eritirely sympathetic with the rernarks of the honourable
leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig). I have
consistently expedited ahl legislation which
could properly corne before the Senate, and
have not required the house to sit any longer
than necessary.
As already stated, some irnportant rnatters
are to bc~ considered by certain standing cornmittees next week. On Tuesday, the Banking and Commrerce Cornrittee will continue
its study of the Trade Marks Bill, and on

Wednesday the Canadian Trade Relations
Cornmittee will take up the question of inter~~toatrade. What the prograr wil 1,e for
Thursday I cannot at the mornent say. As
to the week after next, experience tells me
that there should by that tirne he some legislation before us; and as we shahl then be near
the end of March, it will be necessary to
deal with the question of supply.
It would now appear that the Senate will
prohahly not adjourn rnuch earlier than the
H-ouse of Commons for the Easter recess, but
the prospects are that we rnay return a week
later than that house. It must he renernbered that if parliarnent is to prorogue early
in May, as is now generally expected, at
sorne stage sorne serious consideration mnust
be given to legisiation; and if we do adjourn
for a week longer than the House of Cornmons we shahl not he corning back here until
the mniddle of April.
For one reason or another, I think our
recess will not hegin until the Wednesday or
Thursday before Easter, and the onhy question is when the recess should end.

from Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon) in welcoming these students from St. Catharines today.
Perhaps I may be allowed to say to them on
behalf of the Senate that if there is little

because of the fact that the House of Commons has not been sending any to us lately.

TOUR OF SCHOOL CHILDREN
VISIT TO THÉ SENATE

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. J. Gray Turgeon: Honourable senators, about a month ago I had the great
honour of addressing the students of St.
Catharines Collegiate Institute and Vocational High School on the Senate and its
work. Some weeks later the honourable
gentleman who represents Lake Centre in
the other house spoke to them on another
subject. At the present time some 200 of
these students are visiting Ottawa. Many of
the girls are now sitting in the Senate
gallery, while most of the boys are enjoying
a flight over the city.
For nearly an hour before the house met
yesterday afternoon the Clerk of the Senate
assisted me in answering questions fired by
these young people, who have been studying
parliamentary procedure for three years.
Their very visit here is one result of our
British democratic system, which permits
absolute freedom of movement to our people.
The students are on tour under the guidance of their principal, Dr. Price, who is not
here at the moment but was with us yesterday. Among the group I observe Mr. and
Mrs. H. P. Cavers. Mr. Cavers, the honourable member for Lincoln in the House of
Commons, resides at St. Catharines.
I could not close without calling to your
attention a fact of which you are ail aware,
that the late and deeply lamented Senator
Joe Bench, who did such splendid service
for Canada in this house and outside of it,
was himself a resident of St. Catharines.
His widow and daughter are still living there,
as is his sister, and I know that today they
are ail thinking of this visit of their fellow
citizens to Ottawa.
On behalf of honourable senators I should
like to express our feeling that it is not only
a great pleasure but an honour to have a

Hon. Mr. King: My information is that it
was $470 million. I think that figure will
stand up, but I should like to check it. However, I maintain that even this is too small
an amount for the investment that Canada
has made in its national parks. It is my hope
that facilities provided by the federal, provincial, and municipal governments, together
with tourist associations, will soon result in
a tourist industry to the value of some $500
million or $600 million.
I have in my hand a list of the national
parks in Canada. Those of us who have
lived in the West for a long time know that
large areas, particularly in Alberta, were set
aside for park purposes many years ago.
The Banff National park, with an area of
some 2,564 square miles, was established in
1885; and the Waterton Lakes park, of 204
square miles, in 1895. Alberta was constituted as a province in 1905, and two years
later Jasper park, containing 4,200 square
miles, was created. The Wood Buffalo park,
of 17,300 square miles, was established in
1922. These areas are being maintained in
their virgin state, giving protection to the
timber, the watershed, the game and the
resources of Alberta for the use of Canadians
of today and the future.
Canada has set aside 29,147 square miles in
all for park purposes. This is something
which should be of great interest to the
members of this chamber and to Canadians
generally. I do not think that we, as parliamentarians, have made as much of our park
resources as we should have. Nor do I believe
that Canadians in general realize the opportunities and advantages which these resources
present to us. Long before Western Canada
was settled as it is today large tracts of land
were isolated for park purposes. This action
has proven beneficial to all Canadians, which
is a fact that should be remembered when
our people are discussing interprovincial
problems.
Today every province in Canada except
Newfoundland has a national park, and
some steps are being taken to remedy this
deficiency in our newest province. At Corner
Brook the Historic Society has erected tablets
which should help to attract tourists to the
island.
I have no doubt that through
co-operation of the government of the province with the federal government, parks will
soon be established in Newfoundland.
I have had occasion to visit a number of
parks. One of the newer ones is Fundy,

situated at the head of the Bay of Fundy, in
New Brunswick. It is only a small park, of
seven square miles, but it has a beautiIul
location, in the vicinity of the city of Saint
John and other nearby municipalities. Its
establishment is in line with the desire and
policy of the federal government to have
parks established in every province that
wishes to co-operate in developing them. I
am sure that this small park, situated as it
is, will be of great advantage to the province
of New Brunswick.
The Canadian Government Travel Bureau
was established in 1932. Previous to that
date the development of parks and the
advertising of parks reserves was left to the
Parks Branch. It is to the great credit and,
I think, the honour of the senior senator
from Halifax (Hon. Mr. Dennis) that in 1932
he suggested that our parks and tourist business could be greatly increased by the
establishment of a travel bureau. That year
parliament appropriated $100,000 for the
bureau's use, and the appropriation at present
is $1,529,000. The bureau now has eighty
employees. Have they justified their employment? From the information that we were
given the other day I would take it that they
have. In 1935 there were 26,500 inquiries from
people thinking of coming to Canada as
tourists. The number of inquiries last year
was more than 294,000. Now, inquiries mean
not only letters, but telegrams, personal interviews, telephone calls, and so on. We were
informed the other day, and I think truthfully informed, that every inquiry has been
answered.
Last year the bureau had a very difficult
problem because of the discount on American
money. Heretofore Canadians who have gone
to the United States have had to adjust their
money to American currency, sometimes by
paying a very large premium for United
States funds. I remember that on one occasion, on my travels to the coast, I went in to
the Great Northern Railway Office at
Spokane to buy a ticket, and the exchange
on Canadian money was 20 per cent. This
year, owing to conditions that have developed
in Canada, our money became of greater
value, and the ordinary American who is not
in business, who travels just for pleasure,
was amazed when he arrived in Canada to
find that the United States dollar had a lower
value here than the Canadian dollar. The
bureau, I think very wisely, advised inquirers
to buy Canadian money before coming into
Canada, but that if they failed to do so they
should go to the banks when in this country
in order to be sure of getting a fair exchange
of currency. The bureau-again very wisely,
I think-got in touch with the various tourist

MARCH 24, 1953
associations, advising them of the necessity of
treating Americans more or less kindly, suggesting that when the exchange was only
2 per cent their money should be accepted
at par. It was only when the rate went to
4 and 5 per cent that our merchants and
people in the tourist trade began to charge
the amount that was due them. Much correspondence took place, and the report we
had the other day indicated that a soft word
here and there, and courtesy by those
engaged in the tourist traffic, dissipated much
of the criticism that otherwise might have
been made.
The travel bureau is this year conducting
a series of radio broadcasts in an effort to
induce Canadians to travel in Canada. We
know that the great distances make it difficult for people of the maritimes to visit
British Columbia, that it is much easier for
them to visit the New England States. I
believe that the use of radio broadcasts is
wise, that they will induce many Canadians
to visit friends and resorts in Canada rather
than travel to the United States. The bureau
has told us that United States authorities urge
the people throughout the length and breadth
of their land to visit different parts of their
own country. As a result, we get only the
overflow of the American tourist traffic; but
if we go about it properly, that overflow
can be increased.
Some indication of the growth in popularity
of our national parks and of the great potentialities in this direction is to be found in
the fact that the number of visitors to park
areas increased from 415,000 in 1932 to
2,548,000 last year. That substantial increase
is in keeping with the tremendous development of Canada in general today. Our great
parks are widely separated, and until
recent years the only means of transportation
has been by rail. Now the Canadian government, under an agreement with the provincial governments, is building a highway
from the Atlantic to the Pacific. It will
follow certain channels of traffic through the
various provinces, an arrangement which I
think has been accepted by the provinces.
No one can foretell what effect the completion of a modern Trans-Canada highway will
have upon the tourist trafflc of this country.
My own feeling, based on experience, is that
the cost of the Trans-Canada highway should
have been borne entirely by the federal
government. This national highway, planned
with a view to the future development of
Canada, should be designed and maintained
for the benefit and advantage of all the
people, just as our national railway system
has been. The need for the establishment of
airways in Canada and recent expenditures
required for defence have I think precluded

any consideration of the construction of an
all-Canadian highway owned and controlled
by the federal government. I have always
felt that such a highway should be planned
and built, and that from it should run branch
highways to the centres of population and to
the great park areas. In that way we would
have some uniformity in the handling and
regulation of traffic in Canada. The federal
authorities should be in a position to regulate
traffic, control the weight of loads, and so
on, over such a highway from coast to coast.
Today the provinces have trunk, secondary
and third-rate roads, but these do not meet
prevailing conditions. The time will come
when there will be not only one trunk highway across Canada, but two or three highways. At the present time the federal and
provincial governments are undertaking a
highway from Calgary, through the park area
to Kamloops and on to the coast; and in that
settled portion of the Kootenay country, in
southern British Columbia, there will shortly
be a second highway to the coast. There is
now a highway between Edmonton and
Kamloops, serving a highly developed area.
The total appropriation for park purposes
this year was $6,856,000, and out of this sum
the expenditure on roads, camp sites, and so
on, amounted to $2,197,000.
Taking into
account the value of our capital investment
in parks and the possibilities of the tourist
trade, I think it is clear that if the federal
government is to reap adequate benefits from
its capital expenditures it will have to spend
mueh more on the roads approaching the
parks and within the park areas.
I have here two statements. One is entitled
"The National Parks of Canada, their location
and area", and indicates the acreage in each
province. The other is a comparative statement of the number of visitors to the parks
in the years 1951 and 1952. If permitted, I
should like to place these on the record.
Some Hon. Senators: Agreed.
See appendix at end of today's report.
Hon. Mr. King: I do not wish to detain the
Senate any longer, but I would repeat that
in our national parks we have a resource to
which we are not giving the attention it
deserves. One reads of the large revenues
derived by the government from pulp and
paper, from mining, and from agriculture;
and the minister has informed us that the
current productivity of Canadian labour is
equal to some $22 billion. I should like to
see a real effort made to develop the use of
the national parks, because I believe that,
properly handled, they will yield returns
equal to those of either the pulp and paper or
the mining industry, and the parks subtract
nothing from the wealth of any province.

SENATE
People can enjoy the amenities of the parks,
pay their money. and go away leaving our
scenery and our resources intact. We should
give much more consideration to this matter,
and impress upon our people in the various
provinces that not only should they visit
their local parks, but easterners should go
west and see for themselves the beauty and
greatness of the parks in southern Alberta
and the Rockies, and westerners should
go east and enjoy the amenities of our parks
in that section of the country.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I intend to avail myself of this opportunity
to make a few remarks, but I shall not take
long. Like the honourable senator from
Kootenay East (Hon. Mr. King), I do not
believe that Canadians are doing everything
they should and could do to encourage tourist
traffic. Pulp and paper, minerals and oil are
diminishing resources, but the growth of
tourist traffie will mean nothing but gain;
the greater the success this year, the more
the success that is likely to be reaped in
years to come. That is one good reason why in
this matter every Canadian should, if possible, become an ambassador of good will;
in commending these resources to our neighbours he is making a friendly and appreciated
gesture.
Some remarks of mine in committee may
have been misunderstood as implying a personal complaint about the quality or the
prices of meals on our railroads. But that
was not the point I had in mind. I myself
may be willing to pay these charges, and I
will admit that the fare provided is good
enough for me; but I am alarmed at the
possible effects on the tourist trade. I have
been on Canadian trains with Americans
whose comments were rather bitter; they said
they could get much better meals on the
trains in their own country, and I recall
one who refused to use the dining-car for the
last meal before his arrival at Vancouver.
Recently, without any justification, prices of
meals on our dining-cars have been increased
40 per cent. I recall a man who, with his
wife and two little children, came into the
diner for supper and was charged $8.50. The
head waiter remarked, "I know these people
cannot afford to pay that much, but we do
not set the charges on our menus."
And this increase has been made at a time
when the price of practically every article
of food is falling, and falling rather rapidly.
For instance, I noticed in a Manitoba paper
lately that the price of cream ranges from
60 cents per pound for table grade to 48 cents
for No. 2. A pound of cream is equivalent
to about one and one-fifth pounds of butter.
Then, grade A-1 eggs are selling at 40 cents
per dozen, while the C-1 grade is down to

19 cents per dozen; yet the price of one egg
to a traveller on a dining-car is 55 cents. This
statement applies Lu buth railways, for they
are in agreement not only on prices, but on
the meals they serve. Recently I had a
letter from a man in Montreal who said, after
an experience of travelling a great deal on
both Canadian and United States railroads in
the past ten years, that the price he was
required to pay for a breakfast on the road
between Toronto and Montreal was the highest
ever charged to him by any railroad.
As for beef, it seems that roast beef has
disappeared from the menus of our railways.
What specialty do we offer? In the United
States, particularly in the south, they
specialize in fried chicken, and their technique in this line is simply wonderful. Why
should we not select some dish as being
distinctively Canadian? The people of Quebec,
growing peas on clay soil, have made quite
a reputation with their pea soup. At the
very least, travelling Canadians should not
be deprived of beef, especially now that it is
available in almost any amount. I saw an
article in the Montreal Gazette which
reported, under the heading "Use School
Lunches to aid Beef Prices", the purchase by
Washington of unspecified quantities of beef
under "a government-sponsored school lunch
program, in a move to bolster sagging cattle
prices".
Sometimes you cannot buy a beef dinner
in Canada, and when you -can it costs about
$3. What effect do you think this will have
on American tourists coming to Canada?
About a year ago I made a trip to Long
Beach, California. I travelled on a splendid
train whose coaches, suspended on springs,
gave you the impression that you were riding in a luxurious automobile. I was struck
by the fact that everyone handling my baggage and so on seemed intent on trying to
make my trip enjoyable. The train was
equipped with a loud-speaker system over
which was announced, as we went along,
the names of the chief places of interest and
I recall
general information about them.
that once when having passed over a bridge
we were told to look down and see the
tunnel which we had come through a little
while before. When the trip was ending
someone expressed the hope over the loudspeaker that we had had a good journey and
would take it again. The people concerned
with the tourist industry in Long Beach take
every step to make your holiday a pleasant
and memorable occasion. All sorts of games
and places of amusement are provided, and
tourists are given every consideration. I
think the tourist traffic authorities in Canada
would be well advised to take a lesson from
these people in Long Beach as to how to

MARCH 24, 1953
develop the tourist trade. Canadians do not
give enough thought to this.
I recently took a trip to Washington, D.C.,
via the New Jersey turnpike, returning by
the western border of Iowa and the Pennsylvania turnpike. It costs the driver of an
automobile a cent a mile to travel along these
roads, and I am sure the toll produces a great
deal of revenue for the states through which
these highways run. When you enter a
turnpike you are given a card with the time
and place of entry stamped on it; and when
you leave the turnpike the number of miles
you have travelled are calculated and you
pay accordingly. Restaurant and gas station concessions are granted along these
roads. A number of articles have recently
appeared in magazines and newspapers
about the beautiful Howard Johnson restaurants along the Pennsylvania turnpike.
When coming to one of these restaurants
you are notified by a sign. If you intend to
stop you turn off on a side road which runs
parallel to the turnpike for a distance of
about a half a mile before reaching the restaurant. When leaving, there is another
half-mile stretch of road which leads back
onto the main highway. The restaurants
are -attractively designed and serve tasty
meals for as little as one dollar. They also
sell souvenirs for the convenience of the
tourist.
I have found that the hotel charges in the
United States are just about half what they
are in Canada. As a matter of fact, at the
start of my trip to Washington I paid more
for accommodation in Gananoque, Ontario,
than I did anywhere during the rest of the
trip. In some restaurants in America you
can get a breakfast of two eggs, toast and
coffee for as little as 35 cents, but a similar
meal in Canada would cost at least 70 cents.
I would point out, too, that it is the custom
in most American restaurants to refll your
cup with coffee for no extra charge.
Many Americans want to visit the capital
of Canada and would like to stay at the
Chateau Laurier while here. But just how
do they find their way to that hotel? By the
time they make their way around "confusion
square" they may end up in Aylmer, Quebec.
For instance, in order to get to the Chateau
from the Parliament buildings they must
travel around the most congested part of the
city.
They have to drive by the War
Memorial, go down Rideau street for several
blocks, swing around by the market, back up
to Rideau and then to the hotel.
If I were the head of the Canadian National
Railways system I would add at least 150
rooms to the west end of the Chateau Laurier.
This could be done wi thout detracting in any

way from the appearance of the building.
That huge promenade on the west side of the
hotel, where they used to hold pink teas, has
not been used at all in recent years. This
area could be earning from $50 to $100 a day
as a parking lot. Then the city traffic officials
could shave a little bit off "confusion square"
and put up a sign directing traffic going to
the hotel to turn left onto this promenade.
Tourists could then unload their baggage in
comfort, instead of having to park at some
garage in lower town and be forced to carry
their luggage all the way to the Chateau. An
outlet could also be made from the back of
the promenade to Major's Hill Park. At the
present time it is easy enough for people to
leave the Chateau, but it certainly is difficult
for them to get to it. Many honourable senators have visited the Empress hotel in
Victoria, B.C. Just compare that hotel with
the Chateau. While the recent addition to
the Empress hotel did not add to the beauty
of the building, it certainly provided more
accommodation. The Empress hotel, like the
Chateau, has plenty of rooms for the holding
of banquets and so on; but, unlike the
Chateau, it is so located that motorists can
approach it from either direction and drive
right up to its main door.
The honourable senator from Kootenay East
(Hon. Mr. King) has spoken to the house about
our wonderful national parks. I have been
amazed at the number of people who have
visited Riding Mountain Park in Manitoba.
The number has been increasing each year,
and I think the peak was reached last summer. Good business practices by a tourist
resort one year will produce better business
in the following year. That is what is happening in the Prince Albert National Park
in Saskatchewan, where they have constructed new buildings and built a road
through to Montreal Lake. This huge lake
is dotted with many islands, and provides
plenty of good fishing.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Are you not referring to
Lac la Ronge?
Hon. Mr. Horner: No, Montreal Lake. Both
these lakes provide good fishing. I have been
told by people who travel around a good deal
that perhaps one of the best golf courses in
the world is to be found in that area.
In the development of tourist trade I see no
justification for the railways not co-operating
with the rest of the Canadian people. Our
hotels also could co-operate, as in fact every
Canadian could. It is not only food that is
important to visitors: like all other people,
they greatly appreciate courteous treatment.
That is the least costly thing of all that can
be accorded to people visiting our country,

THE SENATE
Wednssday, March 25, 1953
The Senate met at 3 p.rn., the Acting
Speaker (Hon. J. H. King, P.C.) in the Chair.
Prayers and routine proceedings.
THE LATE QUEEN MARY
ADDRESS EXPRESSING SORROW TO RER
MAJESTY QUEEN ELIZABETH 11
Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson: Honourable

senators, I arn sure that it is the unanimous
wish of the house that we should take the
earliest opportunity of expressing to Her
Majesty and members of the Royal Farnily
our deep sorrow upon the passing of lier late
Mai esty Queen Mary. Therefore, with the
leave of the Senate I move, seconded by the
honourable the leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig):
Resolved, That an humble Address be presenited
to Her Majesty the Queen in the following words:
To the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty:
Most Gracious Sovereign:
We, Your Majesty's dutiful and loyal subjects
the Senate of Canada, in pariament assembled.,
approach Your Majesty with the expression of our
deep and heartfelt sorrow at the demise of Her
Mai esty Queen Mary.
We mourn the loss of Her Mai esty, whose kindness. graciousness and great influence for good over
so many years won the respect and admiration
of us all; and there has corne to each of us a
sense of personal bereavement whlch-we say it
with aIl possible respect and duty-makes Your
Mai esty's sorrow our own.
We pray that the God of consolation may comfort Your Mai esty and the members of the Royl
Famlly in your bereavement. and that Your Majesty
may be long spared to continue the eminent public
services of your great predecessors.

The late Queen, whose life encompassed
nearly a century, witnessed vast changes ini
the warld's political and economic development; and it was in no smail part due to her
ceaseless devotion to duty and high example
that the British monarchy stood firm as a
rock whule many other monarchies were
swept away in the storms which engulfed
hurnanity during two world wars.
The caîl to that duty came to lier early in
life, and it was not long after her coronation
that the first great war broke upon the
world. During the anxious years of that
war she made tireless rounds of hospitals
and service centres, assisting here, encouraging there. Upon the death of her beloved
husband, which was a grievous blow, she
re-affirmed her intention to serve her country and people to the end in these words:
Although he will no longer be at my slde-and
no words can tell how much I misa him-I trust
that with God's help I may still be able to continue some part ai least of the service which. we
tried to give to this great land and Empire.

And that goal was adhieved. WTho could
surpass the courage and bravery of lier late
Mai esty in refusing to leave England, or even
London, during the blitzkrieg of the Second
World War, her Spartan observance of the
restrictions demanded of her people in their
island fortress during those anxious years,
lier conscientious efforts in the cause of
victory?
Nor was her late Mai esty's 111e untoudhed
by sorrow. Her great loss in her husband's
death, and the distressing period of her
eldest son's abdication, subi ected her to heavy
strain; but the severest blow of her life came
with the death of aur late beloved sovereign
George VI. Few can forget the touching

SENATE
We mourn today a gracious and good
Queen who has entered into a well-earned
rest, and whose memory will ever be cherished by men and women of good will in all
quarters of the world.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I do not feel I should speak at length at
this time. I would not want anything I
might say to detract from the able expression of the feelings of this house by the honourable leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Robertson).
Every citizen of Canada today feels that in
the paissing of the Dowager Queen he has
lost a member of his family. The late Queen
was a shining example to the women of our
country of what a wife and mother ought
to be. Her life was the outstanding instance
of the effect of one woman on the history of
Great Britain. She showed the women of
the Commonwealth what is possible to be
accomplished in one lifetime. She bore much
sorrow through the years, but the service
she rendered will always remain alive in the
minds of her people.
Quite a few honourable senators will no
doubt remember when, in the spring of 1901,
the late Queen, accompanied by her husband,
then the Duke of York and later King George
V, paid ber first visit to Canada. In my part
of the country they opened the first of the
Manitoba University buildings. We students
stood around, and, having read of kingship
in history, considered it a great occasion to
see for the first time royalty in the flesh.
Even at that early date, when I was more a
student than anything else, I had the feeling
that the royal lady was the kind of person
royalty should be. She carried herself regally,
and, without any effort, or any "side", gave the
impression that she was really a great woman
and some day would be a great queen. Our
expectation was more than fulfilled.
I join with the leader of the government
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) in expressing to Her
Majesty Queen Elizabeth II the sincere sympathy, not only of this house but, I believe, of
all the people of Canada in the great loss she
has suffered. In surveying the world vista
which lies before lier, Her Mrajesty has the
great advantage of being able to derive from
the example of ber grandmother an inspiration which will stand her in good stead on
every occasion that may arise in ber lifetime.
I associate myself with the government
leader in sending to Her Majesty Queen
Elizabeth II our kindest condolences and our
desire that in ber sorrow, and the sorrow of
her husband, her children, and the other
members of the Royal Family, they may
know that we Canadians are thinking about

them as if they were members of our own
families.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators,
fifty years ago, in 1901, the children of my
age witnessed the visit to Montreal of the
then Duke and Duchess of York. We were
all shouting "Vivent nos futurs Souverains""Long Live our future King and Queen."
Thousands and thousands of people acclaimed
our distinguished visitors as they passed
through our streets. It was our first glimpse
of royalty.
Today we mourn the loss of our beloved
Queen Mary. Her sense of dignity and of
duty made her very dear to all the citizens of
the ýcommonwealth. She was truly a royal
great-grandmother.
Very simply but very
sincerely we pay our tribute of respect and
of admiration to a grand lady whose name
will always be remembered with gratitude
and emotion. She was a perfect example of
constant service to lier country and to the
commonwealth as a whole. Born in 1867, the
year of Confederation, she grew as Canada
was growing. From ber early youth she
always did the right thing at the right time
and in the right way. She lived eighty-five
years, and she never failed in her long and
arduous task. Her courage in her afflictions,
especially in war-time, was a source of inspiration to all lier people. She was a symbol of
devotion and sacrifice. The nobleness of her
character, ber dignified manners, and her
kindness assure forever to Queen Mary a
great place in history.
(Translation):
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable senators, it seems fitting that a voice from Quebec
should join in the words of sympathy which
both our leaders have expressed to the Queen
of England on the occasion of the grievous
loss which has just been sustained by the
British Empire as a whole. A moment ago
youthful memories were recalled.
I, too,
remember having seen the Dowager Queen at
Quebec in 1901, when she accompanied the
Duke of York. At that time we admired the
great dignity, moral strength and physical
beauty of ber who was one day to become
queen. In our schools, like the school children
of today, we spoke of the Grandmother of
our present gloriously reigning Queen. At
that time we loved to speak of the Duchess of
York. And if we remember ber today, it is
because she was a model of what a great
queen should be, because she was held in
veneration, because she had a lofty soul,
because throughout ber life she showed that
she had a great heart and because ber actions
were proportionately great. Inasmuch as she
was once a queen, let us, therefore say
"Long live the Queen".

TOURIST TRAFFIC
REPORT OF COMMITTEE-DEBATE

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Buchanan for the adoption of the report of
the Standing Committee on Tourist Traffic
recommending that the committee be authorized to print its proceedings.
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
I wish to confine my remarks to one phase of
the subject before the house, and to discuss
briefiy what has been done in Canada to
preserve and rebuild historie sites and monuments. This work has been going on for the
last thirty years, and has continued in such a
way that a real heritage will be passed on to
succeeding generations. The officers of the
department have been ably assisted in this
work by members of the Historie Sites and
Monuments Board of Canada. This is an
honorary board, made up of members living
in different provinces, and I wish to pay a
tribute to them for the interest they have
taken in the history of our land.
Every city and town in Canada, and a great
many villages as well, have erected memorials
to those gallant souls who made the supreme
sacrifice in World War I or World War II.
Some of these memorials are in the form of
monuments in bronze and stone; others are
public buildings-libraries, assembly halls, etc.
I know of one small town-Redcliff-which
could afford none of those things, but along
each side of a road leading into that town the
citizens erected a row of crosses, each cross
bearing the name of a soldier, and beside
each cross a tree has been planted.
These memorials will, of course, always
remain sacred. Aside from them altogether,
the board has investigated and weighed evidence surrounding more than a thousand
different sites, and have judged that some 300
of them are worthy of being marked and
maintained in the interests of Canada. Outstanding among those sites is the fortress of
Louisbourg, on Cape Breton Island. This old
fortress was built more than two centuries
ago. It was captured by the British in 1745,
returned to the French, later beseiged, and
after a long struggle was recaptured by the
British in 1758. A feature of that battle was
that one of the British divisions was led by
General Wolfe, who later died so heroically
in the battle of the Plains of Abraham. The
old fortress has been maintained, a museum
has been added to it, and visitors can walk
around its walls and reconstruct in imagination many of the stirring deeds of this historie fort.

Another site in the Maritimes which is of
special interest is at Fort Anne, in Annapolis
Royal. Before the Pilgrim Fathers landed ai,
Plymouth Rock there was a thriving village
at this place. One of the very first boats that
was ever built in America had its sails
unfurled there. Those shores also saw the
sad departure of some 1,600 Acadians who
were expelled from there by force in 1755.
That event was immortalized by Longfellow,
in the beautiful poem Evangeline. Countless
lovers of poetry have read that poem; a great
many have shed tears over it. Everyone who
is interested in the subject would be thrilled
to see the monument erected at Fort Anne
park and to visit some of the scenes in that
beautiful land of Evangeline.
New Brunswick has many important sites
and tourist attractions, a number of which
are marked. The ancient city of Saint John
is the scene of the reversible falls; the tidal
bore of the Bay of Fundy occurs at Moncton
and the magnetic hill is just outside that city.
One of the many historical monuments bears
an inscription that the United Empire Loyalists made their first landing in Canada there,
in 1783.
On Prince Edward Island there are a great
many scenes to attract the traveller, and a
number at Charlottetown are worthy of
special attention. There beside the parliament
buildings is a monument erected to commemorate the landing of Jacques Cartier in
1534. The Island has numerous spots of
great natural beauty which, once seen, will
linger long in the memory. Someone has
appropriately said:
White as the whitest lily of the stream
These tender memories are,
A fairy tale of some enchanted land we know
not where
But lovely as the landscape in a dream.

Those words apply to many lovely scenes
throughout Prince Edward Island and the
other provinces down by the sea.
In Quebec and Ontario the Historie Sites
and Monuments Board has located some 130
places which they consider to be of special
interest. Travelling along the roads of
Quebec, you will often see a small shrine
with a sacred image; there you will stop
your car, remove your hat and pay tribute
to the deep religious sentiments of the people
of the area. The places marked in Quebec
and Ontario range all the way from this type
of small shrine to the mighty Niagara, the
thunderous noise of whose falling water can
be heard for a long distance. And of course
one should not overlook the beauties of the
driveways and flowers in this capital city of
Ottawa.

MARCH 25, 1953
Travelling westward on the Trans-Canada
highway-which is rapidly being constructed
-you will be able to reach before long the
western provinces, with their particular western atmosphere, where the people are most
hospitable, neighbourly and whole-hearted.
In describing the people of this part of the
country someone has written:
Ask why the eagle flies in air
And builds on high his craggy nest;
Ask why the fishes swim so deep,
Then ask me why I love the West.
The western prairies have peculiarities of
their own. Sites that are marked in that
part of the country are not battle grounds
on which peoples of different races fought
for the possession of land. Those great areas
were obtained largely by peaceful penetration. Many places are marked in memory of
the activity of Christian missionaries; and
the ancient trading posts of the Hudson's
Bay Company and the rival Northwest Company are marked to commemorate the negotiations and treaties by which Canada
acquired that strange empire.
In the southern part of the prairie provinces one may visit the Cypress Hills, where
ranching first took place. It was among those
hills that Inspector Walsh, one of the early
inspectors of the Mounted Police, built Fort
Walsh, for the purpose of controlling the
roving bands of Indians who were often on
the warpath and often starving. Its purpose
also was to control the wolfers, whisky
smugglers and lawless men who drifted in
from the south. That fort has recently been
rebuilt, an exact copy of the fort of 1875.
Travelling westward along the trail which
is rapidly becoming a paved highway, you
will come next to a cairn erected at Cluny,
Alberta, to commemorate the signing of
Treaty No. 7, by which Canada obtained the
land from the warlike Black Feet Confederacy. Although that treaty was signed
back in 1877, one can still look at the great
valley and visualize the time when it was
covered with thousands of gaudy tents, when
at night dogs barked, children screamed and
the tom-toms were heard in the distance,
and when out on the hills bands of shaggy
buffalo could be seen. There today you can
see the hill where the lieutenant-governor
and Colonel McLeod stood, surrounded by
some eighty Northwest Mounted Police
dressed in their colourful uniforms of scarlet
and gold.
The beauties of the magnificent scenery of
Banff and Jasper need hardly be mentioned,
for they are famous the world over.
After you go through the pass to British
Columbia you will see cairns erected to the
honour of the early explorers. In Stanley

Park the scenery will amaze you. If you are
fortunate enough your guide will point out
the Siwash Rock, which marks the last resting
place of that gifted Indian maid, Pauline
Johnson, whose poetry will be read for many
years to come. She brought great honour to
her family and her tribe.
In many of the smaller districts of Canada
there are historical societies gathering relics
which indicate the way of life of the early
days. Many of the tourists to Canada are
said to be souvenir hunters, but of course
they cannot carry away these relics. If the
historical societies were encouraged to make
available pamphlets giving historical facts, I
believe many tourists would better appreciate
the people and the country they are visiting.
True, good roads, courteous service, welcome
signs and reasonable prices are essential
attractions; but if something of a historical
nature were given to visitors many of them
would make return trips to Canada.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. J. J. Duffus: Honour*4le senators, at
one time it was generally understood that
Canada had four basic industries: agriculture,
lumbering, fishing and mining. More recently,
however, it has seemed appropriate to say
that the tourist trade should be classed as
Canada's fifth industry. I am one of those
who have been sincerely interested in the
promotion of tourist traffic in the province of
Ontario. In fact, at one time I was vicepresident of the Ontario Tourist Association.
Consequently, anything relating to tourist
trade or travel in Ontario interests me very
much.
I desire to place on Hansard some information with respect to the rapid increase of the
tourist industry. That industry is interwoven
with agriculture and fishing: with fishing
not only on the Atlantic and Pacifie coasts
but around the province of Newfoundland;
with agriculture, throughout the province of
Ontario, where, also, fishing is a sport enjoyed
by many hundreds of thousands of people.
In the light of a revenue from the tourist
industry last year estimated at between $270
million and $280 million, and with a record
number of 26 million visitors to Canada,
everything points to these totals being continued if not surpassed in 1953. For their
part, Canadians are the greatest travellers in
the world, and when they travel they spend
more money per capita than tourists of any
other nation.
What is interesting and most encouraging
is that to date this year the number of
inquiries from potential visitors to Canada is
63 per cent higher than at the same time last
year. This fact is partly due to extensive

SENATE
advertising during 1952, at a cost of some
$998,000. Much of this program was directed
at the United States in the form of radio
programs publicizing Canadian national parks,
but the general idea was to encourage Canadians as well as Americans to see more of
our great country.
General H. A. Young, the Deputy Minister
of the Department of Resources and Development, stated that between April and December last year 2,548,870 persons visited Canada's
national and historic parks-a record number,
and an increase of 20 per cent over the
previous year. Halifax Citadel, on which
$100,000 was spent for renovation and repairs,
and the fortification walls in Quebec, repaired
at a cost of $20,000, attracted many tourists
who had not visited these places theretofore.
For their part, Canadians have shown a
continued interest in everything which pertains to the American continent.
Canadian merchants and others were very
generous, particularly during the first part of
the year, in accepting United States currency
at par. The Sifferential of four to five per
cent in favour of our dollar, although it
proved an encouragement to Americans, later
became quite a burden upon hotel-keepers,
business people and others, and it was found
necessary to discontinue to some extent this
courtesy.
Foreign vehicles entering Canada on
travellers' permits increased during February
of this year to 58,599, a 20 per cent advance
over the similar period last year. This is
ample evidence that the tourist business for
1953 is away to a booming start.
Entrances through ports in Ontario this
year have already risen to 28,598, from 25,862
last year. Other increases as reported are:
British Columbia, to 11,996 from 11,620;
Quebec, to 11,427 from 9,930; New Brunswick,
to 9,999 from 2,938; Alberta, to 664 from 596;
Saskatchewan, to 370 from 244; the Yukon
Territory, to 149 from 120. The Manitoba
figures, according to my information, show
some decline, from 1,103 to 539. Entries by
ship to ports in Newfoundland and Nova
Scotia rose in February from 80 to 126.
It is my conviction that, with the improvement of highways, the unprecedented expansion in our Canadian economy, and prosperity
generally in both Canada and the United
States, Ontario will be crowded with tourists
to an extent which will tax our accommodation to the limit. In my belief our tourist
trade in Ontario will double in the next two
or three years.
The city of Peterborough and the waters
adjacent thereto are considered to be one of
the most attractive tourist resorts in central

Canada. The city itself is a mecca for homeseeking citizens and manufacturing concerns.
It is blessed with low iaxatiou, ucap

lec-

trical power, fairly satisfactory labour conditions and attractive living surroundings. From
a tourist standpoint its main attraction lies
in the numerous winter and summer resorts
in the iimediate vicinity; and skiing, boating,
fishing and hunting facilities are right at the
door.
All of us are aware that the attractiveness
of a community is enhanced by the character
of its people and its institutions, and in that
regard Peterborough is supreme.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Duffus: Peterborough has more
than eighty-one industries, small and large,
of a diversified character.
The customs
receipts of the port are greater than they
have ever been. This, I think, is ample proof
of the prosperity which our industries and
businesses generally have enjoyed. Peterborough is the gateway to the great recreation area known as the Kawartha Lakes
district. which is visited by many thousands
of people each year. The Trent waterway,
considered to be among the most beautiful
of its kind in the world, also is in this
district.
Honourable senators, it is obvious that the
expenditure of tourist dollars is of great
value to our business people, hotels, restaurants and summer resorts, as well as to our
farmers and gardeners.
I should like to say a few words now about
the basic industry of agriculture which, all
senators will admit, forms the bedrock
foundation of stable prosperity. Farmers
have been the founders of civilization, and
agriculture is increasingly being honoured
with a place among sciences. It is a science
of necessity which has stood the test of time.
The weal or woe of our country depends
absolutely upon agriculture and our farmers.
Empires have risen and crumpled into dust
and various arts have been learned and forgotten, but agriculture has always survived.
Many nations owe their very life and progressive advancement to the character of their
agriculturists. Amid all the industrial skills
that have characterized nations, farming has
always held a distinguished position. In
primeval ages agriculture was the commodity
parent of traffic, and today it is still essential
for the promotion of trade in general, which
of course includes the tourist trade.
It is gratifying to know that on all vital
matters-in nearly all the supreme things of
life-the heart of the great nation to the
south beats with that of Canada. These two
countries hold common ideals, common
aspirations and common truths. Much of the

TOURIST TRAFFIC
REPORT OF COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Buchanan for adoption of the report of the
Standing Committee on Tourist Trafflc recommending that the committee be authorized to
print its proceedings.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, the
order for resumption of this debate stands in
the name of the honourable gentleman from
HalifaxHon. Mr. Quinn: Halifax-Dartmouth.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That only goes to show
that I am not as familiar with geography as
I should be. The honourable gentleman
from Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor) is
temporarily ill, and that is why I am taking
part in this debate a little sooner than I
otherwise would.
No member of this house need apologize
for participating in discussion on a subject of
so great importance as the one now before us.
I think the development of tourism-I use
this word which is now commonly employed
by those who are responsible for charting
our economies-is apparent to every one. In
a way, tourism is the export of the beauties
of our country. We encourage people from
all corners of the world to come and enjoy
our lakes, streams, mountains, prairies and
rivers and we want them to go away with a
sense of satisfaction after having spent substantial sums of money in our country. An
export of this character does not diminish.
When we export timber, pulp or paper we
are using up, for a time at any rate, a
natural resource. And of course when we

Traffic Committee were much impressed by
what were said to be the possibilities of
making our national parks much stronger
attractions for tourists.
If we are to encourage this great tourism
industry in Canada we must give attention
to a few things. Heading the list is good
roads. On this point I am bound to say that
in my thinking I have been somewhat at
variance with what is the popular notion in
Canada. But I may say, honourable senators,
that is not a new experience for me.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Canada needs good hardsurfaced roads, such as the Americans are
used to, leading from the international boundary into the more northerly country.
I recall vividly that when I presided over
the Department of Mines and Resources we
considered trying to attract tourists across
the international boundary south of Cranbrook and into the central part of British
Columbia. But to enjoy the beauties of
Banff, the national parks and radium hot
springs, they would have to journey over a
stretch of country known as the Skookumchuck prairies. Let me tell of my experience
on a trip over that part of the country. Not
only was the inside of the car completely
covered with dust, as was also the compartment in the rear where I had my luggage, but
when I opened my bag I had to shake the
dust out of my pyjamas before I could use
them.
Hon. Mr. Duff: What about your stomach?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: An experience of that
kind discourages travel in Canada. As a
matter of fact, by actual inquiry we learned
that hundreds of American tourists who
crossed the southern boundary of British
Columbia drove a few miles over the class
of road to which I have referred, and turned
back. I do not blame them. Good roads are
essential to comfortable travel. In my judgment they are more important, for the
moment, if we are to build up this great
industry of tourism with all its possibilities,
than is the development, important though
it may be, of the Trans-Canada highway. The
construction of good roads through the Maritime Provinces will bring hundreds of
thousands of tourists to those areas; and I
think similar results will follow the building
of good highways almost anywhere across
the country.
Another requirement of the first importance
is the provision of wholesome food, good service, and clean sleeping accommodation. We
have yet a long way to go in this direction.
Many of the people who are endeavouring
today, across Canada, to provide this kind of
68112-24j

service are inexperienced. They want to do
the best they can, but they need a substantial
increase in knowledge of how to go about it.
Our tourist bureau, in co-operation with the
various provincial bureaux, could usefully
pay some attention to this matten.
The last thing I will mention is courtesy.
I like the slogan which the late Sir Henry
Thornton inscribed on the bridges and buildings of the Canadian National Railways:
"Courtesy and Service". Courtesy and service
combined are a very important factor in giving enjoyment to our visitors and encouraging them to spend some of their money in
this country.
I shall not detain the house much longer.
I think all of us are very much indebted to
the honourable senator from Lethbridge
(Hon. Mr. Buchanan), the Chairman of the
committee, for the active interest he has
taken, not only this session but in previous
sessions, in the promotion of this important
industry of tourism. Its potentialities are
almost unlimited. I know a little bit, at any
rate, about the problems involved, and it is
my belief that if we go about this business
in an intelligent way the industry can be
made worth to us in ten years' time at least
$500 million annually.
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators,
I should like to add just a few words to the
very eloqent remarks which have just been
made by the honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar). He has pointed out
that Americans, when they come to Canada,
feel at home; and I may say that we have
the same feeling when we visit their country.
There is one point which I should like to
stress. The honourable senator who bas just
spoken has praised the beauty of the rivers,
lakes and mountains of good old Quebëc;
but may I say that American tourists come to
that province not only because they do not
encounter any language difficulty, but
because we can offer them something different. They like to become acquainted with our
French-Canadian culture-our art and our
handicrafts. Though the reference is of a
somewhat personal nature, I may mention
that my brother, Paul Gouin, is recognized
as having done excellent work to preserve for
Quebec what we call its figure francaiseits French characteristics.
Sometimes we are called "New France",
but as a matter of fact we are more a corner
of old France. Some forty years ago my
good friend du Roure, a professor from Paris
who was in charge of the French Department at McGill University, and who was
killed in the first world war, started the first
French summer school at McGill; and every
year there come to that good old university

SENATE

to study French a couple of thousand lady
t.nrhers from the United States. My own
Université de Montreal, though it took a long
time to do it, finally followed the lead of
McGill, and now on the other side of the
mountain we also have our French summer
school. Laval, in Quebec City, has its summer faculty. What interests me even more
is that our good friends from McMaster
University started at Trois Pistoles, some
twenty-five years ago a French colony;
students who go there and live with the
farmers at their homes. This development
has been an outstanding success from the
point of view of good neighborliness.
At Murray Bay, where I have been going
for more than fifty years, there is another
American colony. The late President Taft
may be termed the father of that colony.
He used to say Bonjour to all the farmers
and the good old women whom he passed
on the road from his bouse as he went down
the hill-and be was rather a heavyweightto the golf club which he founded, and on his
way back for lunch. I remember very well
having met him when I was just a little boy.
Senator Taft too has been coming to Murray
Bay from the time he was three years old.
It is, I believe, of much importance in the
promotion of good neighborliness that such
families as the Tafts and the Cabots have
been coming to Murray Bay for more than
half a ýcentury, and that for many of them
it has actually become their home. At the
end of the season there they say, for instance,
"We are leaving home to go to Boston for the
winter." They like all those things which are
characteristic of French Canada. They enjoy
our old churches, our folk songs and folk
dances, our homespun goods or, as we say in
French, l'étoffe du pays. Murray Bay is also a
meeting place for many of our friends from
Toronto and other English-speaking cities.
They come to French Canada to find something different.
I wanted to make these few remarks because, after all, French Canadian culture is
the heritage of all Canadians and not just
those of French origin. This heritage belongs
to all of us, just as does our parliamentary
system, which is of British origin. I believe
our French-Can.adian culture is a first-class
tourist attraction.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

tourist trade from that beautiful island of
Cape Breton to the west coast of Canada he
inadvertently pabsed &vcr another beautiful
island further to the east and left the impression that the Gulf of St. Lawrence separates
the province of Newfoundland from rather
than joins it to the rest of Canada.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Prat: I know the honourable
senator is a friend of Newfoundlanders and
thinks kindly of us, but I want to correct
the impression he may have given that Newfoundland is "way off there in the east" and
cannot participate in this great tourist movement in Canada.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Prati: I entirely agree with what
that honourable gentleman from Churchill
said about tourist travel helping to bring
about a better understanding among the
peoples of the world. I cannot conceive of
a better way in which the people of one
country can learn about those of another
country than by tourist travel. People
throughout Canada have still a lot to learn
about Newfoundland. That is natural, for
there are a lot of misconceptions to clear up.
For instance, Newfoundland has had the
entirely undeserved reputation of being
shrouded in fog most of the time. To many
people the words "Newfoundland" and "fog"
are synonymous. The idea that Newfoundland
is enveloped in fog bas sprung from the fact
that the Grand Banks of Newfoundland,
which are some three or four hundred miles
to the south-east of the island, are a foggy
area, through which thousands of people pass
every year on ocean liners. I have heard it
said, and I think there is something in it,
that there is more fog in the minds of the
people in other parts of Canada about Newfoundland than there is around the shores of
our island. That is not an unkind remark. It
is only natural that mistaken notions about
Newfoundland should still persist in the rest
of Canada, for we have only been in the
family of provinces a short while.
I should like to take this opportunity to
make a few remarks in regard to the tourist
attractions of Newfoundland. Honourable
senators have extolled the beauties of Quebec,
the Maritimes and other parts of Canada,
Hon. Calveri C. Prait: Honourable senators, but not many people know of the beauties
I did not intend taking part in this debate, of Newfoundland. We have unexcelled
but I feel compelled to say a word after scenery, with delightful bays and coves and
listening to the eloquent address made by arms of the sea, of entrancing beauty. Our
the honourable gentleman from Churchill rivers and lakes are a sportsman's paradise.
(Hon. Mr. Crerar). He made a most excellent I do not want to elaborate on the particular
case on behalf of the tourist trade in Canada, topic of fishing, for I cannot trust myself as
but when he traced the attractions of the to time, but I will take a moment to say

MARCH 26, 1953
that we do have delightful sport fishing. Our
sea fishing, which is available in the coves
around the shores, can be a great attraction
to tourists. Just come to Newfoundland and
try it out.
Our tourist facilities are not developed to
the same degree as in many of the provinces,
but these are increasing. We have an active
tourist organization which is rapidly expanding tourist facilities throughout Newfoundland. Our road-building program has progressed substantially, and the proposed ferry
service will make the island more accessible
as a tourist vacation-land. We have not yet
got a national park. However, we have
sites that would make as beautiful parks
as you could find anywhere, and I hope that
it will not be too long before we have a
national park of our own.
Our splendid airports are located near
centres of great attraction to tourists. Incidentally, we are getting some tourist trade
from overseas, and it will increase, because of
our airports being only a few hours from
Europe. Not long ago I was fishing on a
river, and as two people passed in a canoe I
asked my guide who they were. He replied
they were a man and his son from Belgium
who had arrived the day before for a week's
fishing on the river. I have fished with visitors who came to Newfoundland from as far
away as Texas to fish.
There are many tourist attractions on the
island, and we are endeavouring to set up
first-class facilities. The honourable senator
from Churchill mentioned scenery, facilities,
and service as essentials in the development
of the tourist trade. We have the scenery
in Newfoundland, and are developing the

facilities and service. He included courtesy
also in his list. I can assure him that
nowhere in the Dominion of Canada will
he find courtesy more abounding than in
Newfoundland.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I be permitted a
word? Perhaps I owe an apology to our colleagues from Newfoundland, but when I mentioned the Maritime provinces I thought I
included Newfoundland. It has not been my
good fortune to visit the island yet, but that
is an omission which I hope to remedy before
long. I am glad, too, of the contribution made
by our colleague from De Salaberry (Hon.
Mr. Gouin). I could have dwelt at much
greater length on the qualities of Quebec,
and of the other provinces too, but I am one
of those who, under the benign influence of
my colleague from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler),
dislikes making long speeches.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: Honourable senators,
before this subject is closed I would like to
call attention to a matter of great interest to
the Tourist Traffic Committee. In the April
issue of Reader's Digest, an American magazine with a circulation in the millions, there
is a full-page picture in colours of the Columbia ice field, which is between Jasper and
Lake Louise and is a great tourist attraction
in summer. That picture is cheap advertising
for Canada, but it is highly effective.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, I
move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday,
March 31, at 3 p.m.

Prayers and routine proceedings.
THE ROYAL ASSENT
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that he had received a communication from
the Assistant Secretary to the Governor
General, acquainting him that the Right
Honourable Thibaudeau Rinfret, Chief Justice
of Canada, acting as Deputy of His Excellency
the Governor General, would proceed to the
Senate Chamber this day at 5.45 p.m., for the
purpose of giving the Royal Assent to certain
bills.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Wishar McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, may I make a brief reference to
what should be, I suggest, our program in the
immediate future and, perhaps, a little later.
In a few minutes His Honour the Speaker will
announce some legislation which bas come
from the other place. As to two items of
this, namely the Interim Supply Bill and the
bill granting supplementary supply for the
year ending today, there is some urgency. As
regards two other measures-the bill respecting the liability of the Crown for torts and
civil salvage, and the Emergency Powers Bill
-I suggest that they be pla.ced at the foot of
the Order Paper and, if copies have been
distributed meanwhile, be considered this
day. I am not suggesting that these bills be
explained today, for there is no urgency about
them.
Honourable senators, I intend to move later
in the week, when we have cleared our Order
Paper, that we stand adjourned until Tuesday, April 14; therefore, some of the bills
coming to us today will be put down on the
Order Paper for second reading on that date.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the honourable
leader when it is intended that the house will
adjourn?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Some day this week,
but I should not like to commit myself as to
what particular day. I can assure my honourable friend from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) that just as soon as we have disposed
of the business on our Order Paper I shall
move the adjournment.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Very well.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Did I understand the
honourable leader to say that we shall proceed
with the Emergency Powers Bill today?

Hon. Mr. Robertson: There is no urgency
about it, but I thought that if copies of the
Crown Liýabili(.y B111 and the Energenry
Powers Bill were distributed we might proceed with some discussion on them.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I have not yet seen a copy
of the Emergency Powers Bill.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: If honourable senators
would prefer, these bills could be initiated
tomorrow. I am only suggesting that we
migbt proceed with some discussion in order
to have some work.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The only urgency at the
present time is in connection with the supply
bills?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: That is right. As
honourable senators know, the present
Emergency Powers Act does not expire until
May 31. There is really no urgency about
the bill dealing with that.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Could we not let second
reading of that bill stand until tomorrow?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I would point out that copies
of the Emergency Powers Bill have been
distributed and are probably on the files of
honourable members.
I personally should
like to see the Crown Liability legislation
explained today. I do not wish to take part
in any debate at this time, but if an explanation were given today it would help honourable senators in their study of this bill.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I am in the hands of
honourable members. Copies of the Crown
Liability Bill have not yet been distributed
but I hope that will be done within the next
half hour. I have asked the honourable
senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) to explain the bill, but only with the
idea of initiating some discussion. Perhaps
honourable senators would prefer to have
second reading moved tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I should like to see
second reading proceeded with today.
Hon. Mr. Haig: So should I.

THE LATE ARCHBISHOP VACHON
TRIBUTES TO HIS MEMORY

On the Orders of the Day:
[Translation]:
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancourt: Honourable senators, before we proceed with the orders of the
day, I would like to call attention to the
deep affliction which has stricken the whole
country, through the loss of the Archbishop
of Ottawa, the Right Rev. Mgr. Alexandre
Vachon.
Not only was Archbishop Vachon a great
churchman, not only did he devote himself
heart and soul to his flock, but to Canada as
a whole he was a man of science who
helped to develop science in theory and
in practice throughout the country. He shed
great light upon science and its practical
applications. He was recognized as a scholar
by McGill and Queen's universities. He
founded the Department of Science of Laval
University. He was also one of the first
governors of the newborn organization which
has since become the C.B.C. He devoted
himself to these tasks with a fervour and an
affability which were almost proverbial.
He died at his task while serving God and
the Church. If death came to him so far
away from us, so far from his own archdiocese which he loved so dearly, it is because
the higher authorities of the Church had
recognized his exceptional ability, his great
piety and his selfless devotion to duty and
had entrusted him with the responsibility
of organizing, or rather, of presiding over the
organization of international eucharistic
congresses.
As a French Canadian, as a Canadian
without any hyphen, I wish to extend to the
authorities of the archdiocese of Ottawa my
deepest condolences. His memory will ever
remain with us, for all those who met him
admired him and immediately loved him.
May God, in his great mercy, give him the
reward of the faithful servant and everlasting
peace.
[Texti:
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable
senators, on behalf of the people of Ottawa
and its neighbourhood I should like to express
appreciation of what our friend the honourable senator from Kennebec (Hon. Mr.

have

known the late Archbishop since 1932. To
all classes in this community he was an
outstanding figure. As my honourable friend
who has just sat down knows, his background was Irish, as well as French. He was
an outstanding scholar, especially in the fields
of science and mathematics. He was one of
the first Governors of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation; and he contributed,
more than most people know, to the welfare
of the people of Ottawa and beyond it. In
connection with the work of his church he
was, of course, prominently identified, not
only as the promoter but as the actual organizer, of the great Marian Congress which
was held here a few years ago. In the
minds and hearts of a great many who came
in contact with him from time to time the
deepest regret will be felt at his sudden
passing. Although his great gifts have been
exerted in the best interests of this country
for a generation, he was still comparatively
young, and his future could not but have
been associated with much greater achievements than those he had already accomplished. I can only express, on my own
behalf and that of the people I know and
whom, in a way, I feel I represent, deep
regret at his passing and profound respect
for his memory.

TOURIST TRAFFIC
REPORT OF COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed froin Thursday,
March 26, the adjourned debate on the
motion of Hon. Mr. Buchanan for adoption
of the report of the Standing Committee on
Tourist Traffic recommending that the conmittee be authorized to print its proceedings.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
it is not my intention to occupy your time
in extolling any particular part or province
of Canada. In the first place, the problen
before us is too important to be confined to
the merits of any one section of the country.
I say that no less sincerely because I come
from the most wonderful province in Canada; and having said that, perhaps I have
said enough. There is an old and familiar
saying, "See Naples and live." I would urge
my honourable friends to "see British Columbia and live".
To speak personally; I have visited eight
of the ten provinces of the Dominion, and
I have seen places of beauty wherever I
have gone. Beauty is not confined to any
one district, but it is only natural to consider
the place we call home to be the most beautiful of all. We must remember that different
people see things differently and do not always
seek the same things in their travels. For
instance, many visitors to the Pacific coast
from the Prairie provinces have made the
comment, "We cannot see anything for the
mountains". Many people complain about our
rainy weather in British Columbia, but people
fron California, coming fron a dry and arid
country, seern to revel in it. Indeed, one of

their greatest delights is to visit the evergreen province of British Columbia.
I should like to mention some of Canada's
tourist attractions. First, we have the mountains of British Columbia.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I thought my honourable
friend was not going to discuss the tourist
attractions of British Columbia.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I assure my honourable
friend that if I did it would take all day.
I merely refer to our mountains in passing.
Among Canada's attractions for the sportsman are mountain climbing, salt and fresh
water fishing, skiing, big and smail game
hunting, and swimming. Many tourists like
to visit our cities. We have all seen the
great hordes of visitors who descend upon
Ottawa every year. They come here not
to see Ottawa as a city, for many other
Canadian civic communities have more to
offer, but because Ottawa is the seat of the
federal government. Despite the fact that
Washington, D.C., has the Congressional
buildings and many other fine edifices, and
each state bas its own splendid legislative
building, Americans are high in their praise
of the dignity and solemn beauty of Canada's
parliament buildings here in Ottawa. But
Ottawa itself will never have much to offer
tourists unless it does a lot more than it has
done and is doing. It is the most poorly
lighted city I have ever been in. Its streets
are dark at night, and the pavement on some
of the main streets is in a terrible condition.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It has not been mentioned
in this debate, but Canadians themselves are
a considerable attraction to American tourists.
Americans just love to visit us because we
are different from themselves. True, our
parliamentary systems have a common origin,
and we spring from the same stock, but there
is in Canadians a distinct quality which most
Americans admire. I have always looked
kindly upon aur neighbours in the United
States, and have taken issue with Canadians
who seek dollars from American tourists,
while at the same time regarding the tourists
theinselves with suspicion. It has been stated
in the Massey Comnmission's Report and by
officials of the CBC that we are in danger
of becoming Americaniized if we continue to
listen in to American radio and television
programs as closely as we have in past years.
Sone people forget that Canadianism or the
Canadian way of life is more than two
hundred years old, and that the people of
Canada and the United States are almost
as distinct as are the people of England and
Scotland. If there ever was a land where it
might have been feared that there was danger

SENATE
of one race absorbing another, surely it was
flrpnt Britain.
But you have in the north of
Britain that great -country Scotland, whose
people are as Scottish today as they ever were;
and in the south of Britain you have England,
whose people are just as English as they ever
were. It is simply balderdash to argue that
we are in danger of being contaminated, or
swallowed up by Americanism because of
allowing American rad.io and television programs to enter our homes as freely as they
do now. It simply is not true.
I wonder how many honourable senators
have read The American-Born in Canada.
This statistical study by R. H. Coats, former
head of the Dominion Bureau of Statistics,
and M. C. Maclean, an equally eminent statisIt is not
tician, is well worth reading.
generally known that at the beginning of
the ýcentury, before the great immigration to
Canada, American-born citizens made up 45 -9
per cent of the foreign population of Canada.
According to the latest available figures, those
of the 1931 census, there were at that time
some 819,000 people of American birth or
extraction in this country. Of this total,
475,000 were Canadians born of American
parents and 344,000 were born in the United
States. It is important to note that these
people have been evenly distributed throughout the country, and their assimilation into
the Canadian way of life has been more
rapid than that of any other people who have
-come here. It is interesting to learn that 72
per cent of all Americans settling in Canada
have become naturalized Canadians, whereas
only 45 per cent of other foreign-born immigrants have taken this step.
In support of what I've just said I should
like to read a paragraph from this book:
Great as are the penetrating powers of a conmon press, a common literature, and an overlapping
radio, they probably do not transcend continuous
daily personal contacts-though as yet we rnay not
test such judgments with exactness. The even
distribution, however, of the Arnerican-born over
Canada spells, on the face of it, that they are at one
and the sane time disseminating their influence
widely and themselves becoming Canadianized.

I bring this up this afternoon because, in
various quarters, in high circles and low,
there has been some sniping at our neighbours
to the south. Great numbers of Americans
who come to this country must wonder if our
principal welcoming them here is, not to
show them the great beauties of this country,
but to take their money.
The tourist traffic figures, when one
examines them, are astounding. Last year
12,619,000 vehicles crossed the border to come
into Canada. Of these, 7,857,000 were foreign
vehicles, that is, motor cars and trucks from

the United States, driven by Americans.
Returning Canadians totalled 4,744,000.
But what is also of great nterest is the
amount that was spent by Canadians in the
United States, as against the amount of money
spent by Americans in this country. Here
again some doubt may be thrown on the
accuracy of the sums of money quoted as
having been spent by Americans in Canada,
because there is not the same close check
taken of the moneys spent by Americans in
Canada as there is of the moneys spent by the
Canadians in the United States, and for this
reason: When one intends to travel in the
United States, invariably he must convert
his Canadian funds to American dollars, and
there is an accurate record kept by the banks
and forwarded to Ottawa of all the American
currency which Canadians purchase.
But
there is no such procedure or check when
Americans enter this country. I have always
had my doubts as to the amount of money
that they spend or are supposed to spend
while here. I can quite understand that
officials in charge of tourists bureaux and of
certain government departments want to
make out a very fine showing. It puts me in
mind of the nice figures put out by people
in charge of fish hatcheries. They tell you
about the millions of eggs taken from the fish,
and the millions of fingerlings or small fry
put in the water. This builds up a beautiful
picture, but the results are not so very
encouragng.
It is, however, interesting to note that
Canadians now spend more money in the
United States in two months than was previously spent in the entire twelve months of
any year up to 1939. What is the reason
for this increased spending?
Almost every year I travel across several
of the northern states, in a new car, and I
know something of the cities that I pass
through. Most Canadians who go across the
line do more buying while over there than
Americans do in Canada, because in the first
place, there is a greater variety of most lines
of goods in the United States. And besides,
the goods do not cost so much as in Canada.
I want to repeat what I've said on previous
occasions, that Americans who live here, some
temporarily and some permanently, complain
there is no difference in price between goods
of the same kind in Canadian stores from one
end of the country to the other. The price in
Vancouver is the price you pay in Ottawa
and in Halifax. But it is not so in the cities
and towns of the United States. Because
there is greater competition over there, and
the housewife, and the family man too bas
a better opportunity to shop around, and can

MAIRCH 31, 1953
;almost invaýriably buy cheaper thamn we can
in this country.
It is interesting to note that quite a lot of
people corne to Canada by bus, by boat and
by air; but I want to deal for a moment or
two with the part that railways play in
handling traffic, particularly, the Canadian
tourist traffic.
When we are speaking of
tourists we should take the broad view and
remember that tourists include also our own
people who travel in Canada, as well as
visitors from the United States. 0f course,
we look mostly if not entirely to the United
States for tourists, and perhaps not so many
of them travel on our trains as by motor car.
1 think it was the senator from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner) who mentioned particuIarly the cost of meals on our railways. I
want to deal with that for a minute and
refer to something that I believe is wrong
with our railways.
I have before me a
statement which shows the loss of passenger
traffic on our two railways. The figures are
most enlightening. There is no doubt that
it is the cost of transporting passengers and
of caterin-g to them that is putting the railways in the position they are in today. Now,
why are they raising their freight rates?
It is true that wages is one item which causes
freight rates to go up, but the drop in number
of passengers, and the loss the railways are
suffering in hauling passengers, is in my
opinion one of the chief reasons why the
people who ship goods by railway are being
called upon to bear an extra burden. That
ks, they pay not only for the hauling of the
freight, but they help to make up part if not
ail of the loss that the railways suifer on their
passenger traffjc.
In coming back to the session just a few
days ago I hacl some experience with the
railway meal service. An ordinary breakfast,
which is simple but good and ample enough
for anyone when travelling, consists of oatmeal, cream, brown bread, toast and marmalade, and tea or coifee. The charge for
that breakfast on the train was, $1.85, which,
with a tip, meant $2 or more. I was astonished
to see only six passengers in the dining car,
and I asked the head steward "Where are the
crowds?" "Oh," he said "they are not coming
in now; the price of the meals has driven
them off". And, as pointed out a littie while
ago by the senator from Blaine Lake (Hon.
Mr. Horner), you~ cannot possibly get a
midday lunch or dinner on the dining car for
less than $2.50 to $3.50. So it is no wonder
that people are not patronizing the dining car.
A few days ago there was a very interesting hearing before the Board of Transport
Commissioners, sitting in Vancouver. The

Canadian Pacific Railway was on the stand
on the question 0f an increase in passenger
fares. Mr. Warren, the General Traffic Manager of that company, pointed out that the
railway collected $1,285 from a coach carrying fifty passengers from Calgary to Vancouver; and that a sleeping car carrying
twenty passengers over the samne Unme showed
a total revenue 0f only $798. He further
pointed out that the railway lost 65 cents on
every meal it served.
The traffic manager had something vecry
pertinent to say about those who use drawing
roins and such accommodation. It might
interest honourable senators to hear what
Mr. Warren did say in that regard:
The railways' love f or the littie man in the day
coach came out when expert witnesses for the
companies presented evidence to show the haifcent differential is justified in B.Ç. because it costs
more to operate over the mountains.

Incidentally, that is disputable and something with which I do not agree.
His remarks continue:
As far as the raflways are concerned, the big
shot-

And I may say that while I do not belong
among the big shots, I usually take a bedroom or roomette when I travel home.
-the big shot who pays for the lush drawing room
in the observation car woulýd be better off extinct.

That is a pretty strong statement, but I
think it supports what I saîd a few minutes
ago, that the loss of passenger revenue is the
cause of the ever-încrea-sing burden being
placed on those who ship freight on the
railways.
A rather amusing incident took place at
the recent inquiry in Vancouver. It was
shown that while the government of British
Columbia was seeking to have the B.C. passenger rate cut from four and a haif cents
to four cents per mile on the C.P.R., the
rate on its own provincially-operated railway,
the Pacific Great Eastern was 4-6 cents, and
s0 higher than that charged by the C.P.R.
The spokesman for the government was redfaced when hie was asked to justify that
situation.
The railways are facing a most serious
problem, and while I do not intend to discuss
it exhaustively, there are a few points I
should like to bring out. In my opinion the
trains or coaches of today are too heavy and
f ar too slow. A traveller can leave Vancouver, go south a hundred and twenty miles,
board the Great Northern Raflway and arrive
in Toronto almost a day earlier than if he
had travelled by either of the Canadian lines.
It is notable that the fare on the Canadian
and American routes is about the samne, except
for the 15 per cent tax which is added to the
American purchaser. Many Vancouver people

SENATE
who wish to go to Toronto and do not choose
to travel by air can save almost a day by
travelling via the Great Nortnern Raiiway.
That line is taking passengers away from the
Canadian lines, and what are they doing to
meet the competition? Nothing.
When Donald Gordon was appointed head
of the Canadian National Railways System
I looked for great things, but there are some
traditional hurdles and knotty problems which
I doubt if any man can overcome. One of
the hurdles is the unions' control of employees
I am not against unions. Another
-and
hurdle is the practice of using the Canadian
Pacific Railway as a yardstick.
In my early days in Ottawa I have left
here on a train which arrived from Montreal six hours late and yet got into New
Westminster right on time. Where did that
train make up the six hours? I have said
without fear of successful contradiction that
but for the Canadian Pacific Railway, the
Canadian National Railway could cut its
schedule across Canada by at least ten or
twelve hours. We may as well be frank: a
dozen men like Donald Gordon could not
surmount the yardstick hurdle. He may
know a great deal about finance, but he is
up against at least two practical problems that
seem so far to be incapable of solution. Are
we going to stand by and see passenger
figures in Canada go down and down, while
our railways continue to suffer losses?
The railways are also meeting serious competition from the airlines. The number of
passengers now being carried by air exceeds
by fourteen times those carried in 1935.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: And that is a more
expensive means of travel.
Hon. Mr. Reid: No, I do not think it is more
expensive. When one pays the first-class fare
and has his meals on the diner, rail travel is
not much cheaper than air. However, the
business man who is interested in saving time
has a big inducement to travel by plane. And
there is this further competition to which
I have referred, by which passengers from
Vancouver have their way paid to Seattle and
come east via the Great Northern Railway,
and save nearly one whole day. People
living in these days of fast travel are not now
content to spend three days and four nights
on the journey from Vancouver to Toronto.
We know that the railways are facing everincreasing problems. It sometimes seems to
me that with the advance being made by the
oil pipe lines, about all that the railways
will have left to carry soon is lumber, coal,
and other low-cost freight.
The honourable senator from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner), when speaking on the

tourist traffic of Canada, had something worth
while to say about the attitude of our people
towardb

visiturs

withinour

gates.

The hnn-

ourable senator from Kootenay East (Hon.
Mr. King) posed, I think, a real problem.
From his speech I gathered that he was worried about the millions of dollars Canada is
spending on her national parks and on her
travel bureau. When one considers the 1952
deficit, one wonders whether we are getting
value for our money. We cannot expect many
tourists from any country but the United
States; therefore, we should encourage more
travel by Canadians between the various
provinces of Canada.
I venture to say that the people of British
Columbia travel more than the people of any
other province in Canada. A large percentage
of the people now living in British Columbia
came originally from the east, and therefore
know more about Canada generally than most
other people do. A further interesting fact
is that British Columbia bas more motor cars
per capita than any other province.
I wonder how many honourable senators
have visited the province of British Columbia.
I think it is the duty of every one who enters
publie life to see how the people outside his
own province live, move and have their being;
although, I am sure other honourable senators, like myself, having seen things abroad,
are always glad to come home again.
I should like to mention one more thing
which I believe should be done. The honourable senator from Kootenay East (Hon. Mr.
King), in referring to the need of good highways, suggested that the federal government
should do more than it is doing, and should
bear the entire cost. I heartily agree with
him. In my opinion the federal government
is simply fiddling around with this problem.
The Minister of Resources and Development,
when speaking of the work of the Travel
Bureau, and looking to its further expansion,
said: "Once we get started with the TransCanada highway things will be better." How
long are we to wait until we have a modern
highway across Canada? The modern car is
built with a very low wheel-base, and as
long as the driver is on a smooth pavement
he has no trouble; but once he strikes a rough
deep-rutted road, Heaven help him; he is
liable to lose the under-part of his car. I
have met visitors from the United States who
told me that they will never come back here.
Americans are used to wonderful modern
highways, and are not willing to travel over
some of our rough roads. There is an urgent
need of improvement.
In this connection I would suggest that the
Dominion government could well afford, in
the national interests, to build a military

MARCH 31, 1953
highway extending from one end of the
country to the other. Under present conditions all we can depend upon in time of
trouble is our railway system, and as 2,200
motor vehicles are needed to service one
army division, the railroads, even if they
were not put out of action by enemy action,
would be unable by themselves to adequately
take care of military transportation in case
of a serious attack. For one thing, the movement of army trucks would be a matter of
grave difficulty. I suggest that the federal
government give some serious thought to this
matter. In building such a highway it would
not be necessary to consult the provinces;
the dominion government could buy the land
and construct the highway. I belleve also
that such a project could be made to pay
its way, quite apart from its value for military purposes. In many parts of the United
States, toll roads are being constructed on
which travel at a speed of ninety miles an
hour or more is permitted. I have in mind
one such thoroughfare near Chicago, two
hundred and fifty miles long; so many people
are using it that another road nearby is
under construction.
This highway gives
people a feeling of safety when travelling
at high speeds.
After all, what is the use of motor-car
manufacturers increasing the horsepower of
automobile engines if travellers are restricted
to speeds of anywhere between twenty-five
and forty miles an hour? I am not advocating
increased speed, but the fact is that people
like to travel fast, and across the line they
are patronizing these private toll roads to
such an extent that more and more are being
built. So that a trans-Canada road of this
kind, though-properly-under rigid control,
could be made to pay. Sound construction
is essential, because there is no doubt that
trucks of a weight of fifty and sixty tons
would want to travel over these roads and
in increasing numbers. So, if we intend to
attack this road problem seriously, and to
attract tourists and benefit from the money
they bring in, more highways will have to
be built, north and south as well as east and
west.
Americans, of course, are great travellers.
Millions of them visit their own national
parks. One of the main things that brings
them here is, as already said, their great
liking for the Canadian people. I want to
impress that point. None of us who have lived
in the United States, even though briefly and
as visitors, can fail to realize that Americans
think highly of our people. What attracts so
many tourists to Europe is the tie of tradition
and family associations. Perhaps the parents
or grandparents of the visiting Canadian or

American lived in some Scottish or English
or French hamlet; the strength of family
tradition takes them back to their ancestral
homes. In like manner, many Americans will
make their way to Canada because their
parents were born in this country. Let us
encourage the influences which unite rather
than those which may divide. I want to place
myself on record as absolutely opposed to
any policy which seeks to bar or block out
the reception of radio or television from the
United States on the theory that such things
tend to Americanize us.
I have spoken rather longer than I intended
to, and had there been more business before
the Senate I might not have spoken at all;
but I thought I would take this opportunity
of making a small contribution to the debate
by placing a few thoughts before you. I do
so with all praise to the committee who are
handling the subject and with the request
that, if the committee sits again next year, as
I hope it will, there will be an adequate
breakdown of the figures presented to it.
For instance, it would be well to know, in
connection with the number of tourists, how
many are visitors and how many are merely
commuters; and as regards attendance at our
parks, whether the same visitor is registered
at three or four parks and how many
Americans are comprised in the total number
of persons registered. The committee would
be well advised, I think, to go a little more
deeply into the matters I have mentioned.
The debate itself has been very useful and
some interesting figures and other facts have
been brought out.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
it is not my intention to participate in the
debate, but I would be remiss were I not to
say a word in appreciation of the excellent
work which has been done by various committees that have considered this subject; not
only the one whose very capable chairman
is my honourable friend from Lethbridge
(Hon. Mr. Buchanan), but-to delve a little
into the past-the committee whose activities were initiated by the honourable
senator from Halifax (Hon. Mr. Dennis).
These two gentlemen, prominent business
men and publishers, have brought to the
activities of the committee during the time
they presided over it the great experience,
vision and knowledge which have characterized their operation of two outstanding Canadian newspapers; and I am sure the Senate
will agree with me when I say how much we
appreciate the services which, in their work
on this committee, they have rendered the
people of Canada.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: Honourable senators,
I move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.
APPROPRIATION BILL No. 2
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 292, an Act for granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money
for the public service of the financial year
ending the 31st March, 1953.
He said: Honourable senators will appreciate that this is one of the bills as to which
there is some urgency. It covers the provision
of additional sums for the financial year
which ends today. There is another bill,
which I shall move subsequently, to grant a
interim supply a portion of the estimates for
the coming year, 1953-54.
This particular bill in regard to the extra
amount of money required for the public
service of the expiring financial year, is to
provide the sum of $77,680,383. There are
a number of smaller items but the major one
of $32,346,000 arises as a result of the embargo
placed on the shipment of our cattle to the
United States after the outbreak of the footand-mouth disease in Canada. The next
largest item is in the amount of $25,000,000which has almost become an annual appropriation-to provide for a further special government contribution to reduce the unamortized
portion of the Civil Service Superannuation
Account liability. It will be remembered
that some time ago an actuarial inquiry disclosed that a large deficit existed in this
account because insufficient moneys had been
appropriated to meet this liability. I believe
that since 1947 the government has been
endeavouring to wipe out the accumulated
deficit by means of bulk contributions.
The sum of $3,700,000 is provided as a
further amount required for freight assistance on western feed grains. There is also
a grant of $1 million to the Canadian National
European Flood Relief Fund. This appropriation is of course made in connection with
the flood disaster that struck England and the
Lowlands a short time ago.
The amount of $32,346,000, to which I
referred a moment ago, is to cover the net
operating loss of the Agricultural Prices
Support Board during the fiscal year 1952-53,
including authority to credit to the account
the net revenue received into the Agricultural Products Board account from the sale
of New Zealand meat received in exchange
for beef shipped to the United Kingdom. I
shall not go into the details of this item
except to say that the board suffered a net

loss of $6,075,000 on the production of canned
pork, and $23,006,405 on the beef account. It
wul

be remembered

ihcla

une of

our major

programs with respect to cattle was the
acceptance of carcass beef for shipment to
the United Kingdom in return for which New
Zealand beef was sold in the United States
to offset the cost of Canadian beef.
Vote 553 provides $9,660 in connection
with the health of animals. Vote 557 provides $200,000 as a further amount required
to provide for quality premiums on high
grade hog carcasses and administration costs.
Vote 558 provides $300,000 as a further
amount required for the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act and water storage. The amount
of $250,000 is provided as a further payment
required for major irrigation and reclamation projects in the Prairie provinces.
Vote 562 provides $276,000 as a further
,payment to National Gallery Purchase
Account for the purpose of acquiring works
of art, in conformity with section 8 of the
National Gallery Act.
Vote 565 provides $100,000 as a contribution to the United Nations Refugee Emergency Fund, and vote 568 provides $153,856
as a grant to municipalities in lieu of taxes
on federal property.
Honourable senators, there are some
smaller items, such as the one to cover additional legislation costs which arise annually
by way of remuneration of members of the
Senate and House of Commons for days lost
through absence caused by illness, and so on,
but I have dealt with the main items of the
bill.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
find myself in a rather peculiar position this
afternoon, for I am one of those who thought
it would be unwise this session for the Standing Committee on Finance to examine into
the estimates. I must now confess that I
greatly miss the information gathered by
this committee in its annual study of the
estimates. I have read many fine comments
in the press on the work done by this committee in former years and regretting the fact
that the committee did not meet this session.
I was fearful that with a general election
coming on within the next six months it might
be argued that our committee was gathering
information which would reflect the policies
of one party or another, and I did not want
to see members of our house involved in any
political controversy. It must be difficult
for newspaper editors to get information
upon which they can rely, even from reading the estimates, unless the details are corroborated by evidence of expert witnesses
before our Finance Committee.

MARCH 31, 1953
Honourable senators, I should like to make
a few complimentary remarks about the
honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar), who comes from my province of
Manitoba. He has been a success in both
private and public life. As one who has
been active in the fields of law, education
and business in our province, I should be in
a position to judge the contribution our
esteemed friend bas made to the public welfare of Canada. I firmly believe that his
greatest contribution of all has been made
through his chairmanship of the Senate's
Committee on Finance these last four years,
and his annual report from that committee
to the Senate.

Hon. Mr. Euler: Excuse me, I think my
friend is wrong. I was in the House of
Commons at the time. The matter came up
in committee, and there was some suggestion
that the agreement be cancelled, but it was
not cancelled.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Sir Robert Borden was
then the Prime Minister of Canada, and a
bill was passed in the other place to repeal
the Crowsnest Pass Agreement. That was
in 1919. As I have said, Sir Robert Borden's
government passed in the other place a bill
to repeal the agreement. When it came to

of Sir James Lougheed, and with a Conservative majority refused to pass it. There

would pay such a large part of it in taxes

SENATE
that it is not worth the effort." Now, you
may sav that the man who makes the money
should pay the taxes. But what about the
man who invests his money in a corporation?
We are told that corporations are "big people",
but in fact corporations are the littlest people
of all.

Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: They are made up of the
fellows who cannot afford to have a business
of their own. They invest, they buy stock,
and so on, and they are taxed on the money
put into the corporation; and afterwards they
are taxed again on what they receive from
the corporation. For instance, the Hudson
Bay Mining and Smelting Company, of my
own province, is a highly successful development. I cannot give you the exact figures,
but I think that at the end of the last fiscal
year but one they earned a net profit of
about $8 million.
Hon. Mr. Davis: $13 million.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Was it $13 million? I had
in mind the year before. If you look up the
records you wili find that the company paid
half that sum to the dominion government in
taxes. The other half went to the shareholders who made it possible to make the
profit, and on what they got they paid taxes
over again-probably 50 per cent, perhaps 25
per cent, or 19 per cent as the case might be.
While these things are practised in our
economy there can be no accumulation of
wealth from investments; and that is why
wealth is coming in from other parts of the
world to develop our resources.
Now I want to deal more particularly with
the budget. In one sense the budget is composed of two parts-the civilian part and
the war part. Now, I do not need any investigation, or any Currie report, or any Auditor
General's report to prove that government
expenditure today is more widely spread than
ever before. There is no use in denying it.
Money is being spent without proper examination of whether the expenditure is justified;
and the day will come, if present trends are
not controlled, when we shall join the countries which already are -clamouring for
assistance. What will happen to trade with
Great Britain and France? So long as the
American people will put up cash so that
countries in need can buy goods from us, well
and good. But when they have not the cash
to purchase our goods, what then? I think
our beef contract with Great Britain was for
$30 million. Great Britain sold us New
Zealand beef, and we sold it to the United
States for about $8 million. Is that good
business? Would it not have been better to
slaughter the cattle for home consumption,

and pay for them-even to have given the
beef to the people of Canada? You may say
Wpl1, hnw
that would have cut the prie'.
are we going to lower the cost of living in
this country so long as the government uses
the taxpayers' money in a way which has
the effect of keeping prices up? That is what
is being done. Whether or not it is good
politics for me to talk in this way, that is the
fact. Perhaps my wife goes into a store
to buy a roast of beef and pays about 75
cents a pound for it; whereas if we had not
put $22 million into that beef contract she
might have had to pay only 50 cents a pound.
Of ýcourse, so long as wages continue to rise,
costs of materials will rise in consequence,
and under our system of economy the primary
producer will be the first to suffer. We must
recognize the fact that heavy taxation is the
greatest problem facing this country.
I would next turn to the matter of education and its ever-growing cost. Like the
honourable member from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) and, perhaps, some others in this
house, I began my career as a school teacher.
For four years I taught for the magnificent
sum of $35 a month. True, I paid only $10
a month for my board and room, but my
annual income was only $420. Today the
lowest teaching salary in the province of
Manitoba is $1,600 a year, and the minimum
is soon to be $2,000. But our young men and
women can go into other occupations where
there is less responsibility and better pay.
For instance, a stenographer can leave business college and enter the employment of
one of the railway companies at a starting
salary of $165 a month, with the expectation
of an increase to $185 within two or three
months. Why should a young girl burden
herself with the duties of a school teachera most difficult and important task-for a
salary lower than she would get were she
a stenographer in a railway office?
The cost of the construction of schools is
a major factor today. I can recall when the
city of Winnipeg built schools for about $5,000
per room; today, similar schools cost $10,000
and $12,000 per room. It must always be
remembered that this cost falls on the owners
of real estate.
The federal government last year appropriated $7 million to be divided, on a basis
of population, among Canadian universities.

colleges affiliated with the university, of
whose board I have the honour to be chairman, received $52,000 or $54,000. Without it
we would have been in difficulty. I notice

MARCH 31, 1953
that a university in Nova Scotia is complaining that it does not get enough help under
this system.
Under the British North America Act
education is a matter within provincial jurisdiction. But the dominion government, either
by rental agreement with the provinces or
otherwise, has taken over the great sources
of revenue other than taxes on real property
and licensing fees, with the result that municipalities have not enough revenue to meet
the costs of education. It will be a bad
day for Canada when our educational system
is hampered because of our inability to raise
enough money to maintain it.
I know that school teachers and trustees
across Canada are demanding that the federal
government shall hand out more money for
education; on the other hand, some provincial
authorities feel that if the government were
to contribute for that purpose it would interfere with the jurisdiction of the province
in the educational field. I recognize those
fears, and I do not suggest that there should
be any interference with provincial rights
in that respect. But I do suggest that the
federal and provincial governments should
step out of certain taxation fields to enable
municipalities to collect enough money to
meet their local educational needs. The next
government will have to face the problem of
rising costs of education.
I make this plea, honourable senators, as
a former school teacher, realizing full well
the important role the teacher plays. As a
former pupil, I can never forget my first
teacher, at Alexander School. My greatest
inspiration in life came from my teachers in
high school-I can still name some of them:
Wilson, Mclntyre and O'Shea-and the things
that I learned from my university professors
have stayed with me through life. With the
exception of the teachings of my mother and
father, I can recall those of my teachers and
professors better than any others. Our system
of education is indeed the backbone of this
country; and I plead with the people to
send to parliament men and women who will
appreciate the problem and make some provision for municipal revenue to meet the
high cost of education.
I am not talking from a political point of
view; I am only calling the attention of honourable senators to the fact that because of
our position we have a great responsibility
to the people of this country. That statement has been made before, and it will be
made again by a new generation. I repeat:
our good fortune in life as manifested by our
position, our education and our friends places
upon us the heavy responsibility of devoting

our time to the solving of the country's
problems.
In closing, I cannot give the house a better
illustration of the type of contribution that
honourable senators can make than by calling attention once more to the work of the
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
as chairman of our Finance Committee, and
the enlightening reports which from time to
time he placed before us. A great part of our
population was thereby convinced that the
Senate has the capacity and the ability to
make a proper investigation of government
expenditures and to bring out, not theories,
but fundamental facts. The continuation of
that kind of work on the part of honourable
senators will be a real contribution to the
welfare of Canada.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May -I ask the honourable
leader of the government
(Hon. Mr.
Robertson) if I correctly understood him as
having said that about $6 million of the $32
million vote No. 560, for the Agricultural
Prices Support Board, is needed because of
the policy of price support on pork?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Beef.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I should like the honourable leader to tell us whether the government has a supply on hand and whether it
expects to recover anything in respect of
this item.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
perhaps I could best answer the question by
repeating the information that I have before
me, although it does not indicate what future
costs may be.
On April 1, 1952, the Agricultural Prices
Support Board held 5,492,520 pounds of
canned pork produced to their specifications,
and had a further 92,768,454 pounds produced
to their specifications up to March 31, 1953that is, today.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: They have that on hand?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: It is estimated that
by March 31 the board will have re-sold
25,000,000 pounds of canned pork, principally
in the domestic market, at a net loss to the
Board of $6,075,000. Various pork-cut programs involving 101,437,581
pounds of
products have been carried out, and it is
estimated that about 10,000,000 pounds of
these cuts will remain on hand as at March
31, 1953. The total loss on the cuts re-sold to
March 31 is estimated at $2,733,828.08, which
is mainly represented by the payment of
certain storage, transportation and other
handling charges which had to be added to
the cost in calculating the net loss.

SENATE
To answer my honourable friend's specific
que-tin, i may s;y this cles not represent

the total loss for which we shall be responsible, but it is the estimated loss on what
has been disposed of to the present time. I
have nothing to indicate what the possible
total loss may be.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Honourable senators, I
would not be understood as making a speech
now, but I rise to give what may be the
explanation of the difference of opinion
which rose between the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) and myself with regard
to the Crowsnest Pass agreement. I think
we are referring to two different occasions.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Probably.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What I had in mind was
the time, in 1922, when the King government was in office and a committee, of
which the Honourable Mr. McLean was chairman, passed a resolution to report a bill
whereby the suspension of the Crowsnest
Pass agreement, which was then in force,
should be made permanent: in other words,
the people of the west were to lose the benefit of that agreement. Some of us objected,
as we thought a breach of faith was involved,
and the committee reversed its decision, and
as a result the agreement remained, and still
remains, in force. Perhaps the decision was
wrong: I do not know.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Now that we are in a
reminiscent mood, perhaps the house will
bear with me for a few minutesHon. Mr. Euler: Not too long.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: -upon this point. I do
not know whether I am in order, but with
the indulgence of the house I may be permitted to make a few remarks.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: This is a budget debate.
Hon. Mr. Euler: But whatever you say you
will have to say now. You cannot speak again.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I do not want to speak
again. In 1919 the House of Commons passed
legislation to abrogate the Crowsnest Pass
agreement. That agreement originated in
1898, when the Canadian Pacific Railway, in
recognition of certain assistance which it
received from the federal government to
build into the Crowsnest Pass, agreed on a
statutory limitation for all time of a variety
of rates, one of which covered the movement
of grain to the head of the lakes. An interesting fact which I think I may reveal to the
house is that on one occasion Sir Clifford
Sifton told me that when this legislation
came before parliament in 1898-he was then
Minister of the Interior-he insisted that

there be embodied in the statute the provisions that the agreement covered on freight
rates. In 1919, because of very heavy
increases in railway operating costs that came
into effect after the war which ended the
year before, legislation was passed to abrogate the rates. The bill came to the Senate,
and it was then that the Senate performed
for the people of Western Canada the
inestimable service referred to by the leader
of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) this afternoon. The late Senator Watson, from Manitoba, and the late Senator Lougheed, fron
Alberta, insisted, when the matter was under
consideration in the Senate, that the abrogation should not be permanent but that the
suspension should be for three years only.
This proposal was accepted by the government of the day and the bill so changed
became law. In 1922 the question was on
the doorstep of a Liberal administration
under the late Mr. Mackenzie King. At that
time legislation was introduced further to
extend-indeed to make permanent-ithis suspension. The bill was referred to a committee,
where, as the honourable senator from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) has said, the issue
was fought out. A majority, after prolonged
hearings, decidedHon. Mr. Euler: By one vote.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: -that the bill should be
reported favourably, which of course meant
that the Crowsnest Pass rates would go. It
will be recalled that at that time there was
in the Commons a group known as the Progressives, and your humble servant was at
the head of them. The evening of the day on
which this resolution to report the bill passed
the comrnmittee, I asked the leading newspaper
men in the Press Gallery to come to my office.
I recall it was about 10 o'clock at night. I
said, "Gentlemen, I have some news for you.
You can send out word tonight to your papers
that this legislation will not pass the Conmons excepting under closure; we will
obstruct it in every way we can". That news
was published next day across Canada in the
headlines of the papers. Another upset
occurred when my honourable friend fron
Waterloo-whose action I hold in grateful
remembrance-and several other members of
the Liberal party whose names I could mention, intimated to Prime Minister King that
if the bill was reported to the Commons without the amendment we sought they would
support the Progressives in their stand. The
upshot was that the committee was hastily
reassembled and new evidence was submitted
by an official of the Canadian National Railways. On the strength of this new evidence
the bill was amended and the Crowsnest Pass

MARCH 31, 1953

rates on grain were retained and have
remained the same until this day.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the third reading of the bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
APPROPRIATION BILL No. 1
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 291, an Act for granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money for
the public service of the financial year ending
the 31st March, 1954.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to grant as interim supply a
portion of the estimates currently before
parliament. In order that the public business may be carried on it is customary for
parliament to appropriate a certain percentage
of the total estimates before the main supply
bill is brought down.
This bill provides for one-sixth of the
items to be voted in the main estimates for
the fiscal year beginning April 1, 1953, and
ending March 31, 1954. In addition, it
includes proportional expenditures on certain
items of which the major portion will be
expended early in the year.
The bill comprises three schedules. Specifically, Schedule A votes one-quarter of the
International Trade Fair estimate, as the
greater portion of the money allocated for
this purpose is spent early in the year. I
believe the fair is to be held in Toronto in
June.
Schedule B votes one-sixth of four special
items. One of these items covers sessional
expenses of both houses of parliament, since
a considerable part of these expenses is
incurred early in the year. Another item
arises out of the Unemployment Insurance
Commission's need for financing the cost of
certain movements which, under agreement
with labour-seeking companies, are later
recovered. The seasonal character of such
labour transfers accounts for greater expenditures at an early date.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the honourable
leader if copies of this bill have been distributed?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes.
I have dealt with Schedules A and B.
Under Schedule C the bill provides for onetwelfth of six other items. Two of these

are under the Department of Agriculture.
One is designed to meet the heavy expenses
connected with spring cropping in the
experimental farm service; the other is for
freight assistance on western feed grain for
which the demand is heaviest during the
early months. There is an item under the
Department of Citizenship and Immigration
to meet the needs of the field and inspectional
service of the Immigration Branch abroad,
and to cover the delay between the time when
supply is authorized in Canada and when
formal authority for expenditure reaches distant overseas offices. For these reasons it is
necessary to release funds in Canada several
weeks in advance of their actual use abroad.
The three remaining items relate to the
Department of Trade and Commerce. Two are
for electricity and gas inspection services,
and weights and measures inspection services,
which are carried out during spring and
early summer months. The additional item
is in connection with a winding-up of the
1951 decennial census for which funds will
be needed early in the year.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Can the honourable leader
advise whether bills are still outstanding in
connection with the 1951 decennial census?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The total estimate is
$879,414, to cover the balance of payments
necessary in connection with the census. Evidently there are expenses involved in the
early winding-up of the census which require
additional funds, but this will not be a continuing expense during the whole year, as it
will be concentrated in the early part of
the year.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the third reading of the bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
POST OFFICE BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 107, an Act to amend the
Post Office Act.
The bill was read the first time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: With leave, next sitting.

SENATE
CROWN LIABILITY BILL
Hon. J. W. de B. Farris moved the second
reading of Bill 105, an Act respecting the
liability of the Crown for torts and civil
salvage.
He said: Honourable senators, I do not
think this bill is contentious in so far as this
house is concerned. But it involves a most
important principle which probably the
lawyers in the Senate will appreciate more
than the members who are laymen, because
lawyers have a better understanding of the
need for legislation of this kind and of the
injustices which might occur were the law to
continue in its present form. The bill relates
entirely to the question of the right of a
citizen to bring an action for damages against
the crown.
As all honourable senators know, there is
an old doctrine, which in its constitutional
application, is still sound, that "the king can
do no wrong." The king himself was the
fountain-head of justice. Until recently, when
legislation was passed to abolish such appeals,
it was said, when we wanted to appeal to the
Privy Council, tha.t we would "carry the case
to the foot of the throne," because the Privy
Council was a committee acting on behalf of
His Majesty the King, or, as it would be now,
Her Majesty the Queen. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council heard these cases
and made a representation to the sovereign,
who acted according to its recommendations.
By that theory, no private citizen could bring
any action against the crown. In the early
days, that prohibition was modified by what
was known as a fiat. A petition of right would
be submitted to His or Her Majesty's government. Upon investigation, if the government
of the day should so recommend to the crown,
a fiat would be issued. The simple words
would be endorsed on the petition, "Let
justice be done." When that fiat was issued,
an action, within certain limitations, could be
brought. The first time this provision received
statutory recognition in Canada was in the
year 1876. The Petition of Right Act was
brought in by Mr. Blake, who was then
Minister of Justice, and it enabled a private
citizen to bring an action against Her Majesty
the Queen only on a fiat order, and on certain
limited grounds. That was the means by
which a man could make a claim against
the crown. Of course you will understand
that when I say "the crown", I mean the
state, with the sovereign as head, having
possession of lands or money upon which a
private citizen has a right or a claim by
reason of a breach of contract. So, by virtue
of this statute, a private citizen was entitled

to petition the crown to be allowed to bring
an action to assert his rights to lands or to
Hccould
enforce tus rights under d ctrtact.
bring an action under those circumstances
after the issue of a fiat, but he had no right
of action in tort. I take it that all honourable
senators know what I mean by an action in
tort.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I don't.
Hon. Mr. Farris: It is an action for damages.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Farris: And it may be based on
many grounds. In 1887-I think Sir John
Thompson was then Minister of Justicethe Exchequer Court Act was amended to
extend the jurisdiction of that court to actions
in tort against the crown, subject to two
conditions. First, the issuance of a fiat; that
is, the recommendation of the Minister of
Justice to the sovereign that a fiat be issued,
and when leave was given the petition was
endorsed "Let justice be done." The second
condition, a very broad one, limited an action
in tort to one based on negligence. I should
explain that there are other torts than mere
acts of negligence. Honourable senators are
familiar with the ordinary case of negligence,
such as that resulting from an automobile
accident. For instance, if I drive my automobile carelessly and without regard to traffic
regulations, and hurt somebody, that person
has a right to sue me in tort for damages,
based on negligence, which is a violation of
the ordinary obligation to take care.
That was the law of 1887, and it continued in force without variation until 1950.
Honourable senators will appreciate the
change in conditions which occurred during
those years. In 1887 the crown had a very
restricted field of activity; but later, and
especially after the First Great War, the
activities of the crown became so extensive
that the limitations I have mentioned resulted
in an intolerable injustice to the citizen.
Therefore, in 1950 an act was passed by which
crown corporations became subject in the
same manner as private persons to actions
in provincial courts for damages. In view
of the extent of these creatures known as
crown corporations, it was only a matter of
common sense and decency that the Statute
Law Amendment Act of 1950 should be passed.
In 1951 the Petition of Right Act was
amended to do away with fiats; in other
words, a writ could be issued against the
crown in the same way as it is issued against
an individual every day in the courts throughout our land. Action, however, had to be
taken in the Exchequer Court of Canada,
because that court had exclusive jurisdiction
to decide claims against the crown.

MARCH 31, 1953
While the law as it then stood did away
with the necessity for securing a fiat, it did
not get rid of the restrictions imposed by
the Act of 1887, namely that the only kind
of damages that could be claimed was with
respect to property, or as a result of breach
of contract, or for torts arising from negligence. The right of action in tort was still
limited to negligence. For instance, if the
crown was guilty of causing a nuisance
which resulted in injury to the life or health
of a citizen, he had no right of action against
the crown, regardless of whether he secured
a flat.
The bill now before us-and I refer particularly to section 3 of Part I-eliminates
negligence as the sole ground of action in tort.
The result, upon the passage of this measure,
will be that any action in tort can be brought
against the crown as the representative of
the state, without securing a fiat.
In order to illustrate the extent to which
an action in tort can be taken under this
legislation I should like to refer to what
the honourable Minister of Justice had to
say when the bill was before the other house
on second reading. First, I would again
remind honourable senators that heretofore
an action could rbe brought for negligence, but
.cor no other fori of tort. The minister said
that upon the passage of this measure actions
can be brought against the crown based on:
(a) negligence;
assault-

(b)

nuisance;

(c)

trespass;

(d)

Her Majesty would of course not be guilty
of assault, but an agent of the crown, believing he was performing his proper duty, might
commit assault. Other types of actions coming within the classification of torts, as
pointed out by the minister, are:
(e) false imprisonment and false arrest; (f)
malicious prosecution; (g) libel and slander; (h)
deceit; (1) interference with contract rights; (j)
trover and conversion; (k) slander of title (1)
infringement of patent.

I have no doubt that the Honourable Mr.
Garson did not exhaust all possible claims
for which action in tort may exist. But
whatever they are, upon the passage of this
bill any right of action that a private citizen
has against another citizen he will have
against the crown.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask my honourable
friend a question? Reference has been made
to an action for false imprisonment. If a
man were accused of murder, committed to
jail, tried and found not guilty, would, he
have a right of action against the crown?
Hon. Mr. Farris: He would have the same
right of action against the crown as he
would have against a private citizen. But it
must be remembered that a right of action for

false imprisonment does not exist merely
because a man has been charged with murder and found not guilty.
In order to
prove malicious prosecution an action must
be founded on something more than a verdict
of not guilty. If, for instance, on proper
grounds, I suspected my honourable friend
to be guilty of some offenceHon. Mr. Beaubien: And he is.
Hon. Mr. Farris: -not neccessarily murderHon. Mr. Euler: Make it something a little
less serious!
Hon. Mr. Farris: -and I had an honest
belief that he was guilty, and I laid a charge
against him, but not through spite, the fact
that he was acquitted would not give him any
right of action against me. In such a case I
would have done only what it was my duty to
do. But if deliberately, maliciously, out of
spite, I tried to get even with my honourable
friend by laying a charge against him, and he
was prosecuted and acquitted, he would have,
under proper circumstances, a right of action
against me for malicious prosecution.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Was that not always the
law?
Hon. Mr. Farris: Not as against the crown.
All I am saying now is that the rights and
remedies heretofore available to one citizen
against another citizen are now extended to
apply against the state, so that if an official
acting purportedly on behalf of the state
does one of these wrongful acts, the state
can be sued as though it were a private
citizen.
There are other provisions; but that is the
sum and substance of this legislation.
I do not know whether honourable senators
want to send this bill to committee. My own
opinion is that it should go there. In the
debate on the bill in the other house there
was considerable discussion about certain
matters. For example, it is provided, subject
to one exception, that all actions against the
state shall be brought in the Exchequer Court.
The exception is that if a claim for damages
is for less than $1,000 it can be brought in
a county or district court of a province.
The reason is obvious. There would be no
sense in putting a litigant to the expense and
trouble of prosecuting a claim for so small
an amount in the Exchequer Court, with its
headquarters here in Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. Euler: It would cost more than
a thousand dollars to hire lawyers to come
here.
Hon. Mr. Farris: That is right. The question was raised in the other place, why not

SENATE
allow all these actions to be brought in our
nrdinnry courts?

The

answer was-and I

think it is reasonable-that the practice has
been to bring almost all actions against the
crown in the Exchequer Court. The court
was really set up for this purpose, and as
long as it exists its natural jurisdiction, with
minor exceptions, is over claims of this kind.
Sometimes I wonder whether it would not be
better to make all actions triable in our
ordinary courts and dispense with the necessity of a special tribunal to deal with crown
matters; but that is not relevant to the present
discussion.
Another question which came up in the
other place was whether the crown should be
compelled to give compensation for wrongful
conviction and imprisonment: for example,
a man has been wrongfully convicted anc
after he has served a term of five years in a
penitentiary it is discovered that he was not
guilty. But in my opinion the application
of a new principle may be hampered or
obscured if at the start it is made to cover
too much. All of us have known that when
advanced legislation is brought in there are
people who say, "This does not go far enough;
we ought to do this, or that". I do not say
that this was the reasoning followed in
another place, but that sort of thing happens
sometimes. In any event, I doubt very much
whether, under such circumstances, it is the
federal crown that is affected. The prosecution of crime is vested in the attorney general
of the provinces: the juries are selected in the
provinces: and, although the judges are
appointed by the crown, they may be said
to be functioning as heads of provincial
courts. But whether that be so or not, I am
sure that this house will endorse the sentiment in the other house that this is not the
time or place to consider that question. Let
us get this new principle thoroughly
established; let us have it recognized once and
for all that in these modern times, when the
crown, through the state, controls great activities with a wide extent of operations, the
citizen's rights as against the state are no less
than his rights against his neighbour. As
time goes on, if other incidental matters arise,
amendments can be made.
Hon. Mr. Reid: If this bill should become
law will it affect the crown jurisdiction of
the provincial governments?
Hon. Mr. Farris: No. As a matter of fact,
at least four provinces have done away with
the fiat. Whether their legislation on these
lines is as extensive as that contained in this
bill, I doubt. But that is not our affair. We
have no jurisdiction to impose or exempt liability in regard to provincial matters.

The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable

sena-

tors, when shah1 the bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: There is no urgency
about this legislation. I have so advised the
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck). I am willing to have
it sent to committee, or held over for further
discussion, or given third reading at this
time. I should like to have the opinion of
the bouse.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I spoke at some length
on this matter in 1951, when the fiat provision
was repeated. At that time I raised quite
a number of points, and I am pleased to see
that the bill rectifies several matters which
at that time I thought should be changed.
But I am not ready to speak to the bill at
this time, and I do not think it should be
rushed through. I am very much in favour
of sending it to committee. There will be
plenty of time to dispose of it after we resume
on April 14.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I move that the bill be referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.

The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

Divorce, re the petition of Domina Emerius
Lef ebvre.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine moved that the report be
concurred in.
68112-25

Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: Honourable senators,
I notice that the committee's 232nd report
contains this statement:
The committee recommend the passage of an Act
to dissolve the marriage, Senator George Henry
Ross dissenting.
I wonder if the honourable senator from

Calgary (Hon. Mr. Ross) would be good
enough to state why he dissented.
Hon. Mr. Ross: Honourable senators, this
places me in a rather awkward position. I
was Acting Chairman of the committee that
heard this petition. The two other members
of the committee were of the opinion that a
divorce should be granted. I did not think
it was a proper case for divorce, and for that
reason I dissented. As I am still of that
opinion, I cannot concur in the report of the
committee.
In order to give my reasons for dissenting
it will be necessary for me to review the
evidence in the case; and as the matter is
still fresh in my memory I think I can do
that briefly. If I should err in my statement
of any of the facts I hope the other members
of the committee will correct me as I go along.
The first witness called was the petitioner,
who said that he had married the respondent
in 1915, that they had lived together for
fourteen years, and then separated. After
they separated the petitioner began living
with a seventeen-year-old girl, and they lived
together as man and wife for three years.
Later he began living with a sixteen-year-old
girl, and they lived together as man and
wife for nine years, or until 1945. In that
year he petitioned parliament for a divorce,
but his application was refused. The petitioner further said he continued to live with
this young girl for a period of three months,
but that they did not cohabit during that
period.
Two detectives testified that while on their
way home from some other business at ten
minutes to four one morning they saw a light
in the upstairs of the house where the
respondent lived. They parked their car and
went to the house. One of them said he
climbed up on the balcony and, looking in
the window, saw the respondent and a man
undressing. The other detective testified that
he then got up on the balcony and that he
also saw a man in there in the nude and a
woman undressing. One of the detectives said
that he later went to the respondent's house
and got into a controversy with her, and that
she ordered him out. That is perhaps as far
as I need to go with that phase of the case,
because, if the evidence of the detectives is
to be believed, adultery is proved.

SENATE
In her defence the respondent testified on
her own behalf -nd denied that there was
any light in the room at ten minutes to four
in the morning or that there was a man in
the room with her. In effect, she denied any
allegations that would tend to prove adultery
on her part. Her evidence was that to help
her to pay her rent and household expenses
she had two roomers, one of whom had
resided at her home seven, the other five,
years. The one who had been there for five
years is the person with whom she was supposed to have been when the detectives-if
they are to be believed-looked through the
window and saw her. It was a little later
that the woman ordered one of the detectives
out of the house.
I am asked why I dissented. The reason
is that I believed the story of the woman.
Except for the evidence of the two detectives
and of her husband, the evidence disclosed no
reflection on her character. She gave her
testimony in a direct and straightforward
way; and it was my conclusion and still is
that she is a good woman.
Both roomers stated that they were awakened by the ringing of the door-bell. The
roorner who had lodged at her place for
five years denied absolutely that he had been
in her room and stated that he did not know
anything about the light referred to. He too
gave his evidence in a frank and straightforward way, and I believed him.
One of the detectives who had been at
the house at about 4.10 returned there later
and rang the door-bell. The woman of the
house went to the door and there was some
controversial discussion between them, after
which the woman ordered him out. One of
the roomers who had been awakened by the
ringing of the door-bell stated that he heard
a conversation going on but did not catch
what was being said, except that he heard
the woman order the detective out. He
further stated that the detective did not
leave, upon which the woman again told him
to go, using some expression as "Get the hell
out of here".
The other roomer also testified that the
woman's record was a very fine one. His
evidence impressed me as honest and reliable.
In short, as I believed the statements of
the respondent and her witnesses, I could
not support the recommendation that a
divorce be granted.
Looking at the probabilities I could not
It
credit the evidence of the detectives.
seemed unreasonable to me that the respondent and that man would be undressing
together in her room at ten minutes to four in
the morning, with light turned on. These

people had been living in the same house for
five years, and if they had wanted to get
d
together tney wouid nuL ave had tdo what
has been alleged. That view cast strong
doubt in my mind on the evidence of the
detectives.
Another point is that in the courts, at
least in my province, a person suing for a
divorce has to corne with a comparatively
clean record. A man who has ruined the
lives of two young girls has not a clean
record. Apart from all other matters, I
personally would have refused the granting of
the divorce on that ground alone; but in
reaching my own decision I relied solely on
the evidence.
A few days after the case was heard, and
after the committee had decided to recommend the petition, but before the committee's
report had been presented to the Senate,
a certain Montreal lawyer telephoned me that
he had been consulted by the respondent,
who wished to have further evidence adduced.
He assured me this evidence would be of a
material nature and that, in his opinion, it
would influence the members of the committee. Under these circumstances, when the
committee's report was brought into the
Senate I moved that it be referred back to
the committee for further consideration. I
did not think it was my place to decide
whether further evidence should be heard.
My motion was agreed to, and the committee
fixed a date for the hearing of counsel on
the question of whether the case should be
reopened.
Counsel for both the petitioner and respondent appea'red, and counsel for the respondent
gave four main reasons why the case should
be reopened. First, he said that the detectives, if standing on the balcony, could not
look into the upstairs window and see what
was going on. Secondly, he said that if a
detective could get up and look into the
upstairs window he could not see into the
particular room where the alleged act was
supposed to have taken place. Thirdly, counsel for the respondent wanted to call the
younger of the two girls with whom the
petitioner had gone to live. He said that
he would adduce evidence from her that
the petitioner had had sexual relations with
her in 1951. Finally, he said that the petitioner's counsel had taken up the matter with
the respondent and wanted her to bring an
action for divorce against her husband. Evidently the husband was prepared to make
a settlement and pay her alimony if she
would bring a divorce action against him.
The petitioner's lawyer produced a photograph in which someone appeared to be
standing on the verandah of a house, looking
into a window, but there was no evidence

APRIL
before us that this was the house or window
in question. The lawyer argued that it was
possible to see into the room, so probably
there would have been a conflict of testimony
on that point. He contended that the reasons
advanced for reopening the case were frivolous and that the purpose in presenting them
was to delay disposition of the case. He
said that there was no necessity for hearing
further evidence, and that was the feeling of
the committee.
Honourable members, I believe I have
stated enough to explain why I feel that,
this divorce petition should not be granted.
Hon. W. H. Golding: Honourable senators,
I certainly regret that it has been found
necessary to discuss in this chamber the
details of a divorce case. It is most unusual.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Golding: In the other bouse discussions on divorce have always been confined to a general question of whether parliament should be asked to grant divorces. I
never heard the evidence of a divorce case
reviewed on the floor of that chamber.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Nor did I.
Hon. Mr. Golding: Unfortunately the Acting Chairman of the Divorce Committee (Hon.
Mr. Ross) has found it necessary to discuss
the evidence of a certain case. As one who
recommended that this petition be granted,
I feel I should justify my stand. Many
couples seem to find it impossible to get
along together, and so it was with these
people. They were married in 1915 and
apparently their troubles started just three
years later. They separated in 1929 and
have lived apart ever since. In 1945 the
petitioner came to parliament seeking a
divorce, but at that time he did not produce
sufficient evidence. He based his allegations
on incidents that took place back in the
year 1918, when his brother was living with
him.
In the present case reference was made to
the situation in 1945, when he came here to
seek a divorce. I looked up all the evidence.
He stated in evidence at that time that his
application was made because of adultery
having been committed by his wife. Well,
I found that the adultery alleged at that time
was between his brother and his wife, and
on another occasion as well. The whole
situation was an unhappy one, dating from
the year 1918. From my observation, I do not
think that any of those people were in too
high a grade-if you want to grade human
beings-but we had to find on the evidence
which was given. Two detectives gave
evidence, and there was a conflict of testimony, as there usually is.
68112-25j

1, 1953
After we had given our decision, I was
approached, and it was pointed out to me
very emphatically that it was impossible for
the detectives to have looked in the window
as they said they did. The senator from
Calgary (Hon. Mr. Ross) referred to an
upstairs window. But the window in question
was on the ground floor. There were steps
up to the front door, and there was a railing
around a platform. The detectives claimed
that they stepped over that railing and looked
into this window. As I say, I was told that
it was impossible for them to do that. But
when this matter was referred to the committee, photographs were produced of the
same two detectives looking in the window.
I hope no one will insinuate it was not the
same bouse, for there can be no question in
the world that it was.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask if these photographs were disputed at the second hearing?
Hon. Mr. Golding: No, they were not disputed at all.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is significant.
Hon. Mr. Golding: But statements were
made about the case which were not according to fact. I was told that the man in the
room was a young mar. That is not true.
The woman was 55, and the man was 54.
When the case was referred back to the
committee for further consideration, a lawyer
told us again that the detectives could not
have looked in that window.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Would the honourable
senator allow me to ask a question? Was
the case referred back to the committee this
session?
Hon. Mr. Golding: Yes.
The lawyer stated that they could not look
in the window. After he was handed the
photographs showing them there looking in
the window, he said, "Well, they couldn't
see anything even if they did look in." But
the fact is, there was an arch with a curtain,
and then the bedroom, and the detectives
allege that the curtain was not drawn at that
time. At the hearing the other day a photograph was produced showing the curtain
drawn.
It was stated that a woman was going to
come and give evidence of having been with
the petitioner in 1951. But the petitioner and
a man who has been living with him since
1946-that is, for six years-both swore there
was no woman living there at all, and that
they were doing their own housekeeping and
chores. That is the sworn evidence.
When the committee is sitting, anyone who
has evidence to give in a case should take

SENATE
advantage of his or her right to appear before
the committee in

thp witnes

box and make

statements under oath. That is the only fair
way, because then the committee will have
the evidence before it, and will try to decide
the case on that evidence.
I regret having had to say even as much
as I have said, because I think that the details
of divorce cases should not be discussed here
at all. In this particular case we gave our
judgment on the evidence that we had at the
time, and when the case was returned and
reviewed we were still of the same opinion
as before. That is as far as our duty and
responsibility go.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Honourable senators, I move
in amendment that the report be not considered now but that consideration thereof
be postponed until the 15th of April.
It is not customary for honourable senators
to consider evidence taken at sittings of
the Divorce Committee. The chairman and
another member of the committee that heard
this case have given an oral report to the
house this afternoon. What has been said
here will appear in Hansard, and I think that
this, when read in conjunction with the
evidence-though divorce evidence is generally not read by honourable senators, except
those who are members of the committeewill be of considerable assistance to us when
the matter comes before us for further consideration.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
I regret as much as anyone the difficulty that
has arisen in connection with this divorce
report.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: As I may not be in
the chamber on April 15 next, I should like
to speak to the matter at this time.
I was unable to attend the hearing of this
petition. The committee that dealt with it
was presided over by the honourable senator
from Calgary (Hon. Mr. Ross), as Acting
Chairman, and the other members were the
honourable senators from Huron-Perth (Hon.
Mr. Golding) and Prince Albert (Hon. Mr.
These honourable gentlemen
Stevenson).
have all had considerable experience in matters of this kind. Upon my return to Ottawa
I read the transcript of the evidence carefully
and came to the same conclusion as did the
two members who made the majority report.
In my opinion the decision in this case was
largely a matter within the discretion of the
committee. The majority took into consideration the fact that the parties had been
separated since 1919, and that the general
conduct of both had been censurable. The

majority apparently felt, therefore, that these
people should not continue to be tied together
by the matrimonial bonds.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: And for that reason they
recommended that the petition be granted.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Does my honourable
friend suggest that a divorce should be
granted on compassionate grounds?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No, no.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Then what does he mean?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I agree with the decision
of the majority of the committee, that there
was ample evidence on which to grant a
divorce. I point out, however, that as I
did not see the witnesses or hear their evidence, I am not in as good a position as they
are to pass on the facts. Rather, I am somewhat in the position of a court of appeal
which only reads the evidence taken at the
hearing, listens to argument and comes to
a decision.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, before
a vote is taken I should like to say a word
or two.
Although I have been in one or other of the
two houses of parliament since 1930, this is
the first time I have heard the facts of a
divorce case discussed in either house. Some
honourable senators may not agree with what
I have to say. Nevertheless I draw attention
to the fact that some members of this house
for reasons of their own-and I recognize
those reasons-refuse to become members of
the divorce committee, though they may sometimes choose to sit in and listen to a particular
case. Where are their scruples? While this
case is being discussed in the chamber today,
those honourable senators are sitting, as it
were, in judgment on it. From what I have
heard of it, I must confess that I am in no
position to pass judgment one way or the
other.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: And I do not think that any
senator who is not a member of that committee could come to an honest opinion on
the case. However, I see no justification for
the stand taken by the Acting Chairman of
the committee. All of us have at times had
to bow to the wishes of a majority vote. As
a matter of fact, I have seldom been in the
majority on any question.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: But I always bow to the
wishes of the majority, though not always
kindly. In this case the majority recommended that the petition be granted, and

APRIL 1. 1953
after the case has been reconsidered by tbem
they stili so recommend.
1 asked one of the members of that committee wbether the photograpbs which were
displayed were disputed, and he said that
they were not.
Hon. Mr. Ross: We were nlot receiving evidence at that time; we were merely hearing
representations by counsel
Hon. Mr. Reid: I realize that, but the photographs were displayed, whether they were
accepted or nlot.
I corne back to rny original point, that not
one of us, apart; from the members of the
comrnittee who heard the case, is in a position to pass judgment on it. If the discussion
in this chamber is a criterion of what may
arise in future cases, it augurs iii for the
carrying on of the work of the Divorce Committee.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I think something should be said in
defenoe of the position taken by the Acting
Chairman of the Standing Cornmittee on
Divorce (Hon. Mr. Ross), particularly in view
of the remarks of the member frorn New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid).
An honourable senator rnay function in
two capacities in connection with a matter
of this nature: first, he may serve as a
member of the cornmittee; and second, he
may participate in the debates in this chamber. Because an honourable senator sits as
a member of a comrnittee, his hands are not
tied when a report from. that cornmittee is
before the house. If that were not so,' a
senator might hesitate to take his place on
a cornmittee. The Acting Chairman of the
Divorce Committee is, in my opinion, entirely
justified in the position he now takes. He
disagreed with the mai ority opinion of the
,committee, and he stili disagrees, and he now
gives bis reasons for doing so. The resuit is
that the decision of the comrnittee has been
passed to this general assembly, and each
one of us bears his responsibility in regard
to it.
The discussion here today is the first mention I have heard of this case. I arn therefore not in a position to pass judgrnent on it,
and I support fully the amendment that consideration of the report should stand, until
after the Easter recess.
I have just now been handed a copy of the
evidýence, which I have had no opportunity
to read. I should like to review the record
carefully, s0 that after the recess I may be
in a position, in the light of ail the facts
accurnulated, to give rny best judgrnent on
the matter.

Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: Honourable senators, this case seerns to have provoked considerable debate. I should just like to point
out that when a court case which has been
beard by tbree judges is decided, iA is not
unusual for the court to divide two to one.
I have read the report in this case, and my
impression is that serne of the witnesses
swore falsely. In my opinion there seerns to
have been sorne kind of frarne-up against
the respondent. Therefore, I share the view
held by the Acting Chairman (Hon. Mr. Ross).
As honourable senators know, I arn wholly
against divorce under any circurnstances, and
I do not like to hear these things a.ired in this
honourable chamber.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: We are not debating the
general question of divorce.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators, I
happen to be a member of the Divorce Committee, but it usually divides into two sections and I was not on the section that heard
this particular case. 1 arn in favour of
accepting the opinion of the rnajority of the
cornrittee. I do not see what else we can
do unless we as a Senate are to review al
the evidence; and I agree with those who
regret that a debate of this kind should be
held at ail. I have a great deal of respect
for the senator from Calgary (Hon. Mr. Ross),
who functioned as Acting Chairman of the
comrnittee when this case was considered,
and I have no iess respect for the two other
members. Under those circurnstances wbat
arn I to do? The senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) has said that he
would like to read over the evidence. When
each of us has read that evidence are we to
corne back here and have a complete discussion of ail the details?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I hope not.
Hon. Mr. Euler: So do I. The Chairman of
the cornrittee, the senator frorn Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine), who bas read the
evidence, is of the sarne opinion as the
majority of that cornrittee; and I have a
good deal of confidence in his judgrnent. I
arn not imputing any blarne to the Acting
Chairman because he believes that the respondent told the trutb and that those who
testified against bier did not tell tbe truth;
but -tbe other two members seemed to believe
those wbo were called to support the petition.
On the basis of the evidence itself, then, I as
a member of this chamber arn quite willing
to accept the opinion of the rnajority. In this
country the mai ority is supposed to rule.
I will go a littie further, because there is
another consideration whicb to rny mind is

APRIL 1, 1953
Hon. Mr. Haig: But there is no question
about it: our duty as senators is to read the
evidence, to come to our own personal conclusions, and be prepared to vote. At the
same time, in reading the evidence there are
certain considerations to be kept in mind.
Apart from those honourable senators who
are members of the committee, none of us
sees or hears any of the witnesses.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That makes the difference.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The committee, or a judge
who sees witnesses, is in a much better position to decide whether the witnesses for the
petitioner or those for the respondent are
lying. Speaking from a long experience-for
I suppose that in the eighteen years I was
Chairman of the Divorce Committee I heard
fifteen hundred cases-I never found any
difficulty, after seeing the witnesses on the
stand and hearing their testimony, in deciding who was telling the truth and who was
not. I think that in this matter a lawyer is
somewhat better equipped than a layman, not
because he is personally more competent, but
because of his experience in dealing day by
day with this or that client. Sometimes when
a person gives his story you intuitively say
to yourself "That does not sound reasonable,"
and as a result of further questioning you
come to the conclusion that he bas no case
at all. When you serve on the Divorce Committee you adopt an impartial attitude, but
while listening to the evidence you are able
to make up your mind as to who is telling
the truth.
There is a difficulty in asking this house
to vote on matters of divorce, for some honourable members do not believe in divorce
at all. This is their perfect right, but it
makes it difficult for them to vote.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The Senate is not able to
act as an impartial body on these occasions.

absent themselves from the bouse when a
vote is taken?
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not feel I have the
right to go so far as to make that suggestion.
Honourable senators, I hate this whole
divorce business, and I feel it is an imposition
on the public life of Canada to saddle the
federal parliament with this work. The
sooner each province has its own divorce
jurisdiction the better it will be for all of
Canada. You do not have to listen to many
divorce cases to see what a dirty business it
is, but let us not forget that we all have a
responsibility to discharge. I for one am
ready to carry out that responsibility. A
few years ago a distinguished member of
the other house, a former judge, said that
whenever he sat in judgment on a divorce
case he utterly disregarded the fact that he
was personally opposed to divorce, and I
think honourable senators should adopt the
same attitude here.
I am in favour of the amendment of the
honourable senator from De Lorimier (Hon.
Mr. Vien).
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Vien was
agreed to, on division.

of $6 million; and in 1952 there was a
deficit of ten times that amount. This means
that Canadians spent in 1952 on tourist travel
outside of Canada $60 million more than
tourists from the United States and elsewhere spent in Canada. I am quoting figures
which were given to the press a few days
ago by the Dominion Bureau of Statisties.
What is the explanation of that remarkable
change? Probably one explanation is the
improved position of the Canadian dollar.
Canadians now feel they can get more for
their dollar in travel outside of Canada. We
know that during the winter months thousands
of our people take a vacation in Florida,
California, Arizona and other southern states;
and also there is a very considerable movement in the winter from western Canada to
Hawaii, one of the territorial possessions of
the United States. On the other hand, except
in the months of June, July and August and
September, Canada is seldom visited by
tourists from abroad. In the winter season
there is skiing in the Laurentians and at
Banff and in other parts of western Canada,
but I doubt if these resorts are patronized
widely by people from outside of Canada.
Ours is really a four-month tourist country,
whereas parts of the United States attract
tourists throughout the year.
The head of the Travel Bureau quoted to
the Tourist Traffic Committee a statement
from a committee of the United Nations. I
have not the exact figure, but as I recall it he
said that Canadians spent on tourist travel
$5 more per capita than the people of the
United States. That is remarkable; it shows
that we are travel-minded in this country.
Not only do our people travel in the United
States of America, but they travel to Europe
in large numbers. More and more of them
have been going there every year. They
also winter in the West Indies, perhaps almost
as much as in the southern states. Nevertheless, we still have the tourist revenue goal of
$500 million, and the question is, how are we
going to reach it? Can we get that much
business during the four summer months of
tourist traffic, or shall we have to develop
our winter trade to help reach the objective?
These are matters which the Standing Committee on Tourist Traffic must consider.
When the Canadian Government Travel
Bureau was created, at the instance of a
special committee of the Senate, it was given
the modest appropriation of $150,000 to be
expended on the development of tourist trade
in Canada, but now the bureau's publicity
alone 'costs nearly $1 million. And on that
item we are not wasting money: the publications in which the advertising is placed, and
the publications issued by the bureau, are
reaching a large number of people throughout
the United States who say that it is splendid

advertising. But it has not brought us $500
million worth of tourist trade.
In the light of the discussion which took
place in our special committee of 1934, we
should recall the setting up of the Standing
Committee on Tourist Traffic and the creation
of the Canadian Government Travel Bureau,
which resulted from the committee's recommendations.
A travel bureau is not a unique organization today. I suppose that every state in the
American union has such a bureau for the
purposes of promoting tourist traffic; and
every province in Canada has its own organization, each doing its utmost to attract visitors to that province. I am told that every
country in Europe has a travel bureau, most of
them under government auspices. So Canada
is not distinctive in this regard. However, the
Senate, which at times is not given much
attention, is the only legislative body that I
know of on this or any other continent that
has a committee devoted to the study of the
tourist business, to the hearing of evidence and the making of recommendations.
Further, it is notable that a body which is
sometimes called aged is dealing with this
modern subject which requires the inspiration and vigour of youth. I think it is a
compliment to the Senate that we have such
a committee and that we continue to be interested in the promotion of tourist business.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: When our Travel
Bureau was established, a most aggressive
man, Mr. Leo Dolan, who has become well
known all over the continent, was appointed
as its head, and I may say that he has never
at any time let Canada down.
A further recommendation which came out
of the special committee of 1934 was that
Canada should have more national parks. It
was pointed out at that time-and this was
before Newfoundland came into Confederation
-that none of the Atlantic coast provinces
had a national park. We are now into 1953,
and every maritime province, with the exception of Newfoundland, has a national park.
They are all attracting tourists and will
attract more as people become acquainted
with the varied beauties of the parks. I look
to the day when the new province of Newfoundland also will have its own national
park. From what I have read and heard of
that province I am sure it has scenic beauty
as good as or better than is to be found elsewhere in Canada. When I hear someone talk
about the fishing on the Humber River and
the scenery of that area, I can envision the
day when it will be set aside as a national
park.
We are entitled to credit for the report of
that special committee-I say this not as an

recommendations have been adopted. Tiuc,

towards the acquisition of better highways,
through the construction of the Trans-Canada
highway. My feeling, honourable senators, is
and will continue to be that if we are to reach
the objective of $500 million from tourist
business we must have better roads from
coast to coast. It should be made unnecessary for tourists travelling east or west to go
through the United States and there spend
some of their money before reaching our
western or eastern provinces.
I think that if today Canadians lack
national understanding it is because they do
not know their own country well enough.
There are countless people in western and
central Canada who have never visited the
Maritime provinces; and no doubt it can be
said that many people living in the eastern
provinces have never visited central or
western Canada.
A few years ago I made my first trip to
Prince Edward Island, and while in Charlottetown I went to see the parliament buildings
and the chamber so historically connected
with the creation of this great confederation
of Canada. I felt at that moment it was
a real pity that more of our Canadians did
not visit that historic chamber, and likewise
the citadel in Quebec City. I love to roam
around the province of Quebec, not only in
its cities but throughout the countryside. But
I wonder how many of our people have visited
the memorial at St.-Lin, commemorating the
birthplace of that great statesman, Sir Wilfrid
Laurier. It is most interesting to view the
humble home and surroundings in which he
began his life. Our people should also go to
see Kingston, the burial place of Sir John A.
Macdonald. They should make of such places
a shrine, and there pay their respects to our
great men, just as the American people pay
their respect at Mount Vernon to the memory
of Washington, at Monticello to the memory
of Jefferson, and at the many memorials
which stand as a tribute to Lincoln. We
must build up in Canada a strong Canadian
spirit, and a loyalty to the memory of the
men who have served us in the past. We can
best do this by visiting the places where they
lived and learning something about their
beginnings. Most of them started in a humble
way and rose to positions of prominence in
Canadian life by rendering services which
will be of lasting benefit. The greater the
distance which divides us from the period in
which they served, the more we value what
they have done for us.

The honourable senator from Medicine Hat
(Hon. Mr. Gershaw) made some reference to

Board

There will be an opportunity for honourable
senators later on to discuss this organization,
as, I understand, a bill dealing with it will
shortly be before us. Historic sites are spread
all over the country. I like to think of those
that are associated with individuals who by
their statesmanship laid the foundations of
Canada. I think also with admiration of
those men who participated in the discovery
of this country, who in the early days faced
all the trials and hazards of exploration. We
should have memorials of these men that
are appropriate to their great achievements.
There is another aspect of this commemorative work which should be helpful in attracting tourists. I cite a local instance because,
in thinking of these things, one inevitably
reverts to the part of the world in which one
lives. Not very far from the city in which
I live is a mass of rock which resembles
more than anything else the worst ruin that
could be created by an atomic bomb. Possibly
it is not the kind of site which the board could
appropriately mark, but nevertheless it is,
I imagine, potentially of great interest to
tourists. Most people who pass through that
locality would be unlikely to know its significance; but it marks the place where the top
of a mountain fell on a mining village. My
honourable friend from Kootenay East (Hon.
Mr. King) is in a better position to give the
particulars; but in a word, the avalanche
wiped out the village of Frank, in the Crowsnest Pass, and all that can be seen today
is a great mass of rock.
I recall having noticed many years ago
a little cabin amongst some trees near the
old Canadian Pacific Railway hotel at Banff.
I inquired to whom it belonged, and was told
that it had formerly been used by Sir John
A. Macdonald, who had then been dead for
some time. I do not know whether the
cabin is still in existence, but if it is it should
be preserved as a feature associated with
Banff National Park,-itself, I think I am
right in saying, the first of our national parks.
The late Hayter Reed, who was well known
in Western Canada, and for some time connected with the Canadian Pacific Railway at
Banff, made it his business to see that this
little cabin was set aside for the use of
the man who was then Prime Minister of
Canada. If it is still there it should be
preserved.
I end on the theme which I have been
trying to emphasize. We have been talking
about how to attract tourists from outside
Canada, in the hope that they will spend
more money and enable us to attain that

APRIL 1, 1953
$500 million objective; but I believe it would
be well to concentrate a little more on ways
and means of encouraging our own people to
move from one end of the country to the
other. This they cannot do unless there is a
Trans-Canada highway. I do not think that
a man in Alberta who wants to see Prince
Edward Island or some other part of Eastern
Canada should have to make a great part of
his motor tour through the United States. At
the present time he is apt to say "I will go
down to Coutts, cross Montana., travel to, say,
Port Huron, and cross the St. Clair river
into Ontario". By this route he travels as
much through the United States of America
as he will travel in Canada. If a Canadian
wants to tour in the United States, well and
good, but if his purpose is to see as much as
he can of his own country it is to be hoped
that the time will soon arrive when he will
be served by a direct all-Canadian route. All
through northern Ontario, which the road
must penetrate some time or other, will be
found great riches of natural beauty in lakes
and streams and forests, as well as abundant
opportunities of fishing. Once a road bas been
constructed through that area there should
not be much difficulty about completing the
Trans-Canada highway. As I see the matter,
a nation of intelligent Canadians wellinformed about their country at large and
understanding the problems of the various
provinces, will not be possible unless our
people are able to move around and become
acquainted with all parts of Canada, their
resources and their problems. One of the
values I have derived from public life over
the many years I have been coming to Ottawa
is the opportunity of meeting people from the
far east as well as the far west, because
through that acquaintanceship I have come
to know Canada better. Would not similar
benefits accrue to any Canadian citizen who,
with an adequate highway system, could
move around by automobile from place to
place in his own country?
There are also, of course, great attractions
in parts of Canada which cannot be reached
by automobile but which are now accessible
by other means of transportation. There is
Churchill, on the Hudson Bay, where, and
only where, most people from the United
States, or Canada itself, may get a glimpse
of the Hudson Bay. There is the great Mackenzie river, flowing through a territory
which in the not remote future may prove
the richest area of Canada, and to which
travellers may go by aeroplane or steamer.
I have tried to set forth some of the aims
which the Tourist Traffic Committee may be
able to achieve in the years to come-objectives which I think should be in the minds

The motion was agreed to.
FARM IMPROVEMENT LOANS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 143, an Act to amend
the Farm Improvement Loans Act, 1944.
He said: Honourable senators, the Farm
Improvement Loans Act was enacted in 1944.
The purpose of this legislation was to fill a
gap in the credit system which had been
developed to meet the needs of agriculture.
That gap related mainly to the provision of
intermediate credit and certain types of
short-term credit to farmers for the improvement and development of farms, and for the
improvement of living conditions thereon.
The principle of the Act is that the government undertakes to reimburse the chartered
banks for losses incurred on loans made
under the Act up to a maximum amount of
10 per cent of the aggregate principal amount
of loans made by each bank.
The original Act established a limit on the
total amount of loans that may be made
from time to time. The practice has been to
set this over-all limit for three-year periods.
The first period was the three years ended
February 29, 1948, and the limit was set at
$250 million. In that period loans were made
aggregating $35 million.
The second three-year period ended February 28, 1951, and had a limit of $150 million. Of this amount $135 million was loaned.
In March, 1951, the Act was further
extended for a period of three years ending
February 28, 1954. The limit was set at $200
million and practically all that amount bas
now been loaned.
The bill now before us does four things.
First, it shortens the present three-year
period to a period of approximately two
years, ending March 31, 1953. Secondly, it
creates a new three-year period, ending
March 31, 1956. Thirdly, it sets a limit of
$300 million; and fourthly, it raises the maximum loan that may be granted from $3,000
to $4,000.
The success of the operation of the Act is
reflected in the fact that out of $350 million
loaned since the inception of the Act to the
end of December 1952, total losses paid to
banks amounted to only $38,383.93, in respect
of eighty claims, and of this amount over
$2,000 was later recovered from the borrowers.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is the amount
whirh has been written off as the loss, but
that figure does not necessarily indicate the
total losses.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: No. I am only taking
the statement as of the end of the period.
What is in store for the future is another
matter.
The loans made under the act from its
inception to December 31, 1952, have totalled
331,965, and at that date only 28,916 were
in default.
Demands have increased so
sharply recently, however, that during the
first twenty-two months of the current threeyear period over $183 million has been loaned
of the $200 million provided, and it is, therefore, necessary to extend both the amount
and the time limit for the operation of the
act.
Borrowings under the act have been more
numerous in Western provinces than in

approximately $337 million loaned up to
September 30, 1952, over $306 million was
used for buying farm machinery. As is well
known, the cost of combines and tractors for
western operations greatly exceeds the sums
needed for the smaller acreages in the East.
However, during the same period over $16
million has been borrowed to repair farm
buildings, and $81 million for purchase of
livestock.

loans classified by provinces, and with the
consent of the Senate I should like to have

Hansard.

ask honourable members to give this legislation their immediate consideration.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
was not at all impressed by this legislation
when it was first introduced. I feel that we
may have to face a much greater loss than
$38,383.93. As honourable members know,
these loans are made by our chartered banks.
From time to time in my office in Winnipeg I
have been called by officials of these banks
who have said something to this effect: "Back
in 1948 you made a loan to a Mr. Smith for
the purchase of a half section of land. Will
you check your records to see if this farmer
has made his principal and interest payments
whenever they have fallen due?" They also
want to know the amount still owing on the
land. Spring and fall are the two busiest
seasons for making loans under this act,
and bank officials are always checking up on
prospective borrowers. If my memory serves
me rightly they make sure that the farmers
pay one-quarter in cash.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: One-third.

Hon. Mr. Haig: All right, one-third. That
is on the amount to be financed.
If money is to be lent at all for farm
improvements, I do not know of a better way
than how it is being lent now. The farmer
borrowing from his local bank believes, quite
naturally, that he owes the money to the
bank itself. He knows that the bank is
protected by government charter, and as long
as he farms in the same locality he will do
business with the local bank. I could name
a town in Manitoba with only one bank. A
man in that town said to me: "I am surprised
at the punctuality with which payments on
loans are made to the bank by borrowers."
I said, "Well, you had better ask the manager
about it." He went to the manager, who told

improved considerably. Whether or not the
high cost of machinery will be justified if
the price of grain goes down is a matter
about which I shall express no opinion. But
with grain at its present price, machinery
is best financed the way it is now. If it were
not financed by the present method, the
farmer would have to pay a higher rate of
interest to get his machinery-and a great
many would be without machinery. The
present method of financing affords the man
whose credit standing is not too high an
opportunity to buy up-to-date machinery, so
that he can farm side by side with the man
who does not need the same assistance.
I am in f avour of the legislation. I hope
we pass the bill, so that the credits to the
farmers of Canada will be continued.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

APPENDIX "A"
Statement read to the Standing Committee on External Relations

WEDNESDAY,

lst April, 1953
by

Mr. L. D. Wilgress, Under Secretary of State of External Affairs
on the
INTERNATIONAL SITUATION

Introduction
I am grateful for the opportunity to appear
before your committee and to outline some of
the more significant problems in international
relations which are of concern to Canada and
the rest of the free world. Naturally a survey
of this kind cannot hope to be comprehensive
since in the complex and inter-locking world
of today any event in one area may influence
developments half way around the globe.
What I shall try to do is to indicate a few of
the topics which we in the Department of
External Affairs regard as having particular
interest and importance.
Soviet Changes
Throughout the free world the death of
Stalin and the succession of Malenkov have
stirred speculation. These events raise a very
important question: What will be the foreign
policies of the new Soviet regime? I do not
need to emphasize the importance of the
question. You are probably aware, too, of
the wide variety of answers which have been
suggested by many observers of Soviet affairs
in the past two or three weeks.
Let me say at the outset that I do not know
the answer. It may be useful, however, if I
review the circumstances and suggest some
lines of reasoning which appear to be sound.
In the very brief period between Stalin's
death and the announcement of the new composition of the Soviet Government, two
possible courses of future Soviet action were
suggested in the West. One theory was that
if the new régime proved to be weak and
unsure of itself, it might seek to strengthen

its position by rallying the country and the
whole Soviet bloc against an external enemy.
The other theory was that the new régime
might be firmly established, but that it would
nevertheless desire a period of relative calm,
internationally, in order to consolidate its
internal control.
If either of these theories was valid, it was
the second one. For, as we now know, the
question of succession in the Soviet Union was
settled very quickly indeed, and with every
evidence of smoothness and efficiency. Indications that the Soviet leaders might wish to
remove some causes of tension with the West
were forthcoming within a few days. The
absence of the usual tone of belligerency in
the funeral orations made by Messrs. Malenkov, Beria, and Molotov was one indication.
Then on March 15, Mr. Malenkov said before
the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. that there
were no international problems which could
not be resolved by peaceful means. Two
more concrete bits of evidence were the offer
of the Soviet Government to use its good
offices with a view to obtaining the release of
British civilians interned in North Korea,
and the proposal made by General Chuikov
in Berlin that a conference be held to consider ways of avoiding incidents along the air
boundaries of Eastern Europe. There have
also been the developments of the last few
days which hold out the prospect for the
conclusion of an armistice in Korea.
Taken together, these indications, and various others that have been noted in recent

weeks, appear to reflect a change in tactics
at least, though it should be noted that there

APRIL 1, 1953
have also been incidents which do not seem
to indicate a reduction in tension, and in any
event, a change in tactics does not necessarily
mean a change in policy. As Mr. Pearson
said in the House of Commons on March 23,
we have no concrete evidence that an actual
change in Soviet policy has occurred. This
being true, our own policy should clearly be
one of caution.
Nevertheless, Western leaders have already
indicated that while peaceful overtures from
the Soviet Union may be welcomed
cautiously, they will be welcomed al the
same. At his press conference on March 19,
President Eisenhower made it clear that the
United States Government wished to make it
as easy as possible for the new Soviet leaders
to adopt different policies towards the Western nations. This seems to us to be important.
This would not be an appropriate time to
make Western demands on the Soviet bloc
sound in any way like an ultimatum.
The Western nations have developed effective policies for meeting the threat of Soviet
expansionism and for dealing with Soviet
intransigeance. It would clearly be the
height of folly to abandon these policies on
the basis of a few tentative peace-feelers. So
long, however, as we do not relax our vigilance, we have nothing to lose and everything to gain in any moves which may lead to
a reduction in the tension which has existed
in the world since the last war.

Community; but which would later be able
to assume other functions to be decided upon
by the participating nations. There are also
plans under continued discussion for integration in health, agriculture and transport, and
most recently, the Netherlands Government
has made proposals for the eventual creation
of a customs union in connection with the
proposed European Political Community. It
is too early as yet to know what will eventually be decided with respect to these various
plans and proposals, but there is a general
recognition, which has been repeatedly
expressed in the Council of Europe, and elsewhere, that the closest possible links must
be maintained between those countries of
Europe which are participating in one or
more of the various plans for integration,
and those which are not. The United Kingdom and a number of other countries have
established delegations to the High Authority
of the Coal and Steel Community, and
measures of cooperation with non-member
countries have been agreed on both by the
Coal and Steel Community, and by the
drafters of the proposed constitution for a
Political Community. The Council of Europe
will have a large part to play in giving effect
to these measures of co-operation.
However the future of the European Political Community, and possibly of some of the
other plans for integration, depends to a
large extent on the fate of plans for integration in defense, for the European Defence

SENATE

An important step forward was taken on
March 19 when the Lower House of the
German Federal Parliament passed by u
vote of 224 to 165 the bill concerning the
ratification of the E.D.C. Treaty. The bill
now goes to the Upper House where Chancellor Adenauer does not command a majority, so that there is some doubt as to the outcome. A further hurdle in the path of final
German ratification is the determination of
the Social Democratic Party (S.P.D.), the main
opposition party, to challenge the constitutionality of the E.D.C. Tireaty before the
Federal Constitutional Court, the highest
legal body in Western Germany.
The position in the other countries which
signed the Treaty varies a good deal but
early ratification by any of them does not
appear likely and there is a tendency to
await action by France. Understandably,
French public and parliamentary opinion is
divided on the issue. Problems such as the
status of the Saar, French overseas commitments and the reluctance of the United
Kingdom to become a full partner in the
E.D.C., have led the French Government to
seek additional guarantees before ratification.
They are therefore negotiating with the
United Kingdom Government on the question
of more direct association of United Kingdom forces with the E.D.C. forces. They are
also asking their E.D.C. partners to accept
additional protocols to the Treaty. These
protocols would permit France to withdraw
forces from the European Army for use overseas more or less at will, maintain armament
works to equip her overseas troops outside
the provisions of the E.D.C. Treaty, and place
French officers and men in the European
Army on the same footing as those serving
in her overseas forces, all this without affecting France's voting strength in the E.D.C.
Council of Ministers.
The Treaty has nevertheless been introduced into the National Assembly and is
being subjected to close scrutiny by two committees of that body. Without going into
further details, I think I may say that it will
be some months before the French Government is in a position to ask the National
Assembly for a final vote on ratification.
Honourable Senators will have seen that M.
Bidault, the French Foreign Minister, has
recently suggested that it might even be
necessary to place the whole issue before the
French people by means of a referendum.
NATO
I should now like to turn to the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization which has done
much to strengthen the forces of the free
world. Total defence expenditures of NATO
countries have more than tripled since the

The
Treaty was signed four years ago.
European members of NATO have increased
tLhelr frces from approximntely 2,450.000 in

1949 to nearly 3,300,000 today. By the end
of 1952, the goal of fifty divisions in Europe,
half active and half in reserve, had been substantially achieved. By the end of 1953
there will be approximately 4,000 aircraft
available, more than double the number
available two years ago. Firm goals for land
forces for the end of 1953 have not yet been
agreed. These figures are sound evidence
that NATO is producing the results hoped
for when the Treaty was signed.
It might be of interest if I were to describe
briefly the functions of the North Atlantic
Council and its subordinate civilian and
military bodies. In the Council resides the
authority vested in the Organization by its
member governments. Originally, it was convened only periodically and was attended
by the Foreign, Defence and Finance
Ministers of the NATO countries. It soon
became clear that Ministers could not provide the time necessary to transact NATO
business on the continuing basis required.
Eventually it was decided to organize the
Council in such a way that it could function
in the absence of the Ministers. This was
done by appointing to it Permanent Representatives of member countries who would
meet in permanent session in Paris. Each
Permanent Representative is responsible to
his own government and the Council, whether
attended by Permanent Representatives or
Ministers, is in no sense a sovereign body.
All decisions must be unanimously agreed,
though it is possible to agree with reservations and to put different views on record.
The chairmanship of the Council rotates
annually among foreign ministers, according
to the alphabetical order of the member
countries. The Vice-Chairman of the Council
is Lord Ismay, who is also Secretary-General
of the Organization, and he normally presides
over meetings of the Permanent Representatives.
Directly responsible to the SecretaryGeneral, and through him to the council, is
the International Secretariat, consisting of
146 officers from twelve different nations. It
functions as the NATO Civil Service. It
assists the Council and its subsidiary
committees in their deliberations by collecting and analyzing information on the subjects
discussed. It follows up their decisions and
sometimes also initiates discussions.
Responsible to the Council are a series of
committees, both civil and military. The
most senior on the military side is the Military Committee, consisting of Chiefs of Staff
of member countries, which meets periodic-

APRIL 1, 1953

ally to give guidance to the Council on military matters. Its day to day responsibilities
are undertaken by the Military Representatives Committee, which consists of representatives of the Chiefs of Staff of NATO
countries, and which meets regularly in
Washington. The executive arm of both these
committees is the Standing Group, consisting
of the Chiefs of Staff of the United Kingdom,
France and the United States, or their
deputies, which also has its headquarters in
Washington. It has a Liaison Office in Paris
to ensure close co-operation with the Council.
The NATO military commanders are directly
responsible to the Standing Group. There are
two Supreme Commanders, as you know;
General Ridgway is Supreme Allied Commander Europe, with his headquarters
(SHAPE) near Paris; and Admiral McCormick
is Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic with
his headquarters at Norfolk, Virginia.
Because military planning for the integrated forces of fourteen countries involves
such complex and far-reaching considerations, it is now undertaken as part of an
Annual Review by the Council of member
countries' defence plans which embraces the
whole picture of forces, production, defence
expenditure and economic conditions in every
NATO country. This review begins, with
reports by the NATO Supreme Commanders
on the status of the forces under their command. Assumptions are then made about
relevant external factors, including the
strength and intentions of the Soviet Union
and on this basis an estimate of the risk is
drawn up by the NATO military authorities.
This estimate is taken into consideration
when the Supreme Commanders draft recommendations about further strengthening of
their forces. At the same time, on the civilian
side a picture is obtained from the review
of the economic and political positions of
NATO countries. It is then the task of the
Council to weigh the military recommendations against the capabilities of countries in
deciding how many forces, and what types
and quality of forces, should be put at the
disposal of NATO in future years.
The Canadian contribution to General
Ridgway's forces as of December 31, 1952,
was one infantry brigade group and two air
force wings of three squadrons each. By the
Spring of 1954 it is planned to have an air
division of four wings assigned to SHAPE
in Europe.
I know that many of you are interested
in the progress that is being made in the
implementations of Article 2 of the North
Atlantic Treaty. Article 2 reads as follows:
"The Parties will contribute toward the
further development of peaceful and friendly

international relations by strengthening their
free institutions, by bringing about a better
understanding of the principles upon which
these institutions are founded, and by promoting conditions of stability and well-being.
They will seek to eliminate conflict in their
international economic policies and will
encourage economic collaboration between
any or all of them."
Although NATO has had to give priority
to its military activities because of the
urgent need for organizing military defence,
a good deal of attention has been given
to non-military matters. The North Atlantic
Council from time to time has had useful
discussions on problems of foreign policy of
concern to all members. There have been
exchanges of views on information policy,
that is, on the policy to be followed by NATO
itself, and by member governments, in making
better known the objectives of NATO and in
developing the concept of the Atlantic community.
The Council has set up a Committee on
Labour Mobility which, while avoiding a
duplication of the activities of existing international organizations, is investigating both
the domestic and international aspects of
the problem of labour mobility.
A Committee on Social and Cultural Cooperation has been established under the
chairmanship of the Canadian Permanent
Delegate to the North Atlantic Council, Mr.
Heeney. This Committee is working on
various projects for co-operation in the social
and cultural fields.
It is important to remember that the members of NATO are also members of other
international organizations in which they
co-operate with one another and with other
countries in many kinds of activities. There
are, therefore, definite limits to the social,
economic and cultural co-operation that can
be developed within NATO without impinging
on the useful work of other international
organizations.
As time goes on, however, it is hoped to
broaden the non-military activities of, NATO,
so as to make of the organization a positive
expression of the North Atlantic community
as well as a defensive alliance.
United Nations
Any review of international events must
take account of developments in the United
Nations, for while the original high hopes of
its founders have not been realized it remains
an organization of great importance. It may
not, because of deliberate Soviet obstruction
be able to do the things we would like it to
do but we must not under-estimate either its
present usefulness or its future possibilities.

SENATE
The Seventh Session of the General Assembly
of the United Nations which began last
October has not yet come to an end and it
would therefore be premature to attempt an
assessment of what it has accomplished.
Before entering into detail, I may say that
in general this Session appears to have been
important and fruitful, that it has dealt in
a moderate and constructive spirit with
several potentially explosive issues and has
given grounds for hope that, at least for those
who sincerely wish to make it work, the
United Nations is still the best means we
have available for the achievement of a
world at peace, united in its striving towards
material progress and spiritual development.
The honour conferred upon the Secretary of
State for External Affairs in his election to
the office of President of the Assembly has
both emphasized and enhanced the role which
the Canadian Delegation has been able to
play at the current Session.
Korea is of course the most important
matter that has been discussed. Before
Christmas, the political aspects of the problem
received consideration and during a debate
lasting almost six weeks the Assembly
endeavoured to find a solution to the impasse
in the armistice negotiations arising from the
unwillingness of many North Korean and
Chinese prisoners-of-war to accept repatriation. This was the principal issue preventing the completion of an armistice agreement, since both the Communist Chinese and
North Korean Governments insisted upon
repatriation of all prisoners without exception. The resolution proposed by India and
adopted on December 3 by an overwhelming
majority of 54 favourable votes to the five
of the Soviet bloc and one abstention would
have provided that 90 days after the signing
of an armistice the disposition of such prisoners would be referred to the political conference to be called under Article 60 of the
draft agreement drawn up at Panmunjom,
and that within a further 30 days, the
responsibility for the care and maintenance
and subsequent disposition of any remaining
prisoners would be transferred to the United
Nations, which "in all matters relating to
them, shall act strictly in accordance with
international law". As the members of the
Committee are aware, both the Communist
Chinese and North Korean Governments
rejected this offer, but in the last two days
there have been developments favourable to
the conclusion of an armistice.
At the resumed Session, some further debate
of the political issues relating to Korea served
a useful purpose in that it again underlined
the complete isolation of the Soviet bloc and
gave a number of delegations, including the

Indian, the opportunity to reaffirm their support of the stand taken in December. In
addition, the Assembly has adophe

Of the other principal political issues
before the assembly, four were dealt with
before Christmas: the Tunisian and Moroccan
questions, the question of race conflict in
South Africa resulting from the policies of
apartheidof the Government of the Union of
South Africa, and the Palestine item.
There are racial and colonial conflicts
implicit in all these subjects and with the
exception of the Palestine issue they all raise
the difficult problem of reconciling the
domestic jurisdiction of sovereign states with
the legitimate interest of the United Nations
in human rights and fundamental freedoms.
The Governments of France and the Union of
South Africa, who might be termed the
defendants in these questions, adopted diametrically-opposed policies at the Assembly;
France refused to participate in the discussion
of the Tunisian and Moroccan questions,
while South Africa argued its case ably and
at length. It is a hopeful sign that the resolutions adopted on the first three questions were
on the whole fairly moderate and constructive. Those on Tunisia and Morocco, which
the Canadian Delegation supported, referred
to the United Nations "as a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations to the attainment
of their common ends under the Charter",
expressed the hope that the parties would
continue their negotiations, and appealed to
them to conduct their relations in an atmosphere of goodwill and settle their differences
in accordance with the spirit of the Charter.
A very encouraging development in this
debate was that the compromise resolutions
which eventually proved acceptable to the
Assembly were proposed by a group of Latin
American states, which suggests that this
group of underdeveloped countries may in
future be able to play a moderator's part in
the colonial and racial issues which are
likely to arise at later sessions. The resolution on race conflict in South Africa had two
parts. The second, which Canada supported,
solemnly called upon all member states to
bring their policies into conformity with their
obligation under the Charter to promote the
observance of human rights and freedoms.
The first part, which we did not support, set
up a commission to study the problem and

APRIL 1, 1953

report thereon to the eighth session of the
General Assembly. There has been no sign
that the Government of South Africa will
co-operate with the commission and the
eventual outcome of the resolution must
therefore remain uncertain.
The Palestine problem was placed on the
Assembly agenda on the initiative of the Arab
states, which were chiefly concerned to have
a boundary settlement with Israel on the
basis of the 1947 recommendations of the
General Assembly, since these are more
favourable from their point of view than the
territorial clauses of the 1949 armistic agreement. It was hoped for some time, and the
Canadian Delegation worked intensively to
this end, that a resolution could be adopted
which would have urged the parties to undertake direct negotiations for a peace settlement, and which instructed the Palestine
Conciliation Commission to help if requested.
As matters turned out, however, the resolution recommended by the committee was
subjected to amendments in Plenary Session
which failed to gain a two-thirds majority,
and consequently no resolution was adopted.
Though this was perhaps a somewhat disappointing outcome, it may be that the full
and free debate at the session, by giving the
Arab states a chance to air their grievances,
will actually facilitate the opening of direct
negotiations at a later date.
In the economic and social field, the
Seventh Session of the Assembly did not
strike out on any new paths, but was chiefly
engaged in reviewing the work of its various
ancillary organizations.
As at previous
sessions a good deal of time was devoted to
discussions falling under the general heading
of the economic development of underdeveloped countries.
In particular, the
expanded 1953 program of $25 million for
technical assistance proposed by the Economic
and Social Council received final approval.
The Canadian Government, subject to Parliamentary approval, has offered a minimum of
$750,000 for technical assistance provided the
total amount pledged reaches $20 million and
a maximum of $850,000 if the objective of
$25 million is reached. At the present time
about $22 million have been pledged. On the
social and humanitarian side the most.
important intervention by Canada was made
in the closing days of the pre-Christmas
Session when the Acting Head of the Canadian Delegation, Mr. Paul Martin, drew the
attention of the Social Committee, in a
vigorous statement, to the breach of human
rights and fundamental freedoms represented
by religious persecution in Eastern Europe-

at that time exemplified by the four death
sentences passed in Bulgaria on a group of
Catholic priests.
To sum up, I may say that the achievements
of the Seventh Session of the General
Assembly and the tone of debate have so far
been fairly encouraging. The Soviet bloc,
though it has continued its policy of obstruction and has used the General Assembly as
a forum
for its routine
propaganda
manoeuvres, has not yet at least reached the
heights of abuse and invective displayed at
some previous sessions. Moreover, the voting
on many issues has on the whole tended to
emphasize the isolation of the Communist
group of states and has seemed to show a
flexibility on the part of other groupings,
particularly in the discussion of the Tunisian
and Moroccan questions when, as I have mentioned, a group of Latin American states
produced the compromise resolutions which
commanded a majority of the Assembly votes.
International Trade and Payments
I should like now to turn, in concluding my
survey, to some of the more significant recent
developments in the field of International
Trade and Payments. Since the signing of
the Bretton Woods Agreements at the end
of the war most of the countries of the free
world have been formally committed to the
objective of multilateral trade and payments
in an expanding world economy. But this
objective has not moved appreciably closer
with the passage of the post-war years-years
which have been marked by restrictions on
trade and payments, by inflation, by the
emergence of discriminatory economic blocs,
and by recurrent economic crises. In many
parts of the world, trade discrimination has
become the rule rather than the exception;
measures of restriction which were to have
been transitional have become permanent
impediments to the natural flow of trade. The
need to eliminate conflicts in economic policies
was recognized in Article II of the North
Atlantic Treaty and it is perhaps not too
much to say that the full strength and wellbeing of the free world will not be realized
until a more harmonious economic relationship can be established between all the main
trading countries, NATO and non NATO
alike. As a great trading nation, we in
Canada must, I think, continue to press for
a solution to international economic problems
on the widest possible basis.
The question arises whether the time has
not come to reaffirm our basic objectives and
to take some more positive and constructive
steps towards their achievement. I think the
international climate is ripening for such
action. There is undoubtedly an increasingly
widespread appreciation of the need to break

SENATE
down undesirable bairriers to trade and there
is growing awareness of the relationship
between sound internal policies and countries'
balance of payments. Moreover, countries
are realizing that the maintenance of quota
and other restrictions on trade and payments
not only tends to mask fundamental weaknesses but also helps to perpetuate the very
conditions which make reliance on such
devices necessary.
I am pleased to report that an important
initiative looking towards freeing the exchange
of goods and services has already been taken.
I refer to the proposals developed in the
recent Conference of Commonwealth Prime
Ministers. At this meeting it was decided
to seek the co-operation of the United States
and the main European countries in a plan
to create the conditions for expanding world
production and trade. The stated aim was
"to secure international agreement on the
adoption of policies by creditor and debtor
countries which will restore balance in the
world economy on the lines of 'trade not
aid' and will, by progressive stages and
within reasonable time, create an effective
multilateral trade and payments system
covering the widest possible area". An integral part of the approach considered at London
would be the gradual removal of import
restrictions and the restoration of the convertibility of sterling. It was specific.ally
stated in the Communique that there was
no intention of seeking the creation of a
discriminatory Commonwealth Economic bloc.
You will be aware from the recent visit
of Mr. Eden and the Chancellor of the
Exchequer to Washington that the United
Kingdom has already brought the proposals
developed at the Prime Ministers Conference
to the attention of the new United States
Administration. The conversations in Washington were exploratory and informal and,
as was expected, no commitments were made.
There was, however, a very considerable
measure of agreement on the objectives to be
pursued. It was agreed that the solution of
the economic problems of the free world was
vital to its security and well-being and that
the essential elements of a workable and productive international economic system would
include the freeing of trade and currencies
and the pursuit of sound internal policies.
It was specifically stated in the Joint Communique that one of the objectives should
be to bring about a relaxation of trade restrictions and discrimination in a way which, in
the words of President Eisenhower's State
of the Union Message, would "recognize the
importance of profitable and equitable world
trade".
The Government of the United States welcomed the initiative taken by the United

Kingdom in bringing forward its proposals
and has undertaken to give intensive study
to the
gguL
suting from the Commonwealth Economic Conference, and to
possible alternative approaches, in order to
arrive at a sound judgment with respect to
specific courses of action which might be
taken. All this will, of course, take some
time.
The co-operation of the European
countries will now have to be sought and
there will certainly be further discussions with
Commonwealth countries and with the United
States and various international organizations,
before concrete steps are taken.
As I have indicated, throughout the discussions at the Commonwealth Economic Conference and during Mr. Eden's and Mr.
Butler's talks in Washington, it was always
contemplated that the countries of Western
Europe would be associated with any moves
towards freeing international payments and
the progressive removal of restrictions on
international trade. If further measures for
the liberalization of trade and payments can
be concerted with the countries of Western
Europe the more effective are these measures
likely to prove. The co-operation of the
European countries is necessary and I am
hopeful that now the proposals have been
explained to them it will be forthcoming.
You will have noticed that Mr. Eden and
Mr. Butler attended one of the regular private
meetings of the Council of the Organization
for European Economic Co-operation on March
23 and 24. At this meeting consideration was
given to a number of questions concerning
the future of intra-European trade and payments, and Mr. Butler took the occasion to
explain the general line of the approach to
world economic problems which was considered at the Commonwealth Conference and
to suggest how European countries might be
associated. This is a first step in the process
of consultation with the OEEC countries. At
the present time these countries are discussing
arrangements for the extension of the European Payments Union for another year after
June 30, and it is encouraging that attention
is being given to possible modifications in the
workings of the Union so that it can contribute more effectively towards the freeing of
payments and a return to world-wide multilateral trade.
Partly as a result of these various international discussions, partly because of the
greater realization of the real nature of our
economic problems, and partly because of the
improved financial and economic situation of
many of the countries concerned, I am confident that the time is more propitious now
for an advance towards our objectives in the
field of trade and finance than at any other
time since the war. The full co-operation of

APRIL 1, 1953
the United States is, of course essential and
if it were flot forthcoming ail countries would
wish to re-examine the position. My own
view is that we must move forward. I do not
think we can safely contemplate an indefinite
continuation of the present situation in which
the unity of purpose of most of the countries
of the free world is flot balanced by sound
relations on the economic side. In moving

away from the present system of restrictions
and discrimination there will be difficuit
adjustments to be made; many new problems
will have to be faced and the process will
take tine. But there is at least the hope that
in the end we could emerge from the shadow
of economie crises and dislocation which has
hung over world economic relations during
the post war years.

The Han. the Speaker: Honourable senators, a message has been received from the
House of Commons to return Bill D-5, an
Act to incorporate Mid-Continent Pipelines

have passed this bill wîth certain amendments to which they desire the concurrence
of the Senate.
The amendments were read by the Clerlc

I do not act on that committee, I promised
the Chairman, the honourable senator from
Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), that I would
help out in his absence. One case which. has
been referred back from the Senate to the
committee will be heard by the Deputy Chairman, the distin*guished senator from Calgary (Hon. Mr. Ross), and the two honourable
members who sat with him when the case
was first heard. In addition there are three
unopposed cases which, together with the
case to which I have just referred, can be
heard in the morning. Then we propose to
start at 1.30 the hearing of a lengthy case in
which there is strong opposition. We shaîl
continue on the case until the Senate meets,
at 3 o'chock, and perhaps the house may see
fit to adjourn at 4.30 to allow us to resume
hearing that case.
Further I would draw to the attention of
the honourable leader the fact that the Committee on Immigration
and Labour is
scheduled to meet when the house rises
tomorrow afternoon. I am quite sure that
the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) will agree that we should
allow that committee to sit tomorrow to consider the matter that has been referred to it.
I would strongly suggest that the work of
these committees be facilitated as much as
possible, particularly that of the Divorce
Comrnittee.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators, I
am quite willing to fail in line with the suggestion of the honourab1e leader opposite.
True, t-here is considerable hegishation before
us,' but as far as I know there is no urgency
about it. I had in mind asking the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden)
to explain the budget bills tomorrow afternoon. After the bills have been explained,
any honourable senator who wishes to do so
may adjourn the debate on them. In this
way we could facihitate the work of the
committees.

sibility that was his. During his long period
as Secretary-Treasurer of the province of
New Brunswick, and an even longer period
as a member of the legislature, he gave most
careful and conscientious consideration to
all matters that came before him. He never
refused help to anyone in need, and among
those who knew him best his friends were
legion.
In this house he was instrumental in setting up the special committee investigating
the sale and distribution of salacious and
indecent literature. He was elected chairman, and the committee had just about
completed its work after sitting for two
sessions.
He served his time and country well. We
extend to his children our deepest sympathy
in their bereavement, through which they
have lost a kindly parent and his country a
distinguished son.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
the honourable leader of the government has
well expressed the feelings of this bouse on
the passing of Senator Doone. I will not
refer to his public career in his native province of New Brunswick, beyond saying that I
have always understood it was very distinguished and that he was a very painstaking
member of the provincial governxment. I had
only known him since he entered this house
in the fall of 1949. I liked his personality. I
think he felt that through his efforts in this
chamber he could contribute something that
would be of benefit to the people of Canada
in the years to come. I fear that the work
and energy he devoted to the chairmanship
of the special committee on salacious literature during the last two years hastened his
death. He must have found the work far
beyond what any of us expected it would be.
He worked diligently for long hours, on a
very, very difficult subject: those of us who
have given any thought to the matter at all
know how difficult it is. When an onerous
task of this kind is undertaken by a man so
extremely conscientious and so determined to
deal fairly with both sides, it is almost certain that if the work is prolonged his health
will be seriously affected.
During his all too brief period as a member
of this chamber, the late Senator Hayes Doone
added something of great value to my life, and
I am sure to the lives of all of us here. To
his children I would wish to say that in the
years to come they will be able to look with
pride upon the achievements of their father
on behalf of not only his native province of
New Brunswick, but of Canada as a whole.
Hon. A. Neil McLean: Honourable senators,
in the passing of Senator Doone this honourable body has lost a very gifted and conscientious member. I probably have been

more closely associated with the Honourable
Hayes Doone, both in business and politics,
than most other members of this chamber.
We were warm friends for over a quarter
of a century. It is now nearly twenty years
since he, although of a retiring nature, was
persuaded to enter the public service, and
once he put his hand to the plow, he never
looked back. On going over his record we
see it is one that probably few indeed may
be able to attain.
He served his native province long and
well, first as a member of the legislature
and then for many years as SecretaryTreasurer in the government, and his record
in handling the provincial finances is one
the people of New Brunswick can be proud of.
His appointment to the Senate, just a few
years ago, was well received by the citizens
of our province, for they well knew he
deserved the honour. His whole record since
he first entered public life was that he gave
everything he had to the service of his fellowmen, regardless of their station in life.
I know that in the county of Charlotte where
he lived everyone was his friend. He was
always ready to do his utmost to aid the
unfortunate, or those who might be in need
of something, no matter what the sacrifice
meant to himself. In fact, I had felt at times
that he was really trying to do too much, for
his health had not been the best for some
time past.
Although Senator Doone was a highly
gifted man in many ways, his friends, whom
he could count by the thousands, knew him
as a most kindly and humble gentleman upon
whom they knew they could depend.
I attended his funeral at Black's Harbour
last Thursday. It was one of the largest I
have ever seen in the county. Citizens from
all over the countryside, young and old, and
from all walks of life, were there to do honour
to a man they loved. They all realized New
Brunswick had lost a fine and noble native
son, and Canada a truly great Canadian whose
place will be most difficult to fill.
I wish to express to his family my deepest
sympathy and regrets at his untimely passing.
Hon. G. P. Burchill: Honourable senators, I
join with the previous speakers in paying
tribute to a colleague whose friendship I
have enjoyed since our college days in
Fredericton. Senator Doone, as has been said,
served the state well: first, overseas in the
Great War of 1914-18; and later while the
representative of the county of Charlotte in
the legislature, be was provincial SecretaryTreasurer in the cabinets of the Honourable
A. A. Dysart and the Honourable J. B. McNair.

which sweep down to the sea. Upon being
asked by the delegation to express their
thanks, the late Senator Doone gave an impressive address. We who have since heard
him speak in this house know of the energy
and application, the spirit and inspiration,
which went into any address he made.
Taine, in his History of English Literature,
speaks of the exalted thought of Shakespeare,
and points out that the remarkable thing about
him was that after writing his great works
he was able to retire as a country squire.
I mention Taine's observation to illustrate the
effort required for the production of exalted
literature.

me, whatever it may be for others, the
Victorian era appeals as a time in which life
could be lived quietly and without mnuli
disturbance. In those days the ordinary
citizen was but little affected by events
which happened abroad. Indeed, until the
beginning of the last war the public as a
whole were not very directly concerned. It
is true that the First Great War directly
affected those of us whose relatives-perhaps sons or brothers-served overseas, and
our incomes were reduced because of the
heavy military expenditures, but the emergency was not, so to speak, brought home
to our doorstep. Since then, conditions have
changed. Today the newspapers of the
Prairie provinces and British Columbia are
advocating the construction of military roads
to permit quick dispatch of our forces to
parts of the country which may be
threatened, or even attacked, at a moment's
notice. Maybe the danger is over-stressed;
I am saying nothing about that; but the fact
remains that, so long as the existing world
turmoil continues and the causes of it are
unsolved, the present emergency will continue. We who are older may feel that we
are now living in abnormal times, but I know
that my children are not worked up like
I am about this "abnormal" world. They do
not think it is abnormal; and I am sure that
my grandchildren-and I have quite a few of
them-will look upon these as normal times.
This legislation would tend to suggest, however, that we are not living in a normal
world.
I am not fearful that the Canadian government will do something detrimental under
this act, but I would remind honourable
senators that we have a responsibility. The
Senate is really the bulwark of our constitution and provides the greatest guarantee
for protection under the constitution. How
can an elected representative of the people
get up in his own constituency and say what
he really thinks ought to be done over the
next fifty years? If he does he may not find
himself re-elected, but members of the
Senate are not faced with that risk. As one
who has had long experience as an elected
representative of the people, I know that in
that capacity I looked upon things differently
from what I do now.
Hon. Mr. Fraser: Shame!
Hon. Mr. Haig: I was just as honest then
as I am now, but as a member of this house
I can take a long view of things and know
that as long as I live I shall be able to
support what I have advocated.
I think that the continuance of this Emergency Powers Act suggests that our democracy

is not capable of meeting the demands that
may be made on it. It is unwise in principle
to placc toc much power in

the hnncl

of any

cabinet, be it Conservative, C.C.F., Social
Credit, Liberal, or anything else. Better legislation results when public questions are discussed by both houses of parliament rather
than left solely to the members of the cabinet.
I admit that all the orders in council that I
have read as having been passed under this
act could have been passed by parliament
with little discussion. One of these orders
was passed on November 19, 1952, and parliament met the very next day. Why was
parliament not called sooner if it was important to pass legislation in such a hurry?
Now, I do believe that the bill before us
is an improvement over its predecessors, in
that it does not provide that the act may be
extended next year simply by the passing of a
joint resolution of both houses of parliament.
The extension is until May 31, 1954.
I have a pretty good memory and I recall
when members of another place vehemently
argued that appeals to the Privy Council
should be abolished. Well, eventually all
appeals to the Privy Council, except in the
matter of cases already in progress, were done
away with.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Then in one case the trial
court in Manitoba and the Court of Appeal
of that province, together with all the judges
of the Supreme Court of Canada-how many
judges are there?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Nine.

Hon. Mr. Haig: -were unanimous in giving
a certain judgment. Then the government,
under the power that had been given to it,
directed an appeal to the Privy Council, and
the decision of our courts was thrown out.
No cabinet should be given that kind of
power. The members of both houses of
parliament, regardless of their politics,
had passed legislation doing away with
appeals to the Privy Council, and the cabinet
had no right to appeal to the Privy Council
a decision that had been reached by our
courts.
Honourable senators, I am not going to
ask for a division on this question, for I am
aware that there are not enough supporters
behind me, but I think we should seriously
consider our responsibilities and realize that
we are the last people in the world who
should place in the hands of any cabinet
in Canada the arbitrary powers given under
this legislation. If a war should break out
at any time the government could then bring
in a "Borden bill" to give it all the powers
it required.

APRIL 14, 1953
I see no reason for asking that this measure
be sent to cammittee, but I would warn
honourable members that in passing the bill
we are, fundanientally,
abrogating oui
powers as legisiators and placing them in the
cabinet. We should niot do this.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, ta
me it is a matter of regret that the government has thought it necessary ta reintraduce
and seek ta have continued, if only for
anather year, the Emergency Powers Act. To
my way of thinking, it is fortunate that the
legisiation is ta be extended for only one
year. 1 quite expect, however, that it may
corne before us next year again.
Honourable senators should consider the
bill most carefully. I cannot see why this
legisiation is necessary now. It is true that
we are at present spending a great deal of
money for defence purposes, but I wauld
remind the house that under the Defence
Production Act the Minister of Defence Production has extraordinarily wide pawers in
everything relating ta what may be essential
for aur defence. Parliament granted those
powers because in the work ahead it may be
necessary for the Minister ta seize materials,
take over plants and sa an. On the other
hand, if unhappily war should break aut
we could immediately invoke the War
Measures Act, which is stili on aur statute
books.
What, then, is the need for giving the government the very broad powers that are contained in this Emergency Powers Act? I
say "'very broad powers," because under this
Act the gavernment has power to do practically anything it wishes ta do, with a few
limitations. It could not, under the act,
deport people fromn Canada; it could not
impose taxation; it could not arrest people,
unless incidentally ta a violation of some
regulation passed under the act. But, if
you take out those and a f ew similar exceptions, its powers are almost unlimited. Under
the Emergency Powers Act the government
could take over ail the bus systems in this
country and regulate them. It could take
over the highways of the nation, if it thought
it were essential ta do so-and the government is the judge of whether or not it should
do so.
The honourable leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) referred ta what is now the
rather famous Nolan barley case, to which
I wauld draw your attention. In the year
1941 the prices of oats and barley were
frozen under the freeze order set up by
the Wartime Prices and Trade Board, and it
fixed ceiling prices above which barley and
oats could not be traded in, in Canada. That
situation continued unýtil 1947. But after

the war the -prices af these feeding grains in
the United States advanced until they were
almost three times hîgher than those in
Canada. The gavernment desired ta raise
the prices here, Sa it issued an order-not
under this Act, but under its predecessor,
the Transitional Measures Act-and seized
ail the oats and barley at midnight on a
certain date in March 1947.
Then they
said, "We shahl give this barley back ta
the owners of it at a much higher price"las I recall, far barley, something like 30
cents a bushel.
Nolan, a Chicago grain
merchant trading in Canadian grain, owned
40,000 bushels of barley in an elevatar at
Fort William, and hie said, "I arn going ta
find out whether or not it is possible in
Canada for the government ta seize a man's
property and dispose of it in this way."
Court actions were commenoed. The Canadian courts, every one of them-from the
Manitoba Court af King's Bench where, in
the flrst instance, the Chief Justic heard the
case, and the Manitoba Court of Appeal, in
which the decisi *on was unanimous, ta the
Supreme Court of Canada, i whose judgment ahl the judges, except two cancurredail the courts decided that the government
should not have taken Nolan's barley. The
government then carried the appeal ta the
Privy Council, and the Privy Council reversed
this judgment. On what basis? On the basis
that the government was the judge of
whether or not these things should be done.
That was the extent of the power that was
placed in the hands of the governxnent by the
Transitional Measures Act. And that is the
extent of the power that we taday give the
gavernment under this legislation..
Now, if there were any great emergencies
pending so that it might be necessary ta give
the gavernmnent this almost unlimited power
ta legislate by decree, it would be a different
matter. Because that is what this is, .power
ta rule by decree. It is true that the laws
made by order in council are tabled after
the event. It is true that if some time afterwards parliament decides in its wisdom ta
revake an order in coundcil, it can da so; but
this legislation in effect, as I see it, gives
the government pawer ta rule over a very
wide field by the simple process of order
in council, or, as it is more cammanly called
in Europe, by decree.
New, should any government have those
powers in peacetime, under the conditions
we have today? I cannot see that it shauld.
After ail, what is parliament for? Is not
parliament elected and called together ta
consider these questions? Is not the very
purpose of parliamen-t that it shall be the
means and the agency through which the

SENATE

freedom and liberty of the people are to be
protected?

It may be stated-and I will say at once
that in a large measure I am in agreementthat you can trust the government. I have
not any fear that this government will rush
out and seek to abuse the power given to it
under this law. But that is not the basis
upon whidh the principle of this legislation
should be judged. We should not freely give
away the powers of parliament simply because
we think that they will be exercised wisely
by a government. This law goes on the
statute books. Let us suppose, by a far
stretch of the imagination, that in the election which it is expected will come this year
a socialist governrment is returned, or even a
communist government. They would have,
under the powers that parliament has granted
to the executive, practically everything
required to set up an authoritarian state.
As I say, I myself do not think the government will seek to abuse these powers. But,
I repeat, that is not the basis upon which we
should grant -these powers to the executive.
For these reasons, honourable senators, I
regret that this legislation has been brought
before us again; and I certainly express the
fervent hope that when its tern expires at
the end of the period for which it is extended,
we shall have heard the last of it.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I think I can put my sentiments in a
very few words. I thoroughly agree with the
general tenor of the remarks of the speaker
who has just sat down, and with the leader
of the opposition, in my dislike of this type
of legislation. There is an old saying that
"Hard cases make bad law". It may also be
said that good governments, when great confidence is placed in them, may bring about
bad precedents. The confidence of the people
in Canada in the administration headed by
the late Right Honourable Mackenzie King
and by his successor, the Right Honourable
Louis St. Laurent, has been so great that no
violent objection has been taken when proposals are made to hand ito the executive the
most extraordinary powers. Thus, good governments may sometimes bring about bad
precedents.
This type of legislation is wrong in principle. It is wrong because it seeks to set aside
the corrective influence of parliament and
debating assemblies where the clash of views
may bring out new facts and spread knowledge throughout the nation.
The measure now before us provides for
Star Chamber legislation which I do not
like. I do not suppose it is liked by anybody
in Canada, and there is no outcry against
its passage only because of the implicit confidence of the people that the government

is not likely to abuse the powers which this
measure would give it.
I join with the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) in the expression
of a fervent hope that government will
realize that this type of legislation does not
meet with the approval of informed Canadians, regardless of party, and that means
should be found of getting along in the future
without such legislation. The men who form
the executive body deserve the confidence
the people have placed in them. They are
men of ability and good will, and they are
democrats everyone. That being so, I hope
they will not find it necessary to tax our good
nature further with this kind of legislation.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators, it
is not my intention to speak at any length
on this bill. I do, however, want to express
my belief that the legislation is wrong in
principle, and I should not like to see this
bill given second reading without my making
a protest against it. I think it is the duty of
the members of the Senate who are opposed
to the measure in principle to speak out
against it.
For my part, I have not yet heard any
argument advanced as to what type of emergency might have to be dealt with under this
legislation. I agree pretty well with the
observation of the leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) that we are now in normal times. In
spite of the fact that there appears to be
an approach towards the establishment of
peace between the Soviets and what are
sometimes called the free nations, we constantly hear expressions from the people to
the south of us-and I am sorry for it-that
they do not believe in the sincerity of the
peace proposals. Regardless of where such
statements are made-whether it be in the
United Nations, in the United States or in
Canada-we must do our part to arrive at a
peaceful settlement of the conflict. Certainly
we have nothing to lose by negotiation, and
we have everything to gain.
I repeat, I have not heard one positive
statement as to what possible emergency
might have to be dealt with under this legislation. It is a common saying that the greater
includes the lesser; and certainly the War
Measures Act includes powers proposed
under this bill. In any event, if an emergency,
such as the outbreak of war, should arise,
parliament would immediately be summoned
and the necessary powers given.
When the leader of the government cited
the various orders in council passed under
this act since 1952 he did not indicate
whether any one of them had to do with a
real emergency. I think it would be worth

APRIL 14, 1953
while to study this question in committee
with a view to establishing whether or not
during the past two years any emergency
has been dealt with under this legislation.
A positive answer to that question might be,
to my way of thinking, a fair reason why
we should continue the legislation.
It is pointed out to us that the bill would
extend the emergency powers for one year
only, and not for two years. To me that is
scarcely an argument in favour of the passage of the bill. The matter could be brought
up again next year merely by a resolution
by the two houses, and it could be debated
at that time.
I believe that the measure before us is
wrong in principle. And if honourable senators share that view, I think it is their duty
to say so.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
as I said in my earlier remarks, I am not in
a position to indicate the particular nature
of all the orders in council to which I
referred. However, the two new orders
passed in 1952 had to do with security regulations on the Great Lakes.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Were they regarded as
dealing with an emergency?
Hon Mr. Robertson: In that particular case
I think they were.
I should like to attempt to answer the
specific question as to what emergencies may
arise to be dealt with under this legislation.
That, it seems to me, is the "$64 question", and
no one can anticipate its answer. While, as
has been pointed out, there is reasonable
prospect that certain of our difficulties will be
resolved, I think it is hardly fair to suggest
that when men are giving their lives for a
cause in a far-off country conditions are
normal. I do not think that that is a reasonable suggestion. Casualties may be light, but
that does not change the fact that we are at
war. At present the war is confined to a
relatively limited area. But those charged
with the major responsibility in this connection, who have the advantage of a wide
knowledge of the existing situation, have
asked the governments and parliaments of
our own country, of the United States and of
Great Britain to authorize extraordinary
expenditures for defence. I believe my honourable friend pointed out last year that the
then current costs of the defence budget had
only been exceeded in one or two previous
years during actual hostilities. The war
picture has, of course, changed since, and
there are good reasons for what is being
done, but I am unable to admit that there
is anything normal about it, or anything comparable with what we have known hitherto.

The second argument we have heard is that,
because parliament is in session, neither an
Emergency Powers Act nor a War Measures
Act, nor anything of the kind, is necessary. I
ask my honourable friend why, if that is so,
it was necessary to have a War Measures Act
during the last war. Parliament could have
been called to discuss whatever needed
attention.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Parliament was not sitting
constantly.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: True, but parliament
is not sitting constantly now.
Hon. Mr. Euler: There is no great war now.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I will concede that, in
respect of magnitude, it cannot be called a
great war, but I suggest that what we are
going through now is far from a condition of
peace. If your boys are being killed, is that
peace? Of course not.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I suggest that it is
termed not a war, but a police action.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: If my honourable
friend wants to call it a police action he has
a perfect right to do so, but as far as I know
that is not the term applied to it by the
government.
But to come back to the point. Under the
conditions which existed during the war the
government of which my honourable friend
was a member saw fit, although parliament
could have been assembled at any time, to
press for powers far in excess of those which
are asked for now.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I interrupt my
honourable friend to say that, in a war such
as we were engaged in from 1939 to 1945, a
multitude of things had to be dealt with
immediately, and parliament could not be
assembled for several weeks. But that condition does not exist today.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: My honourable friend
is quite right in saying that it does not exist
today, but neither he nor anybody else is in
a position to say that it could not arise over
night.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: My honourable friend
says "no", but as to that, he knows no more
than I do, and he is in no better position to
read the minds of the occupants of the
Kremlin than I am.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Would not the leader's
argument hold equally good in peacetime?
One could not tell what might happen the
next day.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I admit that. But if
the existence of such legislation as this should

SENATE
be the means of saving one life, to enact it
would be, I ihink, th±e part of wisdom. T am
sure my honourable friend will not attempt
to argue that the conditions we face at this
time correspond to those which existed before
the first war, although I will not deny that
they, also, held possibilities of danger. But
today we are at war, whether we like to call
it such or prefer, as my honourable friend
seems to do, to speak of it as a police action.
It is a cold war for us, but it is a hot war for
the boys who are fighting it: make no mistake
about that. And that there are no more men
being killed than there are, does not change
the principle at all. The simple truth is, as
the Prime Minister has said time and time
again, that we cannot tell what emergency
may arise. It is this consideration, I assume,
that prompted parliament to support through
thick and thin, during the war, the War
Measures Act. Today, relatively speaking,
and perhaps because we think in terms of
Korea, which is a long distance away, the
danger may not be as great as it was in the
two great wars. On the other hand, it is
very generally believed that if this continent
should be attacked, that attack will come with
a suddenness unmatched in any other war.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: If my honourable friend
will permit meHon. Mr. Robertson: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: If his assumption should
prove correct, and there was a sudden outbreak of war, the government could within
twenty-four hours bring in the War Measures
Act.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: If that be true, my
honourable friend would be living under
exactly the same kind of legislation as we
find in this bill. My honourable friend says
that there is on the statute books an authority
which, without referring to parliament, the
government can invoke if an emergency
should arise. Is that so?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Then I repeat that
what, in an emergency, the government could
do under the War Measures Act, is precisely
what can be done if parliament approves this
bill.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Then why do we need this?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Because, upon legal
interpretations of the effect of the War
Measures Act, the government thought it was
desirable to be assured of the possession of
certain powers which they felt would be
necessary in an emergency, and that there
were other powers which they did not need,
which they would not seek, and which could
be dropped.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Is not this the distinction. that the War Measures Act applies to
war, while this bill applies to times or peace
prior to war?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I suppose that is true,
and that one might get into a legal argument
as to whether we are in a war or a police
action, but primarily the bill is designed in
the interests of the defence of Canada and
the people of Canada. This, I think, is evidently true as regards the two orders in
council which have to do with the Great
Lakes seamen's security regulations. Under
modern conditions war may come with a suddenness which would necessitate very quick
action by the government, and perhaps, as
my honourable friend bas said, in that event
the much more stringent provisions of the
War Measures Act would be applied. So the
bill may perhaps be more aptly described as
one to promote the security of Canada.
There are many ramifications to the bill,
and if honourable senators see fit to give it
second reading I shall move that it be referred
to the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask the leader a
question? Is there similar legislation in the
United States and the United Kingdom?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I cannot answer that
question, but it is one of those pertinent
questions which could be answered in committee. This is an important matter. I am
convinced that this government would have
been derelict in its duty if, since the outbreak
of hostilities in Korea, it had not secured
powers which it felt might be necessary in an
unforeseen emergency. This house saw fit
to pass similar legislation both last year and
the year before. The honourable leader of
the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) opposed that
legislation in principle, but I do not think
there was much discussion when those bills
went through the Senate. The government
does not feel that the international situation
has changed sufficiently to make this legislation less desirable now. On the contrary, it
is felt wise that parliament should extend
these powers for another twelve months.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
is it your pleasure to adopt the motion for
the second reading of this bill?
Hon. Mr. Haig: On division.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time, on division.
REFERRED

TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.

APRIL 14, 1953
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I
strongly support that motion because, after
all, actions speak louder than words and one
may judge what we may expect of this legislation in the months to come by what has
happened during the months that have gone
by. I should like to know the contents of the
orders in council and why they were passed.
Would it be possible to have copies of the
orders in council supplied 'to us before we
deal with this measure in committee? I
think we should be given an opportunity to
read them.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes. I believe that all
the orders in council have been tabled, except
one passed in 1951. I would point out that
three of the orders in council this year were
revocations of orders passed in 1951, and two
are new.
The motion was agreed to.

against those who otherwise would put in a
low price to freeze them out with a view to
obtaining a financial adjustment once the
contract had been secured. In other words, a
contractor would be required to carry on for
a reasonable period before being eligible for
any financial adjustment.
There are also amendments to provide that
the Postmaster General shall report to the
Treasury Board his reasons for not accepting
the lowest tender, and the approval of the
Treasury Board is required before awarding
a contract involving over $5,000.
Honourable senators, that is a brief outline
of the legislation. It occurred to me that the
activities of the Post Office Department have
such a wide effect all over Canada that this
bill might well be referred to committee, if
the house sees fit to give it second reading.

I am pleased to note that the bill proposes
to offer some assistance by way of giving
better mail contracts.
The mail carriers
who operate heavy routes through the country are carrying mail at the lowest cost
in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: Are they allowed any
commission on the sale of stamps?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I understand no commission
is allowed. That is an extra chore they have
to do.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: For what term are mail
contracts made?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I think it is three years.
Although the holder of a mail contract may
apply for extra remuneration, very little
attention has been paid by the Post Office
Department to the increasing number of mail
boxes on the routes. True, some provision
is made for extra remuneration to the contractor by reason of an increase in the mileage of his mail route.
The most highly paid letter carrier in the
city gets, I think, $2,200 per year; but the

68112-27à

man who is serving as many as 700 rural
families under contract for $2,500 and supplying his own means of transportation is
giving the cheapest service in Canada today.
I am sure honourable senators will agree
with me that serious consideration should
be given to the problems of the rural mail
carrier, with a view to provision of better
service to the people in the country.

is of great public importance-the strike of

great loss to the railways, because the cars
cannot be emptied and returned; all twoway shipping is suspended, and there is a
huge loss to everyone concerned. There is
also the danger that our sales of grain in
certain quarters may be reduced or cancelled.
It seems to me, and probably other senators
have had the same thought, that by now we
should have devised a simpler and more
economical way of adjusting wages than
through strikes. Duelling and other violent
means of settling disagreements have long
disappeared. The labour unions have at the
head of their organizations men who are
highly educated, and some of whom receive
salaries larger than the Prime Minister. I
suggest that they might sit down and keep
on working until an agreement is reached as
to what are fair wages, so that the country
shall not be put to all this loss and inconvenience. It would be well to do what we

SECOND READING

Hon. Salier A. Hayden moved the second
reading of Bill 225, an Act to amend the
Excise Tax Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the present
bill contains a number of clauses to amend
certain sections of the Excise Tax Act. These
amendments are beneficial; in some instances,
substantially so. I think the simplest way
of dealing with them is to take the sections
in the order in which they are printed in
the bill, and explain their effect. I think
I can do this with reasonable dispatch.
Section 1 deals with the definition of net
premiums. It has to do with the provisions
in the Excise Tax Act under which premium
tax is levied on premiums received by
insurance companies; and the definition of

addition of the words "or receivable". The

simple.
is very
explanation
casualty insurance companies, by virtue of
the definition of net premiums, have an

option of doing their accounting for premiums

earned on a cash basis or on an accrual or

revenue basis. But the net premiums of
life insurance companies have always been
defined on a cash basis; that is, the definition
has used the words "premiums received" and
omitted the words "or receivable". In the
United States and in the United Kingdom
life companies may proceed on a cash or
revenue basis.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Who exercises the
option?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The option is exercised
at the discretion of the life insurance companies themselves, but the trend as indicated
in the United States and United Kingdom is
towards an accrual or revenue basis. The
revenues of the country are not affected
whether the accounting for the premium tax
is done on a cash or an accrual basis. It is
true that if a life insurance company moves
from a cash to an accrual basis it may pay a
little more tax in the first year of the transition than if it were still paying on a cash
basis, but substantially the revenues of the
country are not affected. This is simply to
provide the option and put life insurance
companies on the same basis as fire and
casualty companies under the Act.
Section 2 provides for the deductions which
an insurance company may make from
premium tax otherwise payable. The language
of this section, as it has existed for many
years, has been very general and in some

APRIL 15, 1953

instances, although not many, has led to
dispute with insurance companies.
The
departmental practice has been to permit the
companies to deduct from the federal premium
tax payable only the provincial premium taxes
paid. But several provinces make a further
levy on premium income. I know that British
Columbia and Ontario, for instance, impose
a tax for the support of the fire marshal's
office. In one or two instances a company
has asserted that it had the right to deduct
the amount of the fire marshal's levy from
premium tax otherwise payable to the federal
treasury.
However, the practice of the
department throughout the years has been
consistent in asserting that the only thing
deductible is the straight premium tax paid
to the province. The underlined words in
this amended section are for the purpose
of making certain beyond all doubt that the
only deduction from federal premium tax is
any general tax of the same nature paid to
a provincial government.
The second part of section 2, which is
found at the top of page 2, deals with fraternal benefit societies. In the past the premium
income of fraternal benefit societies has not
been subject to premium tax. Some fraternal
benefit societies have grown so large they
want to expand into mutual organizations
while continuing to do all the fraternal benefit society business that they have heretofore
been doing. In such cases the question arises
whether the premium income continuing to
be paid on the earlier fraternal benefit business of the societies should still be exempt
from premium tax. Subsection 7, at the top
of page 2, is being added to section 14 of the
Excise Tax Act for the purpose of making
it clear that even though a fraternal benefit
society does move into a larger field of operation where the premium income would be
subject to federal premium tax, nevertheless,
the amaount of premium income that accrues
from policies that were written while the
organization was a fraternal benefit society
would still continue to be free from any
federal premium tax.
Sections 4 and 5, dealing with penalties for
late filing, have to be read together. Roughly,
under the present law, where a registered
insurance company has filed a late return on
premium income, a penalty is provided not
exceeding $50 per day for every day after
the due date for filing. There is no provision
for a penalty for not paying the tax. Section
4 of the bill provides a penalty of $10 per day
for late filing by registered companies; and
for failure to pay the premium tax due the
penalty is 6 per cent of the amount of tax
from the time it should have been paid.

Section 5 deals with other than registered
companies. It is required under the present
law that brokers who write insurance through
insurance companies which are not companies
registered in Canada, must file a return. Then
there is a provision that the policyholders in
such a company must file a return and pay
a tax based on the amount of premium that
he has paid for the policy. At the present
time the penalty is an amount not exceeding
$50 per day for late filing and payment of
tax. This provision in section 5 has been
brought into line with the one I have just
dealt with in section 4. So that now the
penalty for late filing is $10 per day, and the
penalty for not paying the amount when due
is 6 per cent of the tax that was payable at
the time.
The matter may be made clearer if you
regard section 5 as providing a new section
21, subsection 1, of the Excise Tax Act. That
is the part that deals with the position of the
policyholders in other than registered companies; and subsection 2 on the top of page 3
of the bill relates to brokers who write policies
for companies other than registered companies.
Now we come to the real substance of the
Excise Tax Act. First of ail, section 6 repeals
part of VI and VII of the present Excise Tax
Act. Part VI provides for the stamp tax on
cheques, promissory notes, and so on; and
part VII provides for the stock transfer tax. It
is a trite saying that once taxes are levied
for a particular purpose they are continued
indefinitely, even though the purpose no longer
exists, and we have to go on paying them
year after year. The stamp tax was first
put on in April, 1915, during the First World
War. It was then a flat two cents, and has
varied upwards and downwards since that
time. Although the original purpose for the
tax had been lost sight of, it still applied and
produced revenue for the federal treasury.
The estimated loss of revenue through repeal
of the stamp tax is $12 million per year.
The stock transfer tax was first put into
force in 1920 and has been operative since
that time. People paid it as a sort of nuisance
tax. The estimated loss of revenue through
repeal of this tax will be about $3 million
for the first year.
The stepping out of these taxation fields by
the federal government is a move in the
right direction. It is in line with the discontinuance of the federal tax on gasoline,
gas and electricity rates, amusements and
pari-mutuels. Two more taxes are now being
dropped, and temporarily at least are being
left to the provincial jurisdiction.

SENATE
Section 8 of the bill has to do particularly
with the applirntion of the tax to the manufacturer of candy who sells in bulk. At the
present time the man who buys candy from
the manufacturer in bulk and sells it packaged
pays 15 per cent excise tax; and the manufacturer who packages his own candy pays
the tax on the cost of the candy, plus the
cost of packaging. But the manufacturer
who sells candy in bulk pays only 15 per cent
based on the bulk sale price of the candy.
The government thought that there was an
innate unfairness in that operation. The
effect of section 8 is to put the purchaser of
bulk candy who proposes to package it himself in the class of a manufacturer for the
purposes of the application of the 15 per cent
tax. In that way he would be required to
pay the tax on the same basis as the manufacturer who packages and pays 15 per cent
on the packaged sale price.
Hon. Mr. Euler: How does that affect the
consumer?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: As a matter of sheer
speculation I would say that it would not
affect the consumer at all. However, if
there is competition between the producer
of packaged bulk candy and the manufacturer
of candy who has packaged the candy, price
would govern, but I do not know which would
have the advantage. Although I am not in
the candy business I venture to say that by
the time the effect of the fifteen per cent
reaches the retailers it is so ineffective and
the candy so attractive that a difference of
one or two cents would not matter. At least,
the basis of calculation for the tax would
be the same in each case, and after all that
is what is essential for fair taxation.
Section 9 has to do with refund credits. I
should first point out that at the present time
when an appeal against a levy of sales tax
has been successfully argued before the Tariff
Board, a refund of the tax is then directed.
The law in this respect at present reads:
No refund or deduction shall be made under
section one hundred and five as the result of any
declaration of the Tariff Board under this section
or an order or judgment under section one hundred and sixteen in respect of taxes paid more
than twelve months before the date of the application to the Tariff Board for a declaration under
this section.
The practice has developed that while one
person carries the load before the Tarift
Board, other interested persons will sit on the
sideline to watch the outcome of the application. When a decision has been made in
favour of the taxpayer, the others all come
in and claim their refunds. The government
felt there should be some limit as to the
operation of this section, and that the man
who risked his money to challenge a ruling

of the department should get a better break
than some persons who merely waited around
to catch some of the crumbs that fell from

the table.
Section 9 of the bill would change the
present law in this respect: if I appealed to
the Tariff Board against a levy and succeeded
in my appeal, I would be entitled to get a
refund for a period of twelve months from
the date on which I took an appeal; and anyone sitting on the sidelines, awaiting the outcome of my appeal, and then applying for a
tax refund based on the decision of the Tariff
Board, would be entitled to claim a refund
only in respect of the twelve months from
the date of his application. Obviously, the
longer he delayed his application after the
decision of the board, the smaller the amount
to which he would be entitled. For instance,
if he waited ten months before making his
application, he would, practically speaking,
be entitled to collect a refund for only two
months; on the other hand, the person who
applied to the board would have his refund
dated back, and so would be in a much
better position. The department felt that
there should be some distinction between two
such persons who came to the government for
a refund.
Section 10 of the bill would add to the
present section the words "camera lenses".
Camera lenses are thereby made subject to
excise tax. There has grown up a practice
by which people bought a camera body and
then imported the lenses tax free. Also,
some camera producing companies in Canada
would manufacture the body of the camera
without the lens and sell the lens separately,
thereby avoiding the tax on the lens. In
order to prevent that kind of avoidance of
taxation the words "camera lenses" have been
added to section 5 of schedule I. It will now
be clear that whether a camera is bought with
or without the lens, a tax of fifteen per cent
will be charged on the camera and the lens,
whenever acquired, whether in a unit or as
separate pieces.
Section 11 re-writes a clause which was
intended to cover the same things, that is
phonographs, radio receiving sets, television
sets. In the present law all these are in one
item. By section 11 it is proposed to enact
a new section 6 of schedule 1 of the act,
whereby phonographs and radio receiving sets
are to be comprised in one group, which is
found in paragraph (a), and television receiving sets come under paragraph (b). One
reason for doing this is that there is to be
legislation this year in relation to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation; and the
amendment is also connected with the fact
that, radio licence fees having been done

APRIL 15, 1953
away with, some of the grants which the
government proposed to make to the CBC
will be based on the amount of excise tax
collected in respect to radio receiving sets,
and also television sets; and for statistical
purposes a segregation of the excise tax
received in relation to the two types is
required. It is intended that the grant of the
excise tax collected on radio receiving sets
shall be applied to the radio broadcasting
activities of the corporation, while the excise
tax received in relation to the television sets
is to be used for television development and
operation. I do not mean that a badge is
being attached to the two types of revenue
and the amount of the grant will be measured,
so far as these items are concerned, by the
sum so collected. The C.B.C., of course, will
receive other grants as well. But, speaking
broadly, that is one of the purposes of the
division.
Hon. Mr. Reid: How will radio television
sets purchased in the United States be dealt
with under the act as amended? I understand that the 15 per cent tax applies to all
television sets purchased in this country,
and that the proceeds will go as a grant to
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. How
will this affect the purchase of sets across
the line, where they are cheaper?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: My understandingthough I am speaking entirely from recollection-is that for some little time radio and
television sets purchased by Canadians visiting in the United States have not qualified
for entry into Canada under the $100 exemption which returning travellers enjoy. Therefore, anyone who brings them in is subject
to whatever the customs duties are, to the
sales tax and to the excise tax.
Hon. Mr. Vien: If an appliance is a combination of a broadcasting receiving set and
a television receiving set, does it not follow
from the new draft of section 11 that two
taxes will be levied?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I do not appreciate the
honourable senator's question. Section 6 (a)
deals with "radio broadcasting receiving sets
or any combination of the foregoing and tubes
therefor".
Hon. Mr. Vien: Under the section as I read
it, if the appliance is a radio receiving set
it falls under paragraph (a); if it is a television
receiving set it falls under paragraph (b),
and there is an excise tax of 15 per cent in
each case.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: It is subject to 15 per
cent. But I am trying to visualize a combination radio receiving and television set.
That is the thing which is troubling me at

the moment. If it is a radio receiving set,
that is one thing, and if it is a television set,
that is another.
Hon. Mr. Vien: There are combinations of
the two.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: There may be combinations, but they must be chiefly of one character or the other.
Hon. Mr. Vien: No: we have in Montreal
what is called rediffusion.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Oh, yes, I can deal with
that. I was going to say that one of the
problems we should consider in committee
has to do with when this particular section
comes into force. Under the bill before us,
it is provided that all the sections shall come
into force on February 20. This matter of
rediffusion went to the Tariff Board, and the
board gave a decision favourable to the company and against the views of the administrative officials of the department. That decision
is now under appeal in the Exchequer Court,
so I do not feel that I can discuss it further.
But it is intended to move in committee an
amendment that this section shall come into
force at a date later than February 20, which
is stated in the bill, so that no retroactive
penalty shall apply, by reason of the decision
of the Tariff Board, to any person who may
have brought in this type of equipment without having knowledge, from some pronouncement in the budget itself, that this particular
amendment was to be made.
Hon. Mr. Vien: The amendment before us
cannot be construed otherwise than as meaning that two taxes are to be paid, because
the last words are "does not include any
article coming within paragraph (b);" and
then we have television receiving sets, for
which another tax of 15 per cent is applied.
Therefore, if you have a combination of the
two, you must, in my humble opinion, pay
two taxes.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I have studiously adopted
the policy of attempting to explain what the
department is seeking to do, and I have
also studiously refused to express an opinion
as to whether or not what a department
thinks or intends by a particular measure
before us is actually accomplished.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I am not discussing it; I
am just seeking information.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: And I am pointing out
that, if one reads paragraph (b), it is clear
that that paragraph deals not only with radio
television sets and tubes therefor, but with
"any apparatus or device that enables a person to see, or to see and hear, television programs distributed by any means whatsoever
or television radio broadcasting programs
distributed by any means whatsoever." In

SENATE
my off-hand view, that appears to bring under
categuy (b) the kind of thing the hnourable
senator is talking about.
Coming to section 12, this section deals
with the question of replacement tires on
An
automotive vehicles.
self -propelled
amendment of this section was presented in
1952, as a result of the decision of the Tariff
Board that "self-propelled machines" were
not "automotive vehicles." When we passed
the amendment last year we used only the
word "vehicles" and did not include the
word "machines".
By an oversight the
amendment was so worded that the tax would
apply to the replacement tires and tubes for
self-propelled machines but not to the replacement tires and tubes of trailers and attachments for self-propelled machines.
Section 13(a) will now read:
Tires in whole or in part of rubber for selfpropelled machines or automotive vehicles of all
kinds, including trailers or other wheeled attachments used in connection with any of the said
machines or vehicles . . .

As I say, when the amendment was introduced last year the word "machines" was
omitted. The purpose of the present amendmend is to correct this oversight so that the
law will conform to what was intended when
the amendment was passed last year. It will
be found in paragraph (b) that certain
exemptions extend beyond the exemptions
heretofore provided. Subparagraph (il) provides an exemption from tax when tires are
used exclusively for replacement purposes
on machinery designed for and used only
for farm purposes. Subparagraph (iii) provides an exemption from tax when tires are
designed and catalogued for farm machinery
and used on farm trailers used exclusively
for farm purposes.
Section 13 of the bill provides for a new
schedule III. Some of the most important
items of exemption in this schedule come
under the heading "Foodstuffs". If honourable senators would look at the schedule I
would refer briefly to some of the items
which are added to the list of foodstuffs
exempt from sales tax. On page 9 of the
bill the following words will be found underlined:
Materials to be used exclusively in the manufacture or production of the aforementioned foodstuffs.

This means that not only the foodstuffs
which are enumerated will be exempt, but
also materials to be used exclusively in the
manufacture or production of such foodstuffs.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask my friend a
question? I have the schedule before me, and
under the heading "Foodstuffs" I fail to find

any mention of margarine. Is that an oversight on my part or on the part of the government?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I do not think it is an
oversight on the part of the honourable
gentleman from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler),
for I assume that if he had had anything to
do with the preparation of this list margarine
would be on it.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The apparent innocence
with which the honourable senator asked the
question hardly discloses what his thinking
is in this matter. He believes that margarine
should be exempted from the sales tax, and
I think he has called our attention to this
in an effort to have margarine added to the
schedule. I do not argue the point. It is a
question of policy, and at this time I am
merely explaining the proposed amendments
in the bill. It will be up to honourable
senators to deal with the matter as they
see fit.

At page 10 it will be seen that harness
leather and friction disc sharpeners are
further items added to the list of exemptions
under schedule III, and on page 11 nylon
has been added under the heading "Marine
and Fisheries". On page 12 there is set out
a long list of books, college and school
annuals, and so on, which have been added
to the list of exemptions from the sales tax.
Under the heading "Processing Materials"
the schedule has heretofore read:
Materials (not including lubricating oils) consumed in the process of manufacture or production of goods.

This is amended by adding the words "or
expended directly". This part of the schedule
will now read:
Materials (not including lubricating oils) consumed or expended directly in the process of manufacture or production of goods.

The addition of these words "or expended
directly" makes a great deal of difference.
For example, filtering agents are used in
some manufacturing processes and may be
expended directly but are not consumed.
Bone char, which is used for sterilization and
purification purposes in the manufacture of
sugar, is expended directly but is not consumed in the process. The bill is amended so
that the sales tax will not be applicable to
those items which are expended directly in
the manufacturing
process. Incidentally,
materials expended directly will benefit from
the exemption whether they are expended on
application to taxable or non-taxable goods.
Some of these items are: soda ash, lime,
chlorine, activated carbon, fuller's earth,

APRIL 15, 1953
bone char, calcium chloride, washing compounds, detergents, solvents, steam paper,
deep paper, paper cloth and so on. I have
enumerated only some of the items, so one
should not get the idea that this is merely
a tiny exemption tucked away somewhere in
schedule III. It represents a substantial
extension of exemption benefit which will
make itself felt in a large way in reducing
costs.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I observe that sawdust is
listed.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: In which list?
Hon. Mr. Euler: The exemption list under
schedule III.

Hon. Mr. Hayden: It may be. Sawdust
serves some practical purposes.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Perhaps it is a food, or perhaps it can be converted into a food?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: There seems to be some
misconception as to schedule III. In addition
to foodstuffs there are a substantial number
of other items listed under this schedule.
Foodstuffs are only some of a great many
items under this schedule.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Yes, I know.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Two tariff items have
been added on page 14. These have not
been underlined, and I think I should call
attention to them. I refer to tariff items 436
and 697. Tariff item 436 reads:
Locomotive and railway passenger, baggage and
freight cars, being the property or under the control of railway companies in the United States
running upon any line or road crossing the
frontier . . .
In the past the sales tax has been collected
on this equipment.
Under an amendment to the Customs Tariff
Act the sales tax will in future be included
with the customs duty in a composite charge
which will be collected under that act. In
effect the sales tax wiil still be collected but
it will lose its identity under the new
arrangement.

Tariff item 697 reads:
Globes, geographical, topographical

and astro-

nomical.
It is proposed to exempt globes, including
school globes, to put them on a par with
maps which have been exempt under tariff
item 696(a).
Revenue loss in a full year from all the
foregoing sales tax changes will be approximately $8 million.

The remaining amendment is section 14,
which provides for a coming-into-force date
of February 20, 1953, for all these items. But
68112-28

as I indicated earlier, I think some amendment will be put forward when this bill gets
to the committee, so as to provide for a
different coming-into-force date for section 11.
Part II is simply a repetition of sections
to which I have referred. This part makes
the necessary amendments to the Revised
Statutes of Canada, which are now so far
advanced in preparation that they cannot now
be amended in any other way.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators, I
wish to say a few words before this bill is
sent to committee. We have all listened with
a great deal of attention and admiration to
the senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden),
who has made a clear and concise explanation of this bill, which is an intricate one
in some respects. While it seems that taxes
are being reduced and some-such as the
stamp tax-are being done away with, I
wonder if consideration has been given to a
kind of hidden tax that has grown up over
the past years and has become a considerable
burden to most companies, both small and
great. My attention has been drawn by a
company in my own district to a form that
is issued under the Excise Tax Act, or at least
by the National Revenue Department. I am
told that this form, E-160, is in the nature of
an application, because the company is
required to collect the sales tax from other
companies doing business with it, andbelieve it or not-in order to do this it must
have a permit, for which it must pay a fee

of $2.
The chief complaint from most companies
that I come in contact with is that they have
had to enlarge their staffs to cope with the
increased bookkeeping demanded by the
Department of National Revenue. Every
company and firm now must send form after
form to Ottawa, in triplicate, in connection
with the sales tax and other forms of taxation which have arisen over the past years.
I think this is something that we might well
look into. The companies say that this is a
hidden tax which must later be passed on to
the consumer, and that this fact has not been
recognized, generally when amendments have
been made to the Income Tax Act.
I trust that the committee will deal with
this matter when the departmental officials,
and perhaps the minister, come before it.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Hayden: Honourable senators, I
move that this bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.

SENATE
EXCISE BILL
Hon. S. A. Hayden moved the second reading of Bill 226, an Act to amend the Excise
Act, 1934.
He said: Honourable senators, this brief
bill provides simply for a reduction in the
excise tax on cigarettes. By section 1 of the
bill the tax on cigarettes weighing not more
than two and one-half pounds per thousand is
reduced from $6 to $4 per thousand; and on
cigarettes weighing more than two and onehalf pounds per thousand, the tax is reduced
from $11 to $5 per thousand. The heavier
cigarettes are the so-called "king size".
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
should like to suggest that this bill be
referred to a comnittee, in order that I may
have the opportunity of examining the
officials on one question.
Under the present law part of the tax on
cigarettes is collected from the manufacturer
and part from the distributor. I think the
tax should be collected at the manufacturer's
level only. When the tax was reduced in the
recent budget a number of distributors who
had already paid the tax on cigarettes in their
possession found there was no provision for
getting a refund.
This is what happens: The budget usually
comes down in March, and if there are
rumours, as there were this year, that theré
will be a cut in the cigarette tax, retail distributors decide to curtail their buying. They
do not want on their shelves stock on which
a higher duty has been paid. The manufacturer may either continue to produce and
increase his stock on hand, or he may insist
on passing it on to the distributors on the
chance that there will not be a reduction in
tax. The result has been in some instances
almost a complete shut-down in the manufacturing process, causing considerable unemployment.
I think the tax should apply at the manufacturer's level only, and that it should not
come into effect until a reasonable time after
being announced.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The bill before us provides that the new tax shall come into force
on February 1, 1953.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I see that the bill makes
that provision, but I seriously suggest that
we might see fit in committee to amend the
bill so as to provide for taxation at one level
only. In that way the manufacturer could
hold cigarettes in his warehouse without paying tax, pending the budget provisions. As a

matter of fact, I made that recommendation
to the department, but they did not choose to
adopt it.

Obviously, taxes are

iue

easily

collected at the source, and the collection
costs would be reduced. If such a change
were made the people engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes would not suffer
hardship during a period of transition.
Apart from these observations, I am in
favour of the bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED

TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall the bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Honourable senators, in
view of the remarks made by the honourable
leader opposite, I move that the bill be

The motion was agreed to.
CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. S. A. Hayden moved the second reading of Bill 227, an Act to amend the Customs
Tariff.
He said: Honourable senators, the amendmients proposed by this bill are beneficial in
nature.
Section 1 would remove the additional duty
of $2 per thousand on cigarettes imported
from any country. That is complementary
to the provisions to which I have earlier
referred in the Excise Bill. In subsection 2
honourable senators will note a number of
tariff items which are repealed. The new
tariff items are contained in the schedule at
the end of the bill.
Section 2 proposes to repeal item 1206 of
schedule C to the Customs Tariff Act, and
provides a new item 12,06. Briefly, it authorizes the Governor in Council to suspend by
regulation the existing provision against the
importation of prison-made primary materials
when needed for further manufacture in this
country, but not available in Canada. The
main purpose of this amendment is to permit
the importation of Mexican henequen fibre
for the manufacture of rope and cordage.
Section 3 provides that the proposed amendments shall come into force on February 20,
1953.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators
will recall that yesterday the honourable
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
drew to my attention the fact that the Divorce
Committee would be sitting again this afternoon, after the Senate rises, and asked that
we facilitate their work. The Committee on
Immigration and Labour also is meeting this
afternoon. In these circumstances I suggest
that the remainder of the items on the Order
Paper be not proceeded with today.

In connection with the order of reference of the

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this report be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mrs. Wilson: With leave, I move concurrence in the report.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, unfortunately I was unable to attend the meeting
of the Immigration and Labour Committee
yesterday because I was busy at the Committee on Divorce. I should like to ask the
honourable senator from Rockcliffe (Hon.
Mrs. Wilson) what is the nature of the investigation being made by the Immigration Committee.
Hon. Mrs. Wilson: At yesterday's meeting
the committee heard Mr. Kelly, representing
the National Council of Chinese Communiity
Centres, who alleged that discrimination bas
been shown against the Chinese. The Deputy
Minister of the Department of Immigration
and Labour, Colonel Laval Fortier, discussed
various cases, but the committee did not
come to any decision.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not object to adoption
of the report, for I am in favour of a stenographic report being made of as many of
>ur committees as possible. I would point
aut, however, that at the present time our
reporting staff is exceedingly busy, particularly on divorce hearings. The Divorce Committee is to hear a large number of cases

tomorrow. All these cases have to be reported
and transcribed, and the printed evidence
has to be presented with the committee's
reports to the Senate before further action
can be taken on them. There is no use in
our working in that Committee all day
tomorrow
unless we can get prompt
transcript of the evidence, and it will not be
possible to get it if the reporting staff is going
to be engaged on other committee work.

INCOME TAX BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Salier A. Hayden moved the second
reading of Bill 228, an Act to amend the
Income Tax Act.

He said: Honourable senators, we have
before us a hardy perennial, in the form of
amendments to the Income Tax Act. This
year the amendments, in the main, represent
reductions in various rates from those pro-

vided in the present act.
The bill looks like a very bulky document.
It

contains

45

sections,

covering

some

34

pages. And then there is a duplication of
those sections for the purpose of carrying
the amendments into the new Revised Statutes
which are now in an advanced state of preparation.

As a preliminary I should like to mention
one or two facts which, although they may
already be known to honourable senators, will
I think stand repetition. The first has to do
with personal income tax. In the year 1950-51,
which was five years after the conclusion of
the war, when conditions had become fairly
normal-in so far as any conditions within
the last twelve or thirteen years can be
called normal-persona] income taxes at the
rates then in force, which we might call
pre-Korean rates, produced a revenue of $652
million.
Now in the present budget and this Income
Tax Bill there is a re-establishment of the
personal income tax rates that were in force
in 1950. That could be called getting back
to a pre-Korean basis. And it is estimated
that those rates, applied to today's picture,
will produce from personal income taxes a
revenue of $1,165 million. Those figures give
some idea of the extent to which salaries,
wages and other income have gone up in the
period from 1950 to 1953.
It is estimated that the personal income
tax reductions provided for in the amendments before us will amount in the coming
fiscal year to about $100 million. These

APRIL 16, 1953
applicable to the year 1949-that being the
year in which the present paragraph (g) came
into force-and
subsequent years, the
premiums paid on the acquisition by a company of its preference shares, or any part of
them, never became income as a matter of
fact or law and subject to tax; and therefore,
any person in the interval from 1949 to date
who has shown such premium as part of his
income and paid income tax on it would be
in a position to claim a refund on it. As
regards redemption: the premium paid by a
company on the redemption of its shares is
made income down to April 30, 1953. After
that date, even where a premium is paid on
the redemption of preference shares, it will
not constitute income in the hands of the
shareholder who receives it. There are other
provisions later on for catching up on some
of the revenue which might otherwise be lost.
I will refer to them subsequently. But the
neat effect of section 1 is that the premium
paid on the acquisition of preference shares
by a company never became income, and that
the premium paid on the redemption or the
compulsory taking of preference shares by
a company after April 3,0, 1953, will not constitute income in the hands of the shareholder
who receives it.
Section 2 deals with the matter of expenses.
It will be recalled that in 1946 a provision
was inserted in the Income Tax Act whereby
members of provincial legislatures were
allowed an exemption from income tax for
expenses, but a ceiling was placed on such
expenses: they were to be no more than onehalf of any salary received by virtue of the
office. The further condition was attached
that the money received by the member of
the provincial legislature was to be voted or
assigned or given to him specifically as an
item for expenses. He could not arbitrarily
divide the salary he received and say "So
much of it is income". For example, if he
received $2,000, he was not allowed to treat
half that sum as salary and half as expenses.
There would have to be a specific giving and
allocation as expenses of a certain amount,
which could not exceed one-half of the salary
and expenses.
That provision bas been
extended to include any elected officer of an
incorporated municipality, and it is made
retroactive to 1946. If there are officers of
incorporated municipalities who have received
since 1946 expenses by virtue of statutory
provisions so framed that they can qualify
premiums paid by a corporation on the redemption as a result of ,this amendment, some of them
may find that they are entitled to refunds.
before April 30, 1953 of any of its shares.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Is my friend putting in
By omitting the word "acquisition" and by
making the new paragraph (g) to section 6 any provision to include senators?
reductions, however, do not apply during the
full year. The reductions in corporate income
tax rates, which do apply for the full year,
will amount to about $97 million. Reductions
provided for in various other ways will
amount to about $40 million.
I cite those figures, honourable senators, to
indicate that one way in which we can effect
a downward trend in income tax is, by
increasing the volume of operations and
earnings. As I have already shown, the
increase in personal earnings since 1950 bas
been so great that although the personal
income tax rates this year are the same as
in 1950 they will yield almost double as much
as they did then. It may well be that only
by increased earnings shall we be able to
effect a reduction in tax in future.
Like all taxpayers, present and future, I am
very strongly in favour of income taxes being
as small as possible. However, it must be
recognized that we have a country to run,
obligations to meet, and a position in world
affairs to maintain. If we are to continue to
be proud of our Canadian way of life and of
our international position we must be prepared
to provide the revenue necessary for their
maintenance.
Having made those general observations,
I now come to the consideration of the
amendments before us. I propose to deal
with them, as I did last year, in the order
in which they appear in the bill.
Section 1 has to do with premiums on the
redemption or acquisition of preference shares
by a corporation. Redemption, of course,
means the compulsory calling in or redeeming of shares by a company; acquisition is the
going into the market by a company and the
buying of redeemable preference shares from
their holders; and premiums are the amounts
paid in excess of the par value of the shares
in order to acquire or redeem them. Heretofore premiums have been regarded by the
income tax department as income in the
hands of the shareholder, and he has been
obliged to pay income tax on them.
By reference to the opposite side of the
first page it will be seen that section 6 of the
present act deals with a long list of items
which are to be regarded as income, one being
amounts received by the taxpayer in the year
as premiums paid by a corporation on the
redemption or acquisition of any of its shares.
The amendment to section 1 drops the word
"acquisition", so that it is provided that
income includes:
Amounts received by the taxpayers in the year as

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I cannot say that, but
the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon.

Mr. Euler) bas had so much success with
amendments he bas proposed that he might
give some thought to trying what he suggests, when we get to the committee stage.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The end is not yet!
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Section 3 deals with
terminal funding plans. A terminal funding
plan is the kind of pension plan which is not
funded by the employer until the employee
the
becomes eligible upon retirement:
employer then makes the contribution to
provide the pension, and he is entitled in
accordance with the provisions of the Income
Tax Act to a reduction therefor from income
tax otherwise payable. But situations have
arisen, and may arise again, in which a man
who, having reached retirement age, is
entitled to retire, does not retire but goes
on working. As the law stands, under those
circumstances the employer had no right
to claim for a deduction for the contribution.
The amending words contained in section 3
are "becomes eligible to retire". If a man,
having reached retirement age, becomes
eligible to retire, the benefit of the contribution by the employer to the man's pension accrues to the employer, even though
the man continues to work.
Section 4 repeals the provision that provincial corporation taxes are not deductible
in computing income. It has to do with provincial corporation taxes which might or
might not be allowed as a deduction from
income of the corporation. There is a
provision in the act under which the
arbitrary line was drawn to the effect that
deductions would be allowable for corporation taxes payable on or before March 1941,
but not in respect of taxes which came into
force after that date. In some quarters this
distinction provoked discussion and controversy, and what is done by section 4 of this
bill is to delete the provision including these
latter taxes among those which are not
deductible. The effect of striking it out is
not to qualify all provincial corporation
taxes as deductible. It is simply that, in order
to be deductible, a provincial corporation tax
will have to qualify under the general provisions of the law as an expense of doing
business.
Section 5 deals with interest on bonds. Let
me illustrate one peculiar situation which
exists under the present Act. A person sells
some bonds at some time between two
interest dates. The purchaser lias to pay, in
addition to the current market price of the
bonds, the amount of interest accrued on
the bonds at the date of purchase. It might

be argued that the seller of the bonds has
sold the right to receive that interest, and
that the total interest lur the full pcriod
is taxable income in the hands of the purchaser. This amendment is designed to clarify
such a situation. The amount paid to the
seller for interest accrued at the time he sells
the bonds will be regarded as income in his
hands.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask the honourable
gentleman how the income tax department
will be able to check on this? When I cash
bond coupons I sign a certificate to the effect
that the money bas been received by me,
and when I pay my income tax the department checks to see whether I have shown
as income the amount stated on the certificate. But if I have bought the bonds between
two interest dates the seller has received the
interest for part of the year.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: It would be presumptuous for me to attempt to say what methods
the department may use to catch up with
these things. However, I am sure the purchaser would be on the side of the income tax
collector, for he would be stuck for the total
amount of interest unless he could show that
he had acquired title to the bond at some
time between two interest dates. It must be
remembered that all bonds are not bearer
bonds. The honourable gentleman bas illustrated a case concerning bearer bonds with
coupons attached. When such coupons are
cashed a declaration of the amount received
bas to be filed. There is also a complete
record of transfers of fully registered bonds,
the interest on which is paid by cheque made
out to the registered holders. The departmental officials will get along all right, for in
the past they have been able to obtain information concerning much more difficult cases.
The purchaser will be most anxious to help
the income tax ýcollector, and I am sure the
officials of the department will resolve any
difficulties.
Hon. Mr. Reid: They do very well.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: I have not yet studied
the section. May I ask what happens when a
bond three years in default say, is sold? Does
the seller have to include in his income the
interest which bas accrued on that bond,
although it may never be paid?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I am not in a position to
answer my friend. He is referring to a
special case. The type of situation contemplated by section 6 is one where the bonds are
in good standing and the interest bas been
paid. Entirely different questions arise if one
sells bonds that are in default, and I would
be just expressing an opinion were I to try

APRIL 19, 1953
to answer those questions. At this time I
would simply prefer to inform the house how
the department is attempting to deal with
various matters covered by the amendments.
I certainly do not regard it as part of my
duty at this time to make any comment on
whether I think the amendments will prove
effective. I am frank to say that I am not
ready to give any considered answer to the
question raised by my honourable friend.
Section 6 deals with cases where a husband
and wife are in a business. At present if a
husband is in business and he pays his wife
a salary he cannot deduct the amount as a
business expense, but the salary which the
wife receives is not taxable in her hands. In
other words, it is not regarded as income to
her. A recent amendment to this part of
the Income Tax Act provided what might be
an advantage when a salary passed from husband to wife, or vice versa. The purpose of the
present amendment is to shut off that advantage. Subsection 10 of section 11 of the Act
allows a deduction for an assistant or a substitute where there is a contract of employment.
Therefore, if a wife has a contract of employment as an assistant or substitute, her salary
is a deductible item of expense of business.
That loophole is now being closed.
Section 7 deals with dependent children.
The exemption of $400 which is at present
allowed, in computing the taxable income of
individuals, in respect of dependent children
under twenty-one years of age is to be
allowed in respect of dependent children over
twenty-one years of age if they are in fulltime attendance at a school or university. This
exemption is also extended in respect of
dependent grandchildren of the taxpayer.
Section 8 deals with medical expenses. The
amendment does not disturb the ceiling, which
was increased last year from $1,000 to $2,000
in certain circumstances, but it lowers the
floor at which medical expenses become
deductible. It reduces the minimum from 4
per cent of the taxpayer's income to 3 per
cent. The amendment is also intended to
overcome the difficulty that may arise when
the taxpayer belongs to a medical plan and
the payment of medical bills on his behalf is
delayed beyond the twelve-month period in
which he wishes to include them for 'income
tax -purposes.
But the taxpayer bas the option of choosing a twelve-month period in respect of
which to claim a deduction for medical
expenses, and even when the bill is
not paid under the hospital plan within the
twelve month period he is entitled to claim
the deduction if the bill is payable under
the plan within that twelve-month period.

Hon. Mr. Reid: Would such a deduction be
allowed under the British Coumbia hospitalization scheme?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I am talking not about
the cost of buying hospitalization, but about
the expense which a taxpayer incurs because
of illness, in the way of medical or hospital
expenses.
Section 9 amends section 27.
It is a
complicated section, but I think it has been
simplified considerably this year. The amendment expands and relieves some of the hardness of the block that was put in originally
by section 27 and the succeeding sections
against the passing of dividends from a
subsidiary company to the controlling company. The new subsection (1-J) of section
27 deals with cases where several subsidiary
companies have a common parent and one
of the subsidiary companies wants to acquire
the shares of the other subsidiary companies.
It is provided that the block does not apply
if the par value shares are acquired for no
more than their par value, or if shares of no
par value are acquired for no higher price
than the original paid-in capital in respect of
those shares.
A new subsection (1K) is added, in respect
of "control period". If for instance, a company paid a dividend, say in February of
this year, and in May of this year another
company acquired immediate control of the
company, then the company controlled
becomes a controlled company under the
Act and the control period is extended back
to the 1st of January, the beginning of the
taxation period. So, by that provision, the
dividend, although paid before control was
acquired, is drawn into the control period.
The amendment is provided for the purpose
of indicating that the dividend so paid before
control was actually acquired, yet paid within
the control period according to the Act, is
chargeable against designated surplus; and
the other parts of the section do not apply.
I will try to simplify another complicated
provision in section 9. I think I explained
last year that when a company was likely
to pay a substantial dividend some shareholders, to avoid including it in taxable
income, would seil their shares to a broker.,
who would receive the dividend from the
company tax free, and subsequently sell back
the shares at a lower price, or even at a loss,
which he would charge to operating costs.
When we were amending the act last year we
put in a block against that sort of thing, so
that a broker who has taken a dividend in
those circumstances could not charge off a
loss subsequently incurred in the sale of
those shares, unless he had held them for at
least 365 days, and in no event could he

SENATE
charge off such a loss if the number of
qhnrps he held was greater than 5 per cent of
the issued share capital. This amendment
is to make it clear that if there are two
or more classes of stock, the 5 per cent means
5 per cent of each class of issued shares,
and not 5 per cent of the overall issued share
capital.
Subsection (1) of section 10 gives the
graduated rates of personal income tax for
1954 and subsequent years, and subsection
2 gives the graduated rates of tax which
are to apply for 1953. Subsection 3 provides a special table where the taxable income
does not exceed $3,000 and there is some
element of investment income in it. It also
provides that, the old age security tax may
be included in the table.
Section 11 deals with pension funds. The
Canadian National Railway Company pension
fund is a case in point. A person under a
pension plan may become eligible to receive
some payments from it while still working
and before he has reached retirement age,
and the plan is intended to continue. If a
lump sum is received the recipient might
thereby be made liable to pay a large income
tax in one year. Section 11 ameliorates his
position by providing that when a single payment is received out of the pension plan, and
the plan is to continue, the recipient is
entitled to be put on the same basis as he is
in relation to other lump sum payments, and
the tax is determined by taking an average
of his rate of tax over the three years preceding the taxation year. In other words, his
effective tax rate is the average of his rate for
the three preceding years.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: May I ask the honourable
senator a question arising out of the statement
he has just made? If a lump sum paid to a
person enjoying the privilege or benefit of the
pension amounts to, say, $3,000 and he invests
it, will be be taxed on the revenue derived
from it?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: We are talking about a
lump sum received, which has the character
of income. The question is, what rate of tax
is to be applied in that year when the
employee's total income is extraordinarily
high, relatively speaking? The amendment
cuts his tax down to an effective rate, which
is the average of his tax over the preceding
three years. But once be receives the money,
if he uses it in such 'a way that it earns
income, he must pay a tax on that income
for the year in which he receives it.
Section 12 deals with credits for dividends.
Honourable senators will recall that several
years ago the Minister of Finance referred to
the beginning of what he hoped was a practice

that might ultimately lead to the avoidance
of double taxation, as where a company pays
income tax on its profits, and te shiaeholdeis
in turn have to pay income tax on the
dividends. As a start in the right direction
years ago a provision was then made whereby
a shareholder could deduct from tax otherwise payable 10 per cent of the amount of
dividends received from taxable corporations
in Canada. By section 12 of the bill before
us the 10 per cent is increased to 20 per cent.
In that regard the section implements budget
resolution No. 4. Provision is made by which
the old age security tax does not enter into
the calculations arising out of the 20 per cent
dividend credit. The term "dividend" is
given a broader interpretation by this section.
For instance, under the present law when a
husband gives dividends to his wife or a
minor under nineteen years of age, they are
attributable to the husband and he is taxed on
them. By the proposed amendment dividends
so attributed te the husband for taxation purposes qualify for the 20 per cent credit.
Section 13 of the bill implements budget
resolution No. 3 and reduces the rates of tax
on corporate earnings. Originally on income
up to $10,000 the tax was 10 per cent. This
year the earnings of a company up to $20,000
will be taxed at the rate of 18 per cent. The
general corporate rate has been reduced from
50 per cent to 47 per cent. In my reference
to the general corporate rate of 47 per cent
and the special rate of 18 per cent on income
of $20,000, I do not include the special old
age security tax, which would increase both
percentages by 2 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Do I understand that the
2 per cent applies only to corporation income
of $20,000, or does it apply to all income?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: It applies to al income.
The effective rate of the corporate tax,
including old age security tax, on the first
$20,000, would be 20 per cent; on the amount
of income in excess of $20,000 it would be
49 per cent. The new rate of 20 per cent
replaces the rate of 22 per cent paid in 1952,
and the rate of 49 per cent replaces the old
rate of 52 per cent.
It should be pointed out that this section
contains a new subsection 3A which permits
the allocation of that $20,000 income among
related companies. Under the present law
only one of several related companies can
claim that credit. By the proposed amendment the companies may get together and
make an agreement among themselves as to
the allocation of the credit, and the department will recognize that agreement.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Suppose they cannot agree?

APRIL 16, 1953
Hon. Mr. Hayden: If they do not agree they
do not get the benefit of the allocation, or
the minister may determine which related
company shall get the benefit.
Section 14 applies particularly to the
province of Quebec, and has to do with a
province which bas not made a tax rental
agreement with the federal authorities. The
credit of 5 per cent paid on corporate taxes
under the present Act has now been increased
to 7 per cent and would apply to the earnings
of a corporation in that province. That
implements budget resolution No. 5, and
becomes effective for the year 1953 and thereafter.
Section 15, with the marginal note of
"foreign tax", is rather complicated, but I
think I can make its meaning clear in a few
sentences. The explanatory note on the
opposite page reads:
The new subsection (5) will permit a taxpayer
under conditions to be prescribed by regulation to
claim a deduction from tax in respect of certain
taxes, other than taxes on income, that are paid to
a foreign country.

Some countries have income tax, excess
profits tax and what is called declared capital
tax. The declared capital tax is tied in with
the excess profits tax, and the higher you
make your declared capital, the lower will
be your excess profits; and the higher you
make your declared capital and the more
capital tax you pay, the lower will be your
excess profits tax.
Representations have
been made that in those circumstances the
matter should be looked at in its entirety,
because it is all in the nature of income tax.
Under section 15 the department would give
relief on a basis to be prescribed by regulations.
Section 16 has to do with the averaging
of income for income tax purposes by farmers
and fishermen. Very briefly, at present a
fisherman or a farmer who seeks to take
advantage of the averaging provisions must
have filed his return on time in each of the
four proceeding years, and also must file on
time in the year in which a claim is made for
the right to average. A farmer or a fisherman who bas complied with this requirement
is allowed to strike an average rate of tax
over the five years, and by doing so he may
well become entitled to a refund. Difficulties
arose under this provision by reason of the
fact that if the taxpayer failed to file on time
in any one of four years he broke the continuity and had to start all over again. Under
the section now before us, if he is late in
filing in, say, the fourth year, he merely skips
that year and goes on to the next year and
eventually makes up his five years. There is,
however, a maximum limit of two years in
which he may be guilty of late filing. If he

fails to file on time for more than two years
he must start his averaging period all over
again.
An additional concession is given to farmers
and fishermen under section 16. Under the
present law a farmer or fisherman who filed
his returns on an averaging basis could not
revoke. It might happen that by reason of
disallowance by the department on his
returns, his assessment would show that it
was not to his advantage to file on an averaging basis. The amendment would allow him
to revoke his filing on that basis within
thirty days after receiving his notice of
assessment.
Section 17 of the bill deals with that rather
famous matter having to do with depreciation called "recapture". It simply means that
if on a property acquired at a certain capital
cost you have written off depreciation on
the diminishing balance basis over a period of
years, and you then sell the property at a
gain, the income tax department recaptures
to the extent of the write-off that you have
made, and brings that recaptured amount into
income.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Is that not section 18?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: What bill do you have
before you?
Hon. Mr. Euler: An Act to amend the
Income Tax Act, first reading.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: In the bill as passed by
the other house the sections were renumbered.
With respect to recapture a concession is
made by which the taxpayer, instead of being
faced with a lump sum payment in one year,
may spread it over a period of five years.
There is, however, this qualification, which
works a hardship. An individual who seeks
to spread out the payment must have been
a resident in Canada during the five-year
period; and a corporation may not take
advantage of this provision unless it has carried on business in Canada for a period of
five years. The rigour of this requirement is
lessened by the provision in section 17 that
if an individual bas been resident only two,
or three, or four years he may spread the
payment. If he bas been resident more than
two years and not more than three, the period
is the three immediately preceding years; if
more than three years and not more than
four, the period is the four immediately preceding years; and if more than four years,
the period is the five years immediately
preceding.
Section 18 is an ameliorating section. Under
the present law, where a partner or proprietor of a business died after the close of a fiscal
period but before the end of the calendar

SENATE
year in which the fiscal period closed-let us
nuqi1me that the fiscal period ended on
September 30 and the man died in October or
mid-November--it was necessary to file a
separate return for the period following the
end of the fiscal year. That might or might
not work to the advantage of the taxpayer's
estate, because the possibility of substantial
loss and the question of carrying back would
be involved. So the subsection is changed
to provide an option. If it suits better the
purpose of the estate, separate returns may be
filed; if it is more advantageous ta combine
the last fiscal period plus the period until the
death of the partner or proprietor, one return
may be filed to cover both periods.
Section 19 has to do with a section of the
act, which has provoked some controversy,
dealing with the case of brokers who have
accumulated in their possession dividends
from street certificates. A street certificate is
one which may be in the name of a broker
and is passed through a succession of brokers
until, finally, the beneficial owner is unknown
to the broker named in the certificate. In the
past that broker has regarded himself-and,
as a matter of law, I believe correctly-as
liable to pay at any time the amount of these
dividends to any persan who may turn up and
prove himself to be the beneficial owner and
demand them. In most cases, I doubt whether
income tax in respect of these accumulations
of dividends in the hands of brokers, where
the owners are unknown, is accounted for.
But there is now a specific provision to the
effect that the obligation is imposed on the
broker in respect of these accumulations ta
withhold 25 per cent and pay it ta the
Receiver General. This requirement becomes
mandatory for the first time in 1954, in relation ta accumulations for the twelve months
preceding January 1 next. But the catch is
contained in a subsection which states that
all accumulations in 1952 and previous taxation years shall be regarded as having come
in within the twelve months prior ta
January 1, 1954. Su all past accumulations
are brought into that year, and the 25 per
cent withheld for the account of the unknown
beneficial owner is ta be remitted ta the government. As and when he comes along and
claims his dividends he gets them, less the
25 per cent which has been withheld; and
the broker is protected.
There may be a question whether this
provision should embrace sa long a period as
twenty or twenty-five years, or as far back
as taxes on income of this kind have been
payable. That, I suppose, is a matter we can
properly discuss in committee. I have my
own view of it, but I suppose one can argue
the point either way. It is certain that a

good many people have been in business and
gone out of business and have taken these
i1± some fashion, or the
accumulatuom,
accumulations have got lost in the period of
years that has elapsed, so that the only
persons who will be caught by reason of this
change are those who have had a continuity
of operation and have accounted for it in
such a way that the amount is shown in the
records. To my mind it is a moot question.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think so too-very moot.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The complaints from
some sources have been very vocal.
Section 20 is a relieving section. Until the
present time, if the taxpayer had made an
overpayment, and the fact was determined
by a decision of the appeal board or the
courts, or by a decision of the minister that
the assessment was too high, the interest
payable was only 2 per cent. That amount
has been stepped up to 6 per cent.
Charitable trusts are dealt with in section
21, which permits them to make expenditures
in respect of charitable activities carried on
by them. It amends section 57, which permitted charitable foundations to expend
money in relation to · heir activities but made
t
no similar provision in respect of charitable
trusts. The new section puts the two kinds
of organizations on a parallel basis.
Subsection 2 of the sarne section has ta
do with credit unions. The interest which a
credit union receives from the loans it makes
to its members is not taxable, nor is the
interest it may derive from government bonds
held by it. But some credit unions have a
practice of charging a fee for cashing a
cheque for a member. The new section
exempts from income tax a fee or accumulation of fees for this service, and provides
further that the interest received by a credit
union on a loan made by it to its parent,
some co-operative society, is not to be interpreted as constituting income.
In the new subsection (5) of the sarne section there is a further provision relating ta
new charitable foundations and charitable
trusts. These bodies are exempt from the
payment of income tax in the first year, even
though they may not be able within that
period to meet the requirements of the act as
it stands to distribute 90 per cent of their
income for charitable purposes. The matter
is dealt with by a provision that in their
second year of operation the disbursements
they have made to the extent of 90 per cent
in that year are attributed to the first year.
There is an existing provision that a charitable
foundation or trust may set up reserves equal
to the amount of its income in the preceding
year. By this means charitable trusts and

APRIL 16, 1953
foundations are enabled to "get going" without doing violence to the scheme of the sections as now in force.
Section 22 provides a minor change which
was requested by some trust companies. It
concerns estates that have an earned income
from foreign sources. The present law provides
that the income of an estate from sources in a
foreign country shall be deemed to be income
for the taxation year from that foreign
country. The purpose of the amendment is to
enable the estate to designate residual beneficiaries as entitled to the benefit of the credit
for the tax paid to foreign countries.
Section 23 deals with dividends from personal corporations. The amendment repeals
subsections (6D) and (6E) of section 61 of the
act and substitutes new subsections of the
same numbers. New subsection (6D) deals
with personal corporations and tax credits in
relation to dividends received by individuals
therefrom, and, by formula, prescribes what
portion is to be taken as dividend deduction.
The amendment permits the tax credit to pass
through more than one personal corporation
to the individual shareholder.
Subsection (6E) similiarly permits foreign
tax deductions to pass through more than one
personal corporation to the individual shareholder.
Section 24 of the bill deals with undistributed income on hand, and amends section 73A
of the aet. It provides that premiums paid by
corporations on the redemption of any of its
shares, other than common shares, shall be
deducted in computing undistributed income
on hand; and that premiums paid by a corporation on the acquisition of any of its shares,
other than common shares, shall also be
deductible, with the exception of premiums
paid for the acquisition of shares prior to
February 20, 1953.
Section 73A of the Act is further amended
by the addition of subsection (12) which permits the tax paid on undistributed income in
the hands of one corporation to become tax
paid undistributed income in the hands of
other corporations owning shares of the first
corporation. This amendment is to clarify
certain difficulties that have arisen under the
section.
Section 25 implements paragraph 13 of the
Income Tax Resolution. It extends the exemption of income from metalliferous or industrial
mineral mines for the first three years of
production to mines coming into production
during the calendar year 1956. This is an
extension we have been pushing ahead each
year so as to keep in force the three-year
benefit for new mines coming into production.
Section 26 deals with crown companies.
Last year we passed an amendment making
certain income of crown companies subject to

income tax. The present amendment applies
to a situation where the government turns
over some property or other asset to a crown
company to sell. The profit from the disposal
of that property or other asset is not to be
regarded as income of the crown corporation.
Section 27 of the bill deals with the special
rates that were provided last year with respect
to electrie, gas or steam corporations. In this
instance the amendment is of a consequential
nature. The general rates of taxation having
been changed, the rates provided for electric, gas or steam corporations must be altered
accordingly.
Section 28, an important one, deals with
benefits to employees. The amendment adds
a new section 75A, which provides that in
the income of an employee of a corporation
there shall be included any benefits the
employee receives as a result of an agreement under which he receives shares, or
rights to acquire shares, of the corporation
at less than their value at the time of
acquisition. This deals with stock options
and stock purchase plans that exist in some
companies. The element which is to be
regarded as taxable will be the difference
between the price at which these shares may
be acquired by the employee and their going
value at the time of the transaction.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: How is this established?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: It is easily established
if the shares are listed.
Hon. Mr. Reid: What is meant by the words
"arms length" which are used in this section?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The use of these words
is explained in the definition section of the
act. A transaction which is not at arms
length would involve corporations controlled
directly or indirectly by the same person, or
persons connected by blood relationship, marriage or adoption. In other words, an "arms
length" transaction would be one conducted
between strangers.
Section 75A (2) provides that where an
employee is deemed to have received a benefit under this section he may elect to pay
tax on the benefit at the rate by which his
effective rate of tax for three years preceding the taxation year exceeds 20 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I interrupt to ask a
question? Suppose a company issues bonds
with the right of conversion, before December
1, 1953, into ten shares of common stock for
every bond. If I pay $1,000 for one of these
bonds at a time when the market price of
the shares is $100 each, and I convert it into
ten common shares which I sell at $125 each
before the end of the year, do I become liable
to pay income tax on my profit of $250?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Not according to anythine I have said. This section merely deals
with the benefits to employees of a corporation.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is all I wanted to know.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I should like to call
attention to the fact that section 28 introduces
a new law dealing with special reserves. This
has to do with amounts received in a taxable year on account of services not rendered
or goods not delivered as well as deposits
on containers. Honourable senators know
that, for instance, strips of tickets are sold
in the operation of dairy and bakery businesses, and that milk is sold in containers,
in respect of which deposits are taken. The
Income Tax Appeal Board has held the
revenue from the sale of such tickets to be
income of the year in which it was received,
and the company concerned has not been
permitted to make allowance for unused
tickets. Now, this bill provides for a new
subsection 75B which enumerates these
special reserves, and establishes certain rules
for setting them up. The first rule requires
that for the year 1953 the company must
bring into its income all the reserves it
had accumulated in previous years in relation to these items. It then provides the
basis on which a reserve may be set up for
the year. The reserve is fixed at a reasonable
amount. And there is this limitation in respect to unreturned containers for which the
deposit is claimed: all items of money
received, including the deposits, must be
brought into income. At the end of the
year a quantity of containers will be represented by deposits held for unreturned containers. The company is entitled to set up a
reserve against those containers which have
not come back, but the maximum reserve that
can be set up is the amount that has been
taken into income with respect to them. In
other words, if at the end of the year you had
$500 by way of deposits for unreturned containers, that would be the maximum reserve
you could set up. I do not want to burden
the bouse with a lot of detail about these
special reserves, but I think it is important
to state that there is this ameliorating provision.
Hon. Mr. Davis: What is the effect of the
Act if cartons are used instead of bottles as
milk containers?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Some milk companies
do use wax paper boxes instead of bottles,
but I understand those containers are not
reissued.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: In other words, they are
consumable.

Hon. Mr. Davis: I know one company whose
yards are piled up high with containers,
old bottles and boxes.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Containers fall into two
categories. If something used as a container
is consumable or destructible, so that it cannot be used a second time, then it is charged
to cost of operation. But if a container is
capable of being used a number of times, how
is the deposit to be treated in the first
instance? This section says the deposit must
be brought in as income for the year. It also
says that a reserve must be set up not
greater than deposits received to the end of
the year. A full explanation appears in the
explanatory note opposite page 20 and it
will amplify what I have said.
There is also provision with respect to
policy reserves of insurance companies.
Instead of specifying all the details that
might be required in spelling out policy
reserves, and what insurance companies may
do in setting them up, the provision has been
made very broad. An insurance company,
other than a life insurance company, may
deduct such amounts by way of policy
reserves as may be approved by the Superintendent of Insurance.
There is also a provision in respect of
unearned commissions of insurance agents,
other than life insurance agents. While the
full commission that is received must be
brought into income, there is a provision for
setting up a reserve for the portion that has
not been earned during the current fiscal
year and carries into the next year.
Section 29 increases the salaries of the
Income Tax Appeal Board.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It seems rather strange that
in the present section 29 the salary of the
chairman should be set at $13,333.33. I do
not know of any official in any other department whose salary is worked out to odd
cents.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I can give no explanation for that. All that section 29 does is to
increase the salary of the Chairman of the
Income Tax Appeal Board from $13,333.33
to $14,400; that of the Assistant Chairman
from $12,000 to $13,000; and that of each of
the other members of the board from $10,000
to $11,000.
Section 30 deals with the procedure on
appeal.
Section 31 is with respect to the fee upon
filing notice of appeal. A fee of $15 is to be
paid to the Income Tax Appeal Board when
launching an appeal. This amendment is to
make it clear that if the appellant ultimately
succeeds he is entitled to get his $15 back.

APRIL 16, 1953
Section 32 provides for disposal of appeal
by the board, and this involves some clarification of the existing section.
Section 33 deals with cross-appeals, when
the respondent wishes to appeal from the
decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board.
Section 34 is consequential upon the addition of the new subsection (3) to section 95A.
The explanatory note opposite page 25 says:
The present law does not permit a subsidiary
controlled corporation to elect to pay the 15 per
cent tax on undistributed income earned alter the
end of its 1949 taxation year. The new subsection
(3) permits a subsidiary controlled corporation that
is subsidiary to a personal corporation to make
such an election on the same basis as corporations
that are not controlled subsidiaries.
Subsection 4 also is purely consequential
upon the new subsection (3).
Section 35 adds a new part, "Part IB,"
which deals with tax on premiums paid on
redemption or acquisition of capital stock.
This is related to section 1, to which I referred
at the beginning of my explanation today.
Up to the present time the premium received
by a shareholder, on the redemption or acquisition of shares was part of his income on
which he had to pay tax. The amendments
do away with that and impose a new kind
of tax, and provide that a corporation which
redeems or acquires any of its shares, other
than common shares, at a premium, shall
pay a tax of 20 per cent on the amount of
the premium; or if it has any tax-paid
undistributed income on hand, to that extent
it may deduct the tax and pay the tax of
20 per cent on the balance remaining. The
same thing applies where a corporation has
acquired, other than by redemption, its preference shares at a premium. The effective
date as to acquisition is on and after February 20, 1953, and as to redemption, after
April 30, 1953.
Section 36 adds a certain section and subsections to section 96 of the act. It has to
do with Part II, which deals with the tax
on income from Canada of non-resident persons. This section of the bill has to do with
the question of interest in that connotation.
The explanatory note opposite page 27 of
the bill makes this section clear, and it is
scarcely necessary for me to attempt to paraphrase or even to iread the note.
Section 37 is complementary to section 5
of the bill, and would amend section 97 (5)
of the present Income Tax Act. Subsection
4A, on page 28 of the bill, covers the case
where a non-resident sells bonds to a resident
of Canada between interest dates. There is
provision for the withholding of tax by the
purchaser in relation to the portion of interest
paid to the non-resident, as part of the purchase price of the bond. As I have said, it is
complementary to the item I discussed undeir

section 5 of the bill, having to do with interest
on bonds sold in Canada between interest
dates. The section now before us deals with
the converse situation, that of a non-resident
vendor selling a bond to a resident between
interest periods. There is an element there
with respect to which the purchaser in Canada
must withhold the tax and remit it to the
Receiver General.
Section 38, which is for the purpose of
clarification, amends section 104 of the act.
I come now to section 39, on page 28
of the bill. Under section 48 of the present
act the minister, in a case where he feels
there has been evasion, may not only make
an assessment but may issue a demand for
immediate payment. But even though he may
be satisfied there is an evasion and makes an
immediate assessment, he must wait thirty
days after the assessment before issuing a certificate. It is felt that in those circumstances
he should be able to act forthwith without the
intervention of thirty days, so that he may proceed immediately to round up the assets of a
delinquent taxpayer in order to meet the
assessment. Section 39 would allow immediate certification by the minister in those
circumstances.
Section 40 deals with non-resident persons carrying on business in Canada. Existing regulations require then to file a return
and pay the tax thereon. And section 41
provides penalties for failure to make a return
and to pay the tax. Though these amendments would not have a very extensive application, there are some instances in which
they would be useful, for a non-resident company, instead of being required to withhold
taxes, would be obligated to file a return and
remit payment with the return at the end
of the year. The provision for penalties
would make their compliance with the law
doubly sure.
Section 42 would amend the definition section, section 127 of the act. Under present
provisions parents of a child who becomes
sixteen in the month of December may claim
an exemption, according to the strict wording
of the definition, of $150 instead of $400. As
will be seen from the explanatory note on
the opposite page, the amendment would
enlarge the definition so that the parents
would not be penalized to that extent.
Subsection 2 defines "employer" and
"employee". We have all heard of the pension
plan proposed for members of the House of
Commons. This is referred to in the explanatory note, otherwise I would not mention it.
The meaning of the word "employee" is
expanded so that the pension plan may be
approved of for income tax purposes.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Reid: What words would apply
to the members of the House of Commons?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The present Act defines
the word "officer" as including a member
of parliament.
Paragraph (ka) defines
"employee" as including "officer". The bill
includes members of the House of Commons,
who for the purposes of this Act are officers,
in the definition of "employee", in order that
the pension plan proposed for members of
that house may be entitled to approval for
income tax purposes.
Subsection 3 adds a new subsection 9 to
section 127 of the act. This has to do with a
pension plan covered by an annuity contract.
If an employee leaves his employment, takes
his portion of the annuity contract and makes
no change in it, he retains it until its maturity
and draws benefits from it free of tax; but if
under the same circumstances he takes his
portion of the annuity contract before retirement and changes it into something else, this
subsection requires that the portion of the
annuity contract which he received shall be
valued before the change is made, and the
valuation is deemed to be income and subject
to tax in the year in which he received it.
Honourable senators will note that section
43, carrying the marginal note "tax on tax"
relates to no section of the Income Tax Act
which it would amend. The reason is that
this section does not amend the act. It bas
to do with such a case as this: A railway
company takes a lease on a property at a
rental of $10,000 a year, and agrees to pay any
income tax which the lessor-that is the one
who owns the land-is obliged to pay by
reason of receipt of the rental. Such a case
results in the calculation of tax on tax. Section 43 provides a formula which is limited
to a contract made before the coming into
force of the section. The effect of the formula
is that while the lessor must include rental
income in his total income for income tax
purposes, he shall calculate his tax on that
income separately from other income. In
other words, the rent is part of his income,
but it is not lumped with his general income
for taxation purposes. On the other hand,
the lessee-that is the one who rents the
land-is not entitled to charge up as expense
the portion of the so-called rent which is tax.
I do not need to take any time on section
34, which deals merely with a printing error.
Section 45, "deductions for oil, gas and
mining corporations", implements paragraphs
9 and 10 of the budget resolutions having to
do with oil, gas and mining corporations. A
mining company which engages also in oil
and gas exploration is entitled to the benefits
of the deduction prescribed. In other words,

the allowances are exchangeable. An oil and
gas company which carries on some mining
operations benents by the allowdueb income

tax-wise, in relation to its mining operations;
and correspondingly, the benefits which flow
from oil and gas operations by a mining company are extended to the mining company.
Heretofore that sort of reciprocity did not
exist. The notes opposite page 31 explain the
matter very clearly.
It remains only for me to draw your attention to subsection (3A), page 32, concerning
bonus payments. In Alberta, companies can
buy at government auctions oil leases. If a
company, having bought an oil lease and
made a substantial payment, goes ahead with
development and finds that it is not an
economic process, that either oil cannot be
found or only in insufficient quantities, and
the enterprise is abandoned, upon surrender
of its right it is entitled to write off the
amount of the payment. But if the compainy
should go ahead and work the property for a
while, and then abandon it, the cost is treated
in the ordinary way as a capital asset and no
write-off is permitted. Subsection (5A) deals
with deep test wells and the benefits which
may be obtained in respect of expenditures.
The concessions made under last year's bill
are extended, and the nature of these, with
certain limitations, can be gathered from the
explanatory note. This section implements
budget resolution No. 11.
I have stated in 'a hurried way-though the
explanation has taken more time than I
thought it would-the effect of the amendments contained in this bill. I have not
attempted an exhaustive analysis: I have not
stated, and do not intend to state, that the
sections 'accomplish fully the purposes for
which they are intended, but I have given a
general explanation of what they are intended
for.
Last year, in closing my remarks on the
Income Tax Act amendments then before us,
I raised two points, which I thought deserved
consideration by the government. My voice
could not have been raised very loudly,
because neither of these matters has been
dealt with, so I shall have to follow the
practice of repetition, hoping it may set up
such a current or succession of currents that
ultimately they will come in on some wave
length which is used by a responsible officer
of the crown, and we may get relief.
My first contention was that if a taxpayer is
assessed by the Minister of National Revenue
a sum ýin excess of the amount that he returns
as income, and pays the tax demanded, and is
forced to go to the Income Tax Appeal Board
and to the courts to establish that his return
was correct, and if the decision of the court

APRIL 16, 1953
supports his claim that the extra or increased
assessment made by the department was
wrong, in law that taxpayer should 'be entitled
to charge as an expense the cost of defending
himself and to deduct it from his income tax
payment, or, at least, from income upon
which income tax is payable. Hitherto the
department bas insisted that expenditures so
made are not for the purpose of earning
income, and therefore are not deductible.
With respect to the second item, I would
explain that for customs or sales tax purposes
a man files the necessary customs entry forms,
values are stated, a levy is made for sales
tax, and it is paid. It may be-indeed these
cases happen, and frequently-that after two
or three years the department, for customs
purposes, will review these entries and determine that the value which was stated and used
is not the fair market value in the home
country or country of origin of the goods and
therefore more duty is payable, plus a penalty.
The basis of applying that higher rate or
increased value may have legal validity, but
my position has been and is that if what in
those circumstances the taxpayer has done
has been done without fraud-that is, if the
statement he made and his entry for customs
purposes were honestly, not fraudulently
made, or if the basis of payment for sales tax
is an honest basis and no allegation of fraud
can be supported-the taxpayer who is called
upon to pay those additional moneys should be
permitted to deduct them as an expense
against his cost of operation. But if an application for this purpose is made to the income tax
authorities, and more than a year has passed
since the assessment was made, the applicant
is told, "It is too bad, we will not entertain
an application for a refund." The taxpayer
bas sold the goods on the basis of a certain cost,
including duty paid and/or sales tax; he has
made his return and acquired a certain profit
as a result of these transactions; and afterwards, without any fraud on his part, he is
subjected to a higher duty or a larger sales
tax, and he has no place ta reimburse himself
except from his own pocket.
I think that the two matters I have outlined are cases where some amelioration or
lessening of the rigour of the law should be
extended to the taxpayer; and I am going to
keep on talking about them until the authorities do something.
That is aill I have to say at the present time
with respect to the bill. I assume that in
accordance with our usual practice it will be
considered in detail in committee.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I do not intend to make a speech on this
bill, although at this time it is customary for
a member of the opposition or anyone else

who differs from the policy of the government, not only on income tax matters but
on any other aspect of financial policy, to
state his views. I feel very strongly that
the law in relation to income tax is so important, and its application is so general that
before any critical statements are made about
it the bill should go to committee, where,
having in our minds the explanation-I may
say, the very able explanation-of the honourable senator who has just taken his seat,
we may have further information from
departmental officials, so that we shall come
back with an understanding of the whole
problem. Therefore I shall not indulge in
any "budget" speech.
I think it is important that legislation such
as the Income Tax Bill should be thoroughly

gathered by the Standing Committee on
Finance in its annual study of the estimates
has always provided members with a background of knowledge which has helped them
immeasurably in dealing with these matters.
Unfortunately, however, that committee did
not examine the estimates this year.
I agree with the contention of the mover
that when a taxpayer has to go to court to
defend himself, and the court rules in his
favour, he should be entitled to charge as an
expense the legal costs he has incurred and
be able to deduct that amount from his income
tax payment. Let me give an illustration.
A gentleman came into my office some four
years ago and reported that he had been
renting machinery and deducting the rental
cost from his annual expenses. Apparently
there had been some oversight in drafting the
applicable section of the Income Tax Act and
he was able to do this. Let us say that the
machinery he rented was worth $60,000, and
that he was required to pay a yearly rental
of $8,000. He continued paying this amount
for seven years, by which time he had paid
a total of $56,000. He then went to the company and bought the machinery for the
amount left owing on it. The point is that
he got credit for the rent he paid on the
machine, less interest that had been charged
at 6 per cent. He was allowed to charge the
$8,000 annual rent for the machinery as an
expense item in each taxable year. Naturally
the income tax department tried to have this
expense disallowed, but he appealed and won
his case. Well, since that time the law bas
been amended and that loophole has been
closed. He paid legal fees amounting to
something like two or three thousand dollars,
but he was not permitted to deduct these
expenses from his income, even though his
lawyer had saved him some $10,000 or $12,000
in taxes. I object to that sort of thing.
A lawyer can make a client pay, and legal

fees are a legitimate expense to the taxpayer

to deduct in order

to arrive at his net income.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Is there not another
way of dealing with it? It could be provided
that the lawyer would not have to include
fees in his income.
Some Hon. Senalors: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, I have never been
able to get away with that sort of thing.
I should like to refer now to the subject
of rent control. Incidentally, this matter is
now in the hands of the provinces and is
rapidly falling into the hands of the municipalities. I suppose it will end up with the
school boards and finally be kicked out.
I maintain that a percentage of depreciation should be allowed on buildings each
year, as was done prior to some five years
ago. People simply will not build houses
for rental purposes unless depreciation is
allowed. There is no inducement for them
to build for rent, and builders would rather
sell.
A frame house in my community lasts for
about twenty years, and a brick house for
forty years. The cost of repairs and upkeep
to these structures practically equals their
total value at the end of those periods, yet
no exemption at all is allowed for depreciation. I think the depreciation provisions for
buildings should be put back in our statute
books, for they would greatly encourage the
building of houses for rent.
Honourable senators, I presume that this
bill will be sent to committee, and if it is I
would suggest that a stenographic report be
made of the proceedings and that authorization be given to print copies of the evidence.
This would make available to the people of
Canada, particularly accountants, lawyers,
merchants, bookkeepers, and so on, a written
record of the questions asked by senators
and the answers given by department
officials. Such a report would save us all a
great deal of time in trying to digest the

various sections of the Income Tax Bill, and
it would reflect on the Senate an importance
it deserves.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Hayden: Honourable senators, I
move that the bill be referred to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I am sure I express the sentiment of the
whole house in thanking the honourable
gentleman from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden)
for his very clear exposition of this important,
long and complicated bill. In his presentation
this afternoon he not only displayed great
powers of lucid analysis, but he also performed a feat of very considerable endurance.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
On the Motion to Adjourn:
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
while there are still several items on our
Order Paper, I intend to move that when
the Senate adjourns today it stand adjourned
until Tuesday evening next. As we have
already been told, the Divorce Committee has
a good deal of work before it tomorrow, and
honourable members of that committee will
need the day free in order to attend to that
work.
My general understanding of the
bills on the Order Paper is that, while they
are all important, none of them should provoke any extended discussion.
I may say that I expect to be out-of-town
on Monday and Tuesday next, but I hope to be
back by Tuesday evening. However, if for
any reason I am unable to return in time for
Tuesday's sitting, I would ask the honourable
senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) to
lead the bouse in my absence.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, April
21, at 8 p.m.

HISTORIC SITES AND MONUMENTS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. C. G. Hawkins moved the second reading of Bill 110, an Act to establish the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, the main purpose of this bill is to provide a statutory
authority for .the Historic Sites and Monuments Board, whose function is to act in an
advisory capacity to the Minister of Resources
and Development in the selection of national
historic sites.
For some time past the federal government
has recognized the need of preserving, as
part of our national heritage, the sites and
areas which have played historic roles in the
development of our great nation. With the
awakening of this realization, and as a result
of certain representations, the Minister of the
Interior of the day set up in 1919 an honorary
Historic Sites and Monuments Board to advise
the department on the subject of sites and
events deserving special recognition and commemoration.
The first board was composed of five authorities on history in Canada under the chairmanship of Brigadier General E. A. Cruickshank, of Ottawa.
All members served
without remuneration, but received an allowance of $10 per day and ordinary travelling
expenses to meetings away from their places
of residence.
In 1923 the board was reconstituted, its
membership raised to seven, and appointSECOND READINGS

a virgin land. The march of time has witnessed a succession of great achievements by
men of vision from the early .French settlements in Nova Scotia and Quebec, through
the unsettled years of the Seven Years War,
the American War of Independence, the
Rebellion of 1837, the Fenian Raids and uprising in the North-West in 1870 and 1885, and
the exploration and development of the Canadian West to the Pacific and Northwest to
the Arctie.
Since its inception in 1919, the Historie
Sites and Monuments Board has examined
for historical significance over one thousand
sites which have played an important role
in the economie, political and social growth
of this country. Of these, 623 have been
marked by the National Parks Branch, upon
approval by the minister, as being of national
importance, and, of these, 429 have been
marked or preserved as historie sites. In the
three fiscal years ending 1952-53, total
appropriations for construction and operation
of historie sites and National Historie parks
have averaged some $226,000 annually.
Authority is also sought under sections Il
and 12 of the National Parks Act for the
establishment of National Historie parks. This
provides that the Governor in Council may
set aside any land, title to which is vested
in Her Majesty, as a National Historie park
to commemorate an historie event of national
importance or to preserve any historie landmark or any object of historie or prehistoric
or scientific interest of national importance
and to bring it under certain provisions of
the National Parks Act for administrative
purposes. There are eleven National Historie
parks in Canada, and several museums have
been established to preserve exhibits and
relics pertaining to the early history of the
area.
In addition to these, steps have been taken
to perpetuate through stone and bronze, by
monument and tablet, the names of such great
Canadians as Laurier, Macdonald, King,
Bennett, Cartier; and, as recently announeed,
the name of Borden will be commemorated
by means of a statue to be erected on Parliament Hill.
The bill now presented provides for the
establishment of a board of twelve members,
ten of whom, representing the ten provinces,
will be appointed by the Governor in Council.
The other two members will be the Dominion
Archivist and the Chief Curator of the
National Museum. The chairman is to be
appointed by the Governor in Council, and
the appointed members will hold office for
periods not exceeding five years, although
retiring members will be eligible for reappointment.

As stated, the board will act in an advisory
capacity to the minister, whose power it is
to indicate the places to be iiarked and pieserved. Authority is also sought to establish
subject to the approval of the Governor in
council, historie museums and to acquire
land for such purposes.
There may be those in Canada who do not
appreciate to the fullest extent the significance of the work for which the Historie
Sites and Monuments Board was established.
Throughout the long history of man his
achievements have been in large part inspired
by the record of his forebears. That applied
in the case of the old world; it applies no less
to the new. No clearer example could be
cited than in the happy blending of races
whose achievements made Nova Scotia great
and are suitably commemorated through the
work of this board. There at Port Royal have
been reconstructed the Old Fort and Habitation, which stand as a fitting memorial to
both the privation endured in the earliest
French settlement in Canada and the adventurous spirit which led the first white men to
our shores. There too on the shores of Halifax Harbour, in the great fortress built by
the English, is exemplified the character and
stability of the earlier Anglo-Saxon pioneers.
There at Pictou, and in the Cape Breton Highlands, stand monuments to the sturdy Scot
who found in the new world freedom of
religion and fulfilment of his destiny to lead
rather than to follow. There, too, at Lunenburg, is memorialized for ever the work of
the thrifty Dutch and German settlers, men
of the sea, whose vocation was characterized
in the accomplishments of the famous saltbanker, the Bluenose.
As may be readily seen, then, there in the
little province of Nova Scotia were blended
together French and English, Celt and
German, races from far across the sea whose
earnest endeavours brought the new land to
early prominence.
The development of
Canada and her steady progression to a leading place in the world today was accomplished
by the exact process which characterized the
growth of Nova Scotia.
This was but the beginning. Farther west,
in the St. Lawrence river valley and on the
Great Lakes, the foundations of the new
country were being laid by former rivals.
In Upper and Lower Canada the vision of
great men carried them beyond the immediate
advantages of local warfare and conquest.
The struggle for responsible government
welded together the two great groups in a
common cause. As a result, the union of the
eastern provinces was achieved, and as the
torch of union was borne westward a great
country was born. The temper of the new

APRIL 21, 1953
nation which emerged from the heat of battle
and the strength of her pioneers have, within
our own times, been tried and found worthy.
The people from al quarters of the globe, of
every race and creed, who comprise the Canadian nation, have been forged together in a
common loyalty to Canada and have brought
this country to her present proud preeminence in the world.
Is it not proper, therefore, that the works
and deeds of our forefathers should be perpetuated in bronze and stone? The privations
and suffering of the pioneers have produced
a race of builders whose precept and example
may be regarded as the keystone of Canada's
greatness. May we in our small way prove
our appreciation and worthiness of that
glorious heritage.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the mover a
question? In looking over the bill I see no
provision requiring an annual report to be
placed before parliament. I am wondering
why a report of such a splendid board as
this should not be placed before parliament
each year?
Hon. Mr. Hawkins: Is that provision not
found in section 9 of the bill?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Section 9 provides that the
board shall submit a report to the minister,
but I do not see any section requiring the
report to be placed before parliament.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: The minister places it
before parliament.
Hon. Mr. Hawkins: Will the minister not
place the report before parliament? I understand that this is an advisory board which
makes a report to the minister, and I presume
that the minister will submit the report to
parliament. The bill establishes an advisory
board which is to make an annual report to
the minister.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
the merits of this entire subject were
thoroughly discussed by this house in the
debate on the report of the Standing Committee on Tourist Traffic. Many fine speeches
were made during that debate, and I recall
particularly the eloquent address of the honourable senator from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr.
Gershaw). The honourable gentleman from
Milford-Hants (Hon. Mr. Hawkins) has just
given us an excellent outline of the legislation before the house, and I should like to
make a few comments about the purpose
of the bill. Once good roads are built throughout Canada it will be advisable to establish
some kind of a record to draw the attention
of tourists to our historical sites. People
want to visit the historical sites and other

places of interest in the land where their
forefathers came from. Let me give an illustration. The citizens of my home city of
Winnipeg have preserved the first post office
established in that district. It has been made
a substation. Now, if I were a Winnipegger
who had gone to another part of the country
and decided to return for a visit, and my
father had talked about the old post office,
I think I would want to see it. I am told that
the original cost of that post office was about
$1,000. The new post office now being erected
will cost about $15 million. This gives one
some idea of the change in the times.
Hon. Mr. King: What about the gate at
Fort Garry?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am glad you mentioned
it. The Fort Garry Gate is in the right place
where it is. Fort Garry, adjoining the city
of Winnipeg, is really a suburban municipality. They want Winnipeg to give the gate
to Fort Garry. I do not want to get into that
struggle.
Hon. Mr. King: It is a historic site.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think the gate ought to
remain where it is.
And also the government have lower Fort
Garry. That was really the first fort in that
part of the country; and the site where the
battle of Seven Oaks was fought between the
Hudson's Bay Company and the North-West
Company is marked by a small monument.
That battle was part of a great struggle
between the early fur traders for the control
of the Northwest Territories.
I can name other sites that I think are of
historic importance, but my friend on my
left, the honourable senator from Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine), will say something to me
if I do. There is a site on the Portage
Highway, two miles west of Headingly, where
the first land surveyor of western Canada
started his chain; the land surveys of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British
Columbia started at that point. On the west
side of that is west of the first grade; on the
east side is east of the first grade. At first
it was the site of a monument, but within the
last two or three years the government has
seen fit to have a fence put around it and
pegged a garden.
I believe not only that the site should be
marked, but that the buildings should be
marked, if possible, or should be restored
without too much cost, so that their historical
association would be made known to people
who visit there. If some description and
identification of the buildings were given, and
perhaps an enclosure erected, it would become
of great interest to visitors. I do not believe

SENATE
that it is sufficient to have a monument bearing words such as, "This is where the battle
of Seven Oaks was iought." Lower Fu.,
Garry is still in existence; it has been kept
up by the Hudson's Bay Company, and has
been given to the government. I think it is
far more interesting in itself to visitors than
a monument could be.
I am glad to see that the bill provides for
a representative from each province. A distinguished prelate of the Roman Catholic
Church, in the city of St. Boniface, has been
Manitoba's representative on this board for
many years. He is a very able gentleman;
he has given very fine service to the province
of Manitoba in respect to the marking of historic sites, and has rendered this service
irrespective of all conditions. Just as a good
Manitoban would do, he has kept the right
perspective. I will not mention his name,
but anyone who knows Manitoba will know
of whom I speak.
I am glad to see the government sponsor
this legislation. I think it is a move in the
right direction. As my honourable friend
from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) said,
if we want to encourage tourists to visit this
country we must have some features of
interest to attract them.
A very large number of people visit the
parks in my province. Last year 389,000
visited Riding Mountain National Park. If
you want to see elk, well, there are plenty
of them there, as well as bufTalo and other
animals. Riding Mountain Park is very large,
and admirably suited for park purposes.
I heartily support the bill. I hope it will
be carried out in the spirit expressed by the
senator from Milford-Hants (Hon. Mr. Hawkins) and the senator from Medicine Hat (Hon.
Mr. Gershaw), and also by the senator from
Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan), who spoke
the other day on this subject in the debate
on tourist traffic.
I hope that Canada will some day have
numerous monuments and landmarks that will
attract tourists from abroad and from our
own country in ever increasing numbers.

Hon. W. Rupert Davies: Honourable senators, I also want to congratulate the senator
from Milford-Hants (Hon. Mr. Hawkins)
upon his explanation of the measure tonight.
As we have heard from New Brunswick and
Manitoba, I would like to say a word about
Ontario.
We have, of course, a number of historie
sites and monuments in Ontario. My purpose
in speaking tonight is to suggest to the
Historic Sites and Monuments Board that
consideration be given to the taking over
by the federal government of the care of
monuments which have been erected by municipalities and local societies. For instance,
there is in Victoria Park in the city of Brantford a very fine monument to the great Indian
chief Joseph Brant whose Indian name was
Thayendanegea. The Kent County Historic
Society put up a fine monument to the
memory of Chief Tecumseh. At a meeting
to commemorate the battle of 1812, members
of the Kent county society and some members of the Middlesex County Historie
Society gathered together at this monument.
While on a business trip through Western
Ontario last week I passed the monument and
was pleased to see how well it was kept.
In the city of Kingston we have a monument to Canada's first .prime minister, Sir
John A. Macdonald. In 1941, just fifty years
after Sir John died, a number of distinguished
statesmen from Ottawa attended a splendid
ceremony at his monument. I understand
that that monument and the one at Fort
Henry, just outside Kingston, were erected

CANADA WATER CONSERVATION
ASSISTANCE BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. F. W. Gershaw moved the second reading of Bill 109, an Act to authorize the grant
of assistance to a province for the conservation of water resources.
He said: Honourable senators, many
speeches have been made in this country
about the conservation of our national
resources. The brief bill now before us has
to do entirely with water resources. As we
all know, water is a great blessing when it
brings moisture to the thirsty land, or when
it is the source of power to run industry,
or to supply urban areas; but when it comes
in a roaring flood it can wreak destruction on
all that lies in its path.
Over a long period of time many major
structures have been erected and works
carried out by the dominion in co-operation
with the provinces. I might mention, for
example, the development under the Maritime Marshland Rehabilitation Act and the
building of the Fanshaw Dam on the Thames
river north of London; also the projects under
the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act; and the
work done under the Eastern Rocky Mountain Forest Conservation Act, which has
preserved the vegetable covering on the
eastern slope of the Rockies from being
destroyed by insects and fires and made it
possible for the streams to flow down the
mountain side in an orderly way.
The bill before us gives a statutory basis
for the erection by the dominion and any
province of a major structure suggested by
the province. Under the bill any federal
minister may, with the consent of the cabinet,
make an agreement with a province for the
conservation of its water resources. The
agreement shall prescribe the time, the location, the standards and methods of construction, and provide for the calling of tenders
and the extent to which the federal government will contribute. Provision is made for
constant inspection and the auditing of
accounts during the progress of the building
of a structure.
68112-29

The federal government will not contribute
more than 379 per cent of the total cost of
a major project, and in any event its subscription will not exceed that of the province
concerned. Part of the cost may be contributed by the local municipality.
The bill requires that the officers employed
on such projects must come under the Civil
Service Commission; also, that the minister
must lay before parliament annually a complete record of the progress made during the
previous year.
I would point out that this is not a new
method by which the federal government
would give assistance to provincial projects.
The bill merely puts a ceiling on the extent
to which the federal government is prepared
to share the cost with the provincial government.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I should like to ask the
honourable senator if he can give us some
examples of the type of project this bill is
intended to cover. I assume that it would
not include the dam on the South Saskatchewan river, near a place called Outlook, which
we have heard so much about.
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: The project to which
my honourable friend refers would require
special legislation. This bill would cover such
undertakings as the preservation of the vegetable covering on the eastern slope of the
Rocky Mountains, and the Fanshaw Dam on
the Thames river north of the city of London.
This measure is simply to give a statutory
basis for negotiation between the dominion
and provincial authorities on a major project,
towards which the federal government will
not contribute more than 37J per cent. Such
a structure as the honourable member refers
to would require special legislation and a
special distribution of costs.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, I
move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.
TRANS-CANADA

AIR LINES BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. G. P. Burchill moved the second reading of Bill 330, an Act to amend The TransCanada Air Lines Act, 1937.
He said: Honourable senators, one of the
things which struck me when I first enitered
parliament was the number of matters upon
which legislation can be based. After parliament had passed a long series of bills, I used
to think that so many projects had been
covered, there could not possibly be much
more legislation next session, but when I

SENATE
came back the following session it was
usually to fnr the order paper more extensive
than ever.
The bill before us affords some explanation of how this comes about. For when
legislation on one particular subject is adopted
it frequently makes necessary the introduction of other bills to cover a number of
matters which that legislation has indirectly
affected.
For example, in 1952 the budget resolution
included a provision which made it imperative thereafter that crown companies pay
income tax on their profits. That is the main
reason for the introduction of Bill 330. TransCanada Air Lines is a subsidiary of and
totally-owned by the Canadian National
Railways, which holds 200,000 shares of
Trans-Canada stock, of a value of $25,000,000,
upon which T.C.A. pays the C.N.R. 3 per
cent, or $750,000 a year. Upon the passage
of the budget resolution to which I referred,
Trans-Canada Airlines was immediately put
in the position of having to pay income tax,
because the $750,000 payment is, within the
meaning of the law, income. This bill, therefore, has been introduced to establish a new
capital structure of Trans-Canada Air Lines
so as to avoid payment of income tax: that
really is its object.
Of course, when amending legislation for
one special purpose is under consideration,
the law officers, upon a study of the then
existing act, frequently recommend quite a
number of other amendments to eliminate a
lot of deadwood in the shape of provisions
which by the lapse of time have become
unnecessary. Some sections of the act of
1937 are useless at the present time. As I
have said, Bill 330 deals with T.C.A. in its
new relationship to Canadian National Railways by virtue of the budget resolution to
which I referred.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Are we to understand
that when, pursuant to budget legislation,
crown companies are required to pay income
tax, there is to be special legislation so that
they can evade payment of income tax?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: That is exactly so, at
any rate in this case.
It will not take long to run through the
bill. Section 1 repeals a number of paragraphs in the act which today are not needed.
Section 2 increases from seven to nine the
number of directors of the new TransCanada Air Lines corporation. The object is
to make the directorate geographically more
Five directors are to be
representative.
elected by the shareholders of the corporation-that is, the Canadian National Rail-

ways-and the other four will be appointed
by the governor in council.
Section 3 gives the Canadlian Niationai Railways the authority to subscribe and purchase
the capital stock of the corporation, but
makes it necessary for them to have the
approval of parliament before selling or disposing of the shares. As I have indicated,
hitherto the C.N.R. have owned all the stock
of Trans-Canada Air Lines. It is now proposed that 200,000 shares, representing
$20,000,000, shall be surrendered by the Canadian National Railways; $5,000,000 worth of
stock will be retained; and in exchange for
the 200,000 shares surrendered, Trans-Canada Air Lines will issue a bond or other
security of the face value of $20,000,000
which will be held by the Canadian National
Railways, and upon which, of course, interest
will be payable. The term of the bond and
collateral matters will be settled by negotiation between the two corporations. Of course,
the interest so paid by Trans-Canada Air
Lines is not "income" within the meaning of
the Income Tax Act. Thereby, my honourable friend will see, income tax is evaded.
Hon. Mr. Aseline: A corporation which has
a deficit does not pay income tax, does it?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Trans-Canada Air Lines
has no deficit; it is making money.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: But the interest on this
bond is paid to the Canadian National Railways and becomes part of their income. As
they have a deficit, they will not have to pay
any income tax on it.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: That is correct.
Section 4 repeals section 9 of the act, which
enabled the company to sell shares to other
than the Canadian National Railways. I
believe that when the act was passed it was
felt that some people in the country would
be sufficiently interested in aviation to purchase some shares of T.C.A., but that has not
been the case. No one has been anxious to
buy these shares, and so this provision is
being eliminated and the Canadian National
Railway Company will become the sole
owner.
Section 5 of the bill provides that, as this
corporation now is fully owned by the C.N.R.,
the auditor of the C.N.R. is appointed to
audit the account of the Trans-Canada Air
Lines.
I believe that heretofore TransCanada Air Lines could appoint its own auditor, but this is now to be the function of the
auditor of the Canadian National Railway
Company, who is, of course appointed by
parliament.
Section 6 gives T.C.A. the power to maintain and operate hangars, landing fields, and

APRIL 21, 1953
so on, which is an authority it has not got
under the provisions of the present act.
Section 6 also deletes the words "mooring
masts" which appear in the present act.
Mooring masts are things of the past and are
no longer required to be provided for in the
act. Section 6 of the bill also gives the corporation power to borrow money for capital
expenditures from the Canadian National
Railway Company which, in turn will come
to parliament if necessary.
Other subsections of section 6 have been
added to increase the powers of the corporation. They provide for the lending of money
to the C.N.R., the issuing of bonds and notes,
the operation of motor vehicles for the purpose of transporting passengers back and
forth to airports, and the operation of hotels,
if this is deemed expedient for the purpose
of taking care of passengers awaiting
transportation.
Section 6 (2)(k) provides for the appropriation of the words "Air Canada"-which is a
translation into French of "Trans-Canada"as a trade name for any purpose connected
with the business of the corporation.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I interrupt to ask the
honourable senator a question? I notice that
section 6 (2)(j) reads:
To purchase, lease, or otherwise acquire or pro-

vide, hold, use, enjoy and operate such hotels in
Canada as are deemed expedient for the purposes
of the corporation.

Is there any necessity for giving this corporation the power to purchase, lease, hold,
use, enjoy and operate hotels in Canada?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I am told that in some
places where delays in the service have
occurred it has been necessary for TransCanada Air Lines to find overnight accommodation for its passengers. I believe that
is the reason for this provision in the bill.
Under the present act the corporation is
not allowed to sell or dispose of more than
49 per cent of its outstanding shares without
the approval of parliament. Section 6 of the
bill provides that the corporation will not
be allowed to sell or dispose of any of its
outstanding shares except with the approval
of parliament.
Under section 7 no subsidy is to be paid
Trans-Canada Air Lines, but in the event of
a loss in operation, or, for capital purposes,
the necessary funds are to be procured from
the Canadian National Railway Company
which, in turn, of course, comes to parliament
for the necessary financing.
Hon. Mr. King: If it needs the money.
68112-291

Hon. Mr. Burchill: Section 8 simply
provides that the number of petitioners for
the incorporation of any subsidiary corporation which Trans-Canada Air Lines might
wish to create must not exceed nine. This
is in line with the increased number of directors. At present the number of petitioners
must not exceed seven.
Section 9 grants authority for changing the
capital structure of the company. I believe
I have already dealt fully with this section.
Part II of the bill simply makes corresponding amendments to the new Revised Statutes
of Canada which are now in the press, in
order to bring them in line with this legislation.
Part III of the bill provides for the extinction of Trans-Canada Air Lines, Atlantic
Limited. In other words, from now on the
Atlantic division will be included in the main
corporation, Trans-Canada Air Lines Limited.
Honourable senators, that concludes my
explanation of this bill.
Hon. Mr. Farris: May I ask the honourable
senator why parliament should empower this
corporation to avoid taxation?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I cannot answer that
question.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Perhaps the mover can
answer an easier question. Can he explain
why Trans-Canada Air Lines, which shows a
good report each year, should not place its
shares on the market when the Canadian
National Railway Company, which shows
deficits from time to time, is permitted to
place its shares on the market?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I can only reply that I
have been informed by officials of the department that this legislation is the result of much
study and negotiation. There have been two
schools of thought. One view was that TransCanada Air Lines should be independent and
on its own; but the second view, which prevailed, was that it would be better to link it
with the Canadian National Railway Company and make it a totally-owned subsidiary
of the C.N.R. That was the considered judgment of those who are supposed to know.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

as to undertake the kind of action recomHonourable senators, the only point I will mended, we would be ill-equipped to carry
raise is whether the Senate, by attempting it on intelligently. Take this particular item,
to reduce the rate of taxation, the incidence honourable senators. I assume that the idea

Il of this act shall be deemed to have come into

of the proponents of this action is to save
The
margarine consumers $2k million.
immediate method adopted is to reduce tne
tax that margarine manufacturers have to
pay by that amount, in the hope that they
would reduce the price accordingly and keep
it reduced. But how we could know whether
they did so and continued to do so, is beyond
me. I am sure no one would want this
change made in the schedule merely to
increase the profits of the margarine manufacturers. Yet, in this particular case, at
least, there is no competition, for the importation of margarine is prohibited-a hangover, I suppose, from the days when it was
illegal also to sell or manufacture margarine
in Canada.
Honourable senators, the further one goes
into this matter the more complicated it
becomes, and the more ill-advised it appears
to be for us to set ourselves up as
budgeteers.
I invoke no precedent. I invoke only the
rule of ordinary common sense; and I ask you,
honourable senators, to vote against this
amendment of the Banking and Commerce
Committee.
The Chairman: Are you ready for the
question?
An Hon. Senalor: Question.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators,
I had hoped when the matter was referred
to the Committee of the Whole that there
would be a little more discussion than we
have had, in view of the fact that the amendment was carried in the Banking and Commerce Committee by a very substantial
majority, and I am sure that the members
of the committee voted on the merits of the
questions which have been discussed here.
I hoped that similar action would be taken
by the Senate itself in Committee of the
Whole. But I have been in politics quite a
long time, and I know that you cannot always
believe what you think you see on the surface.
I realize that although the committee carried
the amendment by a large majority, it does
not necessarily follow that four or five days
later the amendment will be carried in the
Senate. There is no need to enlarge upon
that.
I am not going to discuss the merits of
margarine. My views on margarine in all
its aspects are so well known that I think
it would probably be out of place for me
to repeat them here now. We are not discussing the merits of margarine; we are
merely discussing the sales tax of 10 per
cent on margarine. But, as I sponsored the
amendment before the Banking and Commerce Committee perhaps I should state the
reasons why I did so. I had no intention of

embarrassing the government. I merely considered the question on its merits. If you will
look at schedule III, tw
th leader of
the government has referred, and from which
he said the names of a great many foods
were omitted, you will find that practically
all foods, with the one exception of margarine,
are exempt from the 10 per cent sales tax. I
would like the leader to give me, if he would,
the names of any substantial foods that are
subject to the sales tax.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Shall I read them to
my honourable friend? I prefaced my remarks
by saying that a large number of items, more
than five hundred, were still subject to sales
tax. I said that as respects the extent of
use or consumption they could not begin to
compare to many other items, including margarine. I tried to make that perfectly clear.
I mentioned a few of them by way of illustration, and will read thern again. I have not a
complete list of the more than five hundred
items that are still taxable, and if I had I
would not attempt to read it; but among those
items are the following:
Olives, onion powder, onion salt, Ovaltine, Oxo
cubes, almond paste, rota peas, pepper, popcorn,
pie filler, sauces, sausage binders, soya beans. soya
bean paste, spreads (sandwich), spices, tomato
sauce, catsup, vinegar, Vitone, vanilla extract, mint,
mix of skim milk powder, mustard seed oil, nuts,
pancake batter, pectin, pie thickener, rape seed oil,
rice paste.

As I said at the beginning of my remarks,
as far as extent of use or consumption is
concerned, these items are not in the category
of margarine or certain other foods. The
distinction is quite broad. It looked to me
as if these were largely items which are not
produced in Canada but are imported. I do
not know whether that is so or not; I have
not had time to inquire.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: How much would the
tax amount to on all of them?
Hon. Mr. Roberison: I have not any idea.
I suggested that they are not the foods most
extensively used. I was not arguing; my
point was just that margarine is not the only
food subject to the sales tax.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I thank the leader for the
list. Anyone who listened carefully to it
must have come to the same conclusion as I
did, that these items are not foods in the
ordinary sense of the term, but are more in
the nature of luxuries, whether they are
imported or not. I would like to read a few
of the items that come under the Schedule III,
which exempts several hundred items from
sales tax. They are grouped. The first group,
probably because it is the most important, is
"Foodstuffs". The exemption of foodstuffs
from the tax is, as was stated voluntarily in
the committee last week by a representative

APRIL 22, 1953
of the department, for the purpose of reducing
the cost of living; and I contend that in the
cost of living foodstuffs is one of the largest
factors.
May I be permitted to read a few of the
exempted foods, some of which come close to
being luxuries. The list reads in part:
Bread, butter, cheese, cream, eggs, egg albumen,
egg yolks, honey, ice,-

I suppose that is necessary for the preservation of food. The list continues:
Lard, rice, salt, shortening, soups, sugar, cereal
breakfast foods, cooking oil, fish; flour including
pastry, cake, biscuit and similar mixes; foods prepared and sold exclusively for feeding infants;
fruit, fresh, canned, frozen, preserved, dried or
evaporated; grain grits and meals; ice cream-

And that I admit is a food.
Jams, jellies, marmalades, and preserves-

Some of these are close to being in the
luxury line, but nevertheless they are in the
list. Continuing:
Malt syrup, maple syrup, corn syrup, table syrups,
molasses; meats and poultry, fresh, cooked, etc.,
peanut butter, vegetable juices, and so on.

I venture to say that in the list read by the
leader there was not a food mentioned which
compares with any of these I have enumerated. My point is that as a general principle,
and with a view to reducing the cost of
living, foods generally, with the exception of
margarine, have been made exempt from the
10 per cent sales tax. It might be argued
even now by a few that margarine is not a
food. But I submit that after millions of
Canadians have tried margarine and found it
good, there is hardly anyone in Canada who
will deny that it is a food.
Why was margarine originally omitted from
this list of exempted foods? The charitable
explanation for its omission is that when the
list of foods was prepared there was no such
thing as margarine in Canada. Therefore, it
could not have been included in the list of
tax-exempt foods. But why, when margarine did become a legal food in this country,
was it not added to the list?

I think every-

body knows the answer to that question.
If the principle of reducing the cost of
living by exempting foods from sales tax is
sound, there can be no excuse for omitting one
staple article of food in this country. There
should be no discrimination.
One of the reasons given why this amendment to exempt margarine should not be carried is that it would reduce the federal
revenue. Whether the inclusion of margarine
would deprive the government of $2 million
or $24 million is not, to my way of thinking,
an argument against the committee's amendment. If the loss of revenue were a good
argument, there are hundreds of items in this

list which have no more right to inclusion
than has margarine. It is not a very strong
argument.
It was argued that adoption of the committee's amendment would lead to the placing of
increased powers in the hands of the Senate,
and that it would become a budget-making
body. I submit that that is a very far-fetched
argument, if it is an argument at all. No one
will for one moment contend that the Senate
would try to revise every budget. What other
means than the one taken by the committee
have we for rectifying what, in my charitable
frame of mind today, I may call an oversight
on the part of the government?
If we are to accept the further argument of
the leader-and I do not want to misquote
him-that the Senate should never initiate
anything that has to do with taxation or
revenue, then the Senate in effect becomes
merely an echo of the House of Commons. I
for one object to being put in that position.
The leader spoke of the possibility of the
manufacturers of margarine taking an extra
profit through the exemption from sales tax
and not passing it on to the consumers; and
he added the rather amazing observation that
there was no competition in this particular
manufacturing field. Let me say that there
are a dozen manufacturers of margarine in
this country. I can well imagine that unless
a combine exists amongst the manufacturers
-and the present government is strongly
against such practices-a reduction of two or
three cents, a pound would make a great difference in this competitive business. If the
cost of the product is reduced by the removal
of the application of the 10 per cent sales tax,
a reduction in cost to the consumer will automatically follow.
I had rather expected to hear the real argument against margarine.
Hon. Mr. Reid: They all know it.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The real argument, I am
frank to say, is that the producers of butter
do not want competition from margarine. The
butter producers were strongly against the
proposal to legalize margarine in Canada. I,
as you know, had something to do with that
contest. I should like to pay a compliment to
the leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig), who said
in committee that he felt he had been mistaken in his earlier attitude against margarine,
and now supported this amendment of the
committee.
It has been argued that as farmers and
dairymen have been discriminated against
by reason of the fact that manufacturers
generally have tariff protection, farmers and
dairymen should be given some protection
through being enabled to produce butter

SENATE
free of competition. I can see some reasonableness behind the argument for protection
against the products of a foreign country,
and I can understand why in many instances
Canadian producers request protection. But
here we are asked to give protection for one
Canadian industry against another Canadian industry. We call Canada a democratic
country, and pride ourselves upon encouraging private enterprise and individualism. Are
we to deny these principles by legislating
in behalf of one industry against another. If
that is our policy, where will it end?
My good friend the senator from Blaine
Lake Hon. Mr. Horner) raises horses. Upon
the principles of those who oppose the
amendment, I suppose he might have protested
against the introduction of automobiles and
trucks or, more recently, the transport plane.
Probably nowadays he uses mechanical transport on his own farm. These changes are a
part of the march of progress, and they
cannot be successfully resisted. In my city
are two large tanneries, which are very well
conducted, but there, as in other parts of
Canada, tanners are-to use a common
expression-"finding the going very tough".
Why? To a large extent, because of substitutes for leather. Leatherette has been on
the market for some time, and of late years
neolite has come into very general use for
making soles of shoes. In other fields, plastics
are taking the place of wood, steel and iron.
My friend from Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt) is a producer of maple syrup, and
very good maple syrup it is: I thank him for
including me in the number of those to whom
he makes a contribution of this product.
I am sure he is too broadminded to contemplate for a moment applying to the
government of which he is a supporter for
legislation against the production of honey,
or corn syrupHon. Mr. Haig: Or sugar.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Or jams, jellies, marmalades and other possible substitutes for maple
syrup. I believe he is ready to take his
chances in competition with these things. All
I am asking is that an article of food which
may be-indeed, is-in competition with
butter shall be put on the same basis as allI use the word "all" advisedly-other articles
of food; that is, all foods consumed in substantial quantities.
I do not take seriously the argument as
to a potential loss of revenue. It would apply
to any other article for which exemption is
proposed. If exemption is to be refused
because one or two million dollars would
thereby be lost to the national revenue, why
single out margarine? Why should not maple

syrup or items in one of the other classifications be taxed? I notice, for instance, that
both sawdust and wooden shavngs are
exempted from sales tax. The exclusion of
margarine is a discriminatory act, and to my
mind there is only one reason for it. It is
not a matter of revenue; it is nothing but
the desire to obstruct the competition of
margarine with the somewhat similar commodity known as butter.
I had not intended to speak at this length,
but perhaps I may briefly reiterate the points
I have tried to make. It is very strange that
in a country of free enterprise, federal and
provincial governments support protection
of one commodity to the prejudice of another
like product of our own country. I say both
federal and provincial governments, because
I want to point out, if I am not out of order,
that some provincial governments persist in
their refusal to permit the colouring of margarine; and the federal.government, through
the imposition of the sales tax, operates to
the same effect.
To sum up what I have said-perhaps not
very well, because I had not expected the
line of argument, if such it can be termed,
of
the
government
leader
(Hon.
Mr.
Robertson)-I would urge the Senate to
accept the committee's amendment for these
three reasons:
First: margarine is a food, and should not
be an object of discrimination in relation to
other foods.
Second: the removal of the tax would provide soie relief from the high cost of living,
which is the purpose of exemptions from
sales fax.
Third: -- nd I think this is the most important reason of all-margarine, in spite of such
obstacles as total prohibition, later removed,
sales tax, and the ban on colouring, is
favoured by the vast majority of Canadian
consumers. This fact has been demonstrated
over and over again in different parts of the
country by plebiscites and other tests of
public opinion. To exempt margarine from
sales tax is, I submit, not only morally right,
but in the long run would prove politically
expedient as well.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I have listened with great pleasure to the
statement made by the leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson). I know that
the legality of the committee's amendment
can be argued pro and con, and it is not my
intention to discuss it at this stage.
For the first time since I entered this
chamber I find myself at the crossroads,
because our decision, if my judgment is correct, may have far-reaching effects upon the

APRIL 22. 1953
position of this body. Sooner or later-it
may be ten years hence, it may be only six
months-a government of another political
persuasion, to which nearly 100 per cent of
the present membership of this chamber are
opposed politically, may be sitting in the
other place. If the proposed policy is followed
a struggle between both houses of parliament
will be inevitable.
While I am highly honoured in being a
member of this chamber, I have always
realized that in the case of a showdown the
elected representatives of parliament would
ultimately win out over the appointed members.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I agree.
Hon. Mr. Haig: There is no doubt about that
at all, and no one should think otherwise. I
wanted to make this remark to clear the
air before indicating my position on this
measure. I would remind honourable senators that on three previous occasions I have
voted against legislation favouring margarine.
However, I said quite candidly in committee
the other day that I had reached the stage
where I am ready to vote in favour of
margarine. Let me tell you why. I started
out in public life on January 1, 1908, and have
never been out of it since. I have served as
a member of a school board, a provincial
legislature, and this bouse. Like anybody
else, I started my public career with certain
ideas. Now, we people in the public life of
this country must try to keep Canada to the
forefront among the progressive countries of
the world, and this cannot be done unless we
realize that some of the policies we adopted
early in life are not suitable to present
conditions.
I have great admiration for the ability
and sagacity of the honourable senator from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler), and for his outstanding services to Canada. He has certainly
brought great credit to the Senate. The
honourable gentleman stated this afternoon
his reasons for believing that margarine should
be included on the list of foodstuffs exempt
from the imposition of sales tax. Personally,
I think we have reached the time when we
must recognize margarine as a food that is
used by the majority of Canadians every day,
and I challenge anyone to deny that it is.
This would not be an issue at all if there
were as many valuable votes in the cities
as there are in the rural parts of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: About a year and a half ago
95 per cent of the people of my city of Winnipeg voted in favour of having margarine
coloured. However, the provincial government refused to allow this. Later on the
68112-30

same government asked for support on a
hydro-electric policy, but remembering that
this government had voted against colouring
margarine the people of Winnipeg voted
against the hydro-electric policy.
My honourable friend from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner) represents a farming community, and I give him credit for it. He is
perfectly within his rights in voting agâinst
the committee's amendment if he is convinced
that it is in the best interests of the farmers
of Canada to do so. I would point out, however, that one-third of the people of my province live in the district which I represent,
and I know that the majority of them use
margarine. With the present high cost of
living there is no doubt that the labouring
class can better afford margarine than butter.
It is the working men and women of this
country who make Canada what it is, and the
minute we forget this fact we lose our right
to speak as democrats. The leader of the
government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) has warned
that if the committee's amendment passes, any
future government will be confronted with the
fact that a hostile Senate could keep introducing amendments to its budget legislation
which would make government administration practically impossible. I am persuaded,
however, that there is no practical danger in
this.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The Senate could do that
now, if it wanted to.
Hon. Mr. Haig: There are two legislative
houses in Quebec, and at the present time the
majority of the members of the second
chamber are opposed to the government. On
an election bill the other day the opposition
in the legislative assembly voted solidly
against the government.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: No, they voted against
an amendment.
Hon. Mr. Haig: All the Liberals in the
Assembly voted against the government.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: You are referring to the
Lower House.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes. There is the Legislative
Council and the Legislative Assembly, and I
am referring to the Legislative Assembly. The
members of that chamber voted approximately 68 to 21 for the proposed legislation.
Al the Liberals voted against it, and the government supporters were for it. Some of the
politically appointed opponents of the government in the Legislative Council voted against
the measure, but it was eventually passed.
Under similar circumstances the Senate would
be compelled to act in the same way. Honourable senators could get up and say why they
opposed a certain measure, but ultimately the

SENATE
house would have to vote in accordance with
what the majority of the people in this
uuuin±ay w anted. Make no mistake about it;
that is what would happen.
I am not particularly anxious to have the
committee's amendment passed, for I do not
think it will make much difference, but if it is
pressed to a vote I feel that as a representative of the people of my part of Canada I
should vote for it. I realize now that the
people of this country want margarine because
it is cheaper than butter. One of our leading
newspapers conducted a survey among the
rural stores and discovered' that nearly 50 per
cent of the people in those areas were buying
margarine. Even the people in the premier's
constituency are buying more margarine than
butter. We cannot get away from these facts
no matter how much we may dislike to accept
them. Personally, I would rather eat butter.
I tried margarine only once, and I was
unaware that I was doing so at the time. My
wife told me afterwards that she had put
margarine on the table. She said I had not
complained about it, but I remarked "Well, I
wish you wouldn't do that again".
Honourable senators, I think this house will
vote for the amendment proposed by the
leader of the government, and I know that all
my friends here from Saskatchewan oppose
the stand I am taking. That is their right. I
do not know what stand the honourable senators from the Maritimes will take, but I imagine that those who come from cities hold the
same view as I do.
I shall vote for the committee's amendment. True, some farmers in my province
have not been in favour of the amendment,
but I cannot understand why. The 10 per
cent tax on oleomargarine adds about 3, to
4 cents per pound to the price.
Hon. Mr. Euler: About 2 cents.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, about 21 cents
which makes it about 421 cents instead
of 40 cents per pound. Why the dairymen
should fear that competition, I do not know.
The fight against the use of margarine has
caused more people to eat margarine than
ever before. Many people have said to me,
"Well, Mr. Haig, I didn't think much about
margarine until I heard so much talk about
it and read so much about it in the papers.
In our home we tried it out, and we didn't
find any difference between it and butter;
and in fact now we like it." I think the
present discussion will have the same effect.
I did not know this amendment was going
to be made in the Banking committee. I
made up my mind about margarine within
the last six or eight months, and I have been
drifting over to the point of view that I

should not stand in the way of what I considered to be progress any longer, and that it
-vas my duty to zay sE, representing asI dn
the province of Manitoba, and particularly my
own city. I felt, therefore, that I should
vote for the use of margarine at the first
opportunity.
I congratulate the leader of the government
on his efforts. I think he used sound judgment in taking the issue away from the questioin of :whether or not the committee's
amendment is in order. I must say that I
think it is, but whether it is or not, that
is not the real issue. The real issue here is
whether we recognize oleomargarine as a
food or not. If we recognize margarine as
a food, we should put it on the free list of
foodstuffs. If we do not so recognize it, we
should vote against the committee's amendment. That is the whole point.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: Would the honourable
senator permit a question please?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: I understood him to say
that he did not think it would make any
difference whether we adopted the committee's amendment or not.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I mean as far as the public
is concerned, because they will go on buying
margarine just the same. The committee's
amendment would make it 2é cents a pound
cheaper.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I had not intended to say anything on this
occasion, but I think my leader has gone
entirely too far. We all know that if it were
not for the farmers Canada would not be
what it is today; there would not be any
cities, and particularly, may I say, the city
of Winnipeg. It is the wealth produced by
the farmer that maintains that city, as is
evidenced by the large shipments of grain
and truckloads 'of livestock that go there.
Hon. Mr. Haig: What would you do without
Winnipeg?
Hon. Mr. Horner: It has become a great
manufacturing centre, and the manufacturer
is well protected.
Now, I will be quite frank. When he
introduced this margarine question the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) said-and I remember his argument,
as no doubt others do-that there was an
opportunity for the government to get a
revenue from it. Now he wants to take the
revenue away from the government.
Hon. Mr. Euler: No, I must protest.
Hon. Mr. Horner: My memory is very good,
and that is my recollection.

APRIL 22. 1953
Hon. Mr. Euler: In what form would it get
'the revenue?
Hon. Mr. Horner: In the same way that it
is getting it now.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I was always against the
tax.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I am quite frank to admit,
as I said in the committee, that margarine can
be sold. There are 250,000 people keeping
milch cows in this country, many of them
raising their familles from the proceeds. Now,
the margarine manfacturer and the packers
are not using a lot of waste fats that are
available, but they will throw in a dead
pig, or beaver or bear, to get the fat. And
they will work three days a week, or one
day a week, or two months a year. But the
dairy farmer works a twelve-hour day, fiftytwo weeks of the year-Sunday, Monday and
every other day. Margarine can be sold at
a much lower price than butter, and the
sales tax does not prevent the men in the
cities, who are earning good money, from
purchasing margarine. The leader of the
government estimated that the tax yielded a
revenue of $24 million, but I think he put it
at a low figure. My estimate would be
$5 million.
Here is another point. Experts who are
engaged in research in the State of Minnesota
have been testing the vegetable oils that constitute the ingredients of margarine. They
have experimented by feeding 100 calves on
milk and cream, and another 100 calves on
the ingredients of margarine. The mortality
rate has been much higher among the calves
fed exclusively on the products that enter
into the making of margarine, and the experts
are pretty well convinced at this stage that
margarine lacks something that butter contains. I am firmly of that opinion myself.
We all pay income tax and other taxes, and
we realize the government must have
revenue to carry on, but we must also realize
that not 15 per cent of the products entering
into margarine originate in Canada. More
than 85 per cent are imported into this
country.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: What about the bears?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Well-shoot them and put
them in the fat.
I am quite frank in saying that I hope
the interests of the dairy farmer will not be
prejudiced.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask my honourable friend a question? He said there are
some 250,000 dairy farmers in Canada. What
has he to say about the accumulated supplies
of powdered milk, as reported in the newspapers? If such a surplus quantity of
68112-301

powdered milk has accumulated in warehouses that a government agency has to sell
it at a sacrifice, why does not the dairy
industry divert its milk products to something else?
orner: To what else can they
Hon. Mr.
divert their milk products, may I ask. It
seems to me that your question only
strengthens my argument.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The farmers could
divert their attention from powdered milk
to butter.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Canadian farmers will
produce sufficient butter to meet our needs
if the price is right. In Winnipeg and other
cities the people have been used to getting
butter that was produced by slave labour
on the farm. In spite of the fact that every
article the farmer buys has gone up by three
times its former price, consumers still expect
to buy butter at the price they bought it
when everything else was down. I repeat, if
we are paid an adequate price, we can meet
the butter needs in Canada.
True, there is a sufficient supply of
powdered milk. The reason for that is that
there was once a great demand for it, and
now because of tariff duties and other things
the demand has fallen off and it has become
a drug on the market.
Hon. W. A. Fraser: Honourable senators,
I should like to make a few observations.
Before doing so may I compliment the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) upon his splendid submission in support of the committee's amendment. I listened attentively to the more or less
emotional presentation by the honourable
leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) as he
expressed agreement on this occasion with
the contentions of the senator from Waterloo.
May I deal first with one or two points in
which I am in absolute disagreement with
the senator from Waterloo.
In the first place we all agree that margarine is a food. But there are two sides to
every question. Those persons who have been
interested in the sale of margarine over the
past few years have been successful in getting its manufacture and distribution legalized in Canada. With that I do not think
anybody quarrels. But surely there is a point
at which we should consider whether the
manufacture and sale of margarine amount
to unfair competition with our dairy products.
It must be remembered that one of the
important factors in this question is that
oleomargarine is a mechanically manufactured product, made from raw materials

SENATE
imported into Canada in most cases free of
duty. In other words, on one side there is a
mechanically manufactured product, the components of which come in duty free, and on
the other side there is butter being produced
on our own Canadian farms.
I am one who believes in a free economy:
I am in favour of the removal of obstructions and barriers to trade wherever possible.
Knowing the attitude of the honourable leader
opposite on the matter of protection in other
lines, I was somewhat surprised at his present
attitude towards oleomargarine. I cannot say
I was moved to tears when he discussed the
need for lowering the cost of food for the
working people in the great metropolis.
I was very pleased to hear the remarks of
my honourable friend who just resumed his
seat (Hon. Mr. Horner) as to the economy
of the dairy farmer. And I should like to
say to my honourable friends that the present
general prosperity in the Dominion of Canada reflects the prosperity of the rural areas
more than the prosperity of the urban centres.
As was said a few minutes ago, let us not
forget that the soimdness of the economy of
Canada is affiliated with the dairy cow. Our
economy is supported by the products of the
soil, the sea and the forest, rather than by
the forty-hour-a-week man in the metropolitan centres who enjoys the protection
given to labour. But nobody objects for a
moment to the protection given to labour. I
am only pointing out that the farmer who
buys bis supplies and machinery on a highly
protected market and who has to pay union
wages is the least protected man in Canada.
As the honourable senator from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner) has just stated, the farmer
does not work a four or five-day week, but
a seven-day week.
The question before the chamber today is
not that presented by the honourable senater from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler), namely,
whether oleomargarine is or is not a food.
We must not lose sight of the fact that
two Canadian provinces have prohibited the
manufacture and sale of margarine. There
must be some good reason for their action.
On the question of low-cost food, let us not
forget that the sales tax on oleomargarine
amounts to only about 21 cents a pound. It
is not true, as has been argued, that all other
foodstuffs are free from taxation. For instance,
we import fruits, vegetables and nuts from
the United States on which we pay duty.
There arc some people who contend that a
bottle of Coca-Cola is a food. Indeed, to
some of us a bottle of cold beer is a food.
It is not a question of what is and what is not
a food, but what constitutes fair competition.

Oleomargarine is, as I have said, a mechanically manufactured product in competition
with the naiuai poducts cf thc dairy
farmers.
My friend the senator from Waterloo made
the statement that this chamber must not
become an echo of the House of Commons.
In that I heartily agree. But I have a right
to stand in my place in the Senate and
speak of things as I sec them; and it is not
a sign of weakness, as my honourable friend
would have us believe, if I fall in line with
certain views of the other house.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I did not say that.
Hon. Mr. Fraser: That is my understanding
of what you said.
Hon. Mr. Euler: It was exactly the opposite.
I said that every man should discuss each
question on its merits and not do what
somebody else tells him to do.
Hon. Mr. Fraser: Very well. I will accept
the correction, but what I said still goesSome

Hon. Senators:

Oh, oh!

Hon. Mr. Euler: Where does it go?
Hon. Mr. Fraser: -that I have a right to
express my views here in the Senate.
My honourable friend mentioned maple
syrup as being protected against substitutes
from the United States.
Hon. Mr. Euler: But it is not protected
against competition.
Hon. Mr. Fraser: It is protected against
competition from substitutes. If honourable
senators will look carefully at the list in
Schedule III they will sec that these items
wvhich are free from sales tax are the products
of our Canadian farms.

An Hon. Senator: No.
Hon. Mr. Fraser: What about apple juice?
Anyway, I say that 98 per cent of these
items are products of Canadian farms. Margarine is not one of our farm products.
In conclusion, the question as I sec it is
not whether margarine is a food-we know
that it is-but what will be the effect of its
manufacture and sale upon one of our most
important industries. The sales tax on margarine at least gives the producer of dairy
products an advantage of 2, cents per pound

APRIL 22. 1953
over his competitor, who is the manufacturer
of a mechanically-produced article.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Does not my friend think
that that of itself is an argument against permitting the production of margarine at all?
Hon. Mr. Fraser: I am not opposed to the
production of oleornargarine.. But it is a lowcost product which competes with butter; and
I believe that if the committee's amendment
is carried the result will be detrimental to the
production of one of our national farm products. It will favour an article produced by
controlled labour through a mechanical
process, to the prejudice of the dairyman,
whose labour is unprotected and who is
subject to the high cost of the products of
protected urban industries. Besides, the prosperity of this country is such that if, as has
been said this afternoon, oleomargarine is so
popular in Winnipeg, the people of that city
can afford to buy it, with or without sales tax.
Knowing something about the dairy industry,
living amongst farmers, and being not
unacquainted with life in the urban centres,
I submit, contrary to the views of the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig), that the
amendment should be defeated. I hope it will
be defeated.
Hon. W. Rupert Davies: Honourable senators, I shall be very brief. I believe that when
a member of this honourable Senate changes
his mind and votes contrary to the way he
voted before, he should explain why; and
because I find I cannot vote for the committee's amendment, I want to place myself on
record in this matter and explain why my
attitude has changed. I do not wish to be
regarded as one who jumps here, there, and
all over the place, moved by every wind that
blows.
For several reasons I cannot vote for the
committee's amendment. On every occasion
upon which the matter has come before the
house, I have supported both the importation
and the manufacture of margarine. But, in
my opinion, at this moment we have gone far
enough. From figures which have reached me
I find that since margarine has been manufactured and sold in Canada-every province,
I believe, except Quebec, which barred itthe consumption of butter in this country has
very seriously decreased. It seems to me that
enough harm has been done to the dairy
industry, and at the present time I cannot vote
to add to the difficulties of both our farmers
and our dairymen.
Further, I am not at all sure that any benefits following the abolition of the sales tax
would be passed on to the consumer. We in
the newspaper business have had a rather sad
experience since the budget came down. I
must apologize for not having been here and

in attendance at the committee last week,
because probably I would then have been in a
better position to speak on the subject; but I
was attending a newspaper convention at
Toronto; a very distinguished journalist flew
over from London to speak to us, and I
thought it my duty to be there. For some
years the sales tax on newsprint stood at 10
per cent. This was a very sore point with the
newspaper publishers: they felt it should not
be there, and presented their views on a number of occasions before officials of the
Department of Finance. Then the tax was
removed, and we anticipated relief in approximately the amount of the tax. But what
happened?
Within a week the newsprint
manufacturers raised by ten dollars a ton the
price of newsprint and entirely nullified all
the benefit the publishers got from the
removal of the tax.
As I said, I am supporting this amendment
because I feel we have done the dairy industry
harm-and, I think, enough harm. It must
not be forgotten that since margarine was
introduced into this country business has been
very prosperous. That condition resulted in
several increases of wages. At the present
time the income of most urban workers is
much higher than it was three or four years
ago, and I think these people are quite able to
pay without serious difficulty a sales tax of
2à cents a pound, or whatever it is.
My main reason, however, for not being
able to vote for this amendment is that, having given the subject a good deal of thought,
I cannot bring myself to feel that this appointed body should interfere with the taxation
of this country. It is, I believe, a question to
be dealt with by the elected representatives
of the people. I have made this explanation
because I shall have to vote against the committee's amendment.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
before the vote is taken I want to place on
record my stand on this very important matter, especially because on other occasions
I have not always supported the views of the
honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler). I feel that, apart from all that has
been said, there is a principle at stake here.
I am not unaware of the great difficulties
facing the farming population. As a matter
of fact, I think I have milked as many cows
as has any honourable senator in this
chamber.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I doubt that.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I live in a farming community, but I would not argue the point
about milking cows with my friend from
Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner).
If the
question before us had been raised just after
an election perhaps it would not have been

SENATE
so serious a matter with some honourable

The leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) spoke about the question of margarine being a food. I wonder if those who
do not accept margarine as a food would go
down to Newfoundland and tell this to the
people of that island province? Newfoundlanders have been eating margarine for
years, and from what I have seen of them
I know they are good, sturdy people.
Let us clear the decks and find out just
what this question involves. And may I
give a word of advice to the farmers of this
country, and state why I have decided to
vote against the amendment of the honourable leader of the government. Incidentally,
the honourable member from Trenton (Hon.
Mr. Fraser) said he would vote against the
amendment, when in fact I believe he is in
favour of it. The amendment now before
the bouse is that the recommendation of the
committee be not approved. Now to come
to my point: I observe that ice cream is listed
as a foodstuff which is exempt from the sales
tax. Do my honourable friends know that
synthetic ice cream is now being manufactured in competition with ice cream produced
from cows' milk? I was amazed to discover
that in the province of Ontario certain manufacturers are using a filler product from
wood pulp to produce ice cream. People
think that all ice cream is made from a product that comes from the cow. The bill
before us exempts many foods from the sales
tax-including, as I say, ice cream-yet some
honourable senators will argue that there
should be a sales tax on margarine. We must
not overlook the fact that 50 per cent of the
farmers are now using margarine. The very
men who clamour on the hustings that margarine should be banned are themselves selling butter and buying margarine for their
own tables. And I understand that in the
province of Saskatchewan a co-operative
association is actually making margarine.
Let us look at this question in its proper
light. Margarine has always been accepted
as a food in Newfoundland. There can be
no disputing the fact that it is a food, and
if it is a food why should it not be exempt
from the sales tax along with these other
foodstuffs listed in Schedule III of the bill?
I should like to refer honourable senators
to an article I have here. I do not intend
to read it all, but for the benefit of those who
come from the extensive dairy-farming communities of Canada I would point out that
the manager of a large dairy association in
my province urges that the farmers had
better become modernized. He says that
they are not acting wisely in putting all

their emphasis on butter fat and neglecting
the milk that is left from butter fat. I am
not going to go into this argument, but the
writer places the matter before the farmers
and tells them that it is time they bring
themselves up to date and become reconciled
to modern conditions. He says that they
should accept margarine and compete against
it with all the vitamins and minerals contained in milk, and that they should stress
the production of milk rather than butter
fat. That is the latest advice being given
to the farmers in my province. Bear in mind
that milk is now being manufactured in the
United States from synthetic articles which
have no relation at all to our good and wholesome cows. And I suppose these products
will soon be sold in Canadian stores.
I wish to go on record as voting against
the amendment of the leader of the government because of the principle at stake here.
Once again I want to say I am not unmindful of the problems confronting our farmers,
and the fact that the government is facing
an election in the near future. We are often
reminded that we are appointed to this
chamber without fear of the electorate and
that we should use our calm judgment in dealing with measures that come before us. Incidentally, I should like to see a debate in this
house some time as to all the rights and
powers of the Senate. I am not a constitutional authority, but from what I have read
I understand that the Senate of Canada differs from the House of Lords in that our
chamber has the power to make amendments
such as the one reported from the Banking
and Commerce Committee.
Honourable senators, for these reasons I
propose to vote against the amendment of
the leader of the government.
The
Chairman:
Honourable
senators,
before there is any further discussion I should
like to point out that some confusion exists
as to just what is before the committee. I
think I should explain that the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce
amended the Excise Tax Act by inserting
the word "margarine" after the word "lard"
in line 2 on page 9 of the bill. What is
being discussed by the Committee of the
Whole at the present time is a motion by the
Honourable Senator Robertson, seconded by
the Honourable Senator Beaubien, that that
amendment be not concurred in.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, may I say just a few words to justify
the position I took as a member of the
Banking and Commerce Committee when
I voted for the amendment passed by that
committee? The honourable gentleman from

APRIL 22, 1953
Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) has said that
if there were no farmers there would be no
In one sense I agree with his
Canada.
statement. Incidentally, I too have milked
many cows in years gone by and I know a
little about the farming communities of our
country. I also know something about the
urban municipalities, and I would ask the
honourable senator from Blaine Lake what
Canada would be without its cities. Where
would the farmers be without the services
they get from the cities? The fact is that
Canada is not made up of any one class,
but of a great diversity of classes. Our duties
as members of parliament, as legislators, is
to hold the balance even between these various diversified sections of our communities.
The member from Trenton (Hon. Mr.
Fraser) has said that he is in favour of a
free economy. I know that is what he has
stood for, because I, have listened to his
speeches for years. He has never been a
protectionist; he has always stood for a free
economy. Yet, he admits that the question
before us at the moment is purely a matter
of competition and that his opposition to the
present proposal to exempt oleomargarine is
solely for the protection of one section of
the community against another.
Now, I am for freedom, and I have seldom,
if ever, deviated from that course. It is
true, however, that I come from an old urban
centre, and therefore I know something about
the homes of a great city. I know that
oleomargarine is not only a food, which everybody seriously admits, but it is also a food of
the poorer sections of our communities. So,
I take it that it would be a blessing to a
very large number of people if the price of
oleomarga:rine were in some way reduced.
I think it was the leader of the government
who said there was no guarantee that if we
ireduced the tax upon oleomargarine the
benefit would be passed on to the consumer.
Granted there is no guarantee in writing, but
does not the same argument apply to all the
other items in the free list? What guarantee
have we that a reduction in taxes on the
other items has been passed on to the consumer? And if the argument applies to oleomargarine, is it not equally applicable to
every other exemption enumerated in the
schedules of the Act? We do know, from
general experience, that a cost, such as a
sales tax, is not absorbed by the manufacturer or the dealer 'but is passed on to the
ultimate consumer. And we do know-I have
enough faith in the general principles of
political economy that this is generally sothat when costs are reduced, if competition is
free and not regulated by a combine, the
benefit of the reduction is passed on to the
consumer.

For that reason, very shortly put, I am in
favour of the amendment proposed by the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
I regret that I came in a few minutes late
this afternoon and missed the early sentences of the most persuasive remarks of
the leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Robertson), but I think I heard enough of
what he said to be entirely out of sympathy
with his appeal to fear on our part to accept
the responsibility which is rightly ours. The
Fathers of Confederation, when they were
framing the constitution under which we act,
provided, in conformity with the English
practice, that bills involving the expenditure
of money should be consented to by the
Crown and introduced in the Commons by
a member of the executive. That is the only
limitation upon us. We have precisely the
same rights and responsibilities as have the
private members of the House of Commons,
and we are charged with the same duty of
scrutinizing the acts of the administration.
It was suggested to us, and I quote almost
the words of the leader, that if we are opposed
to some item in a money bill we are free
to say so but we must not reject it. Well,
honourable senators, is that not reducing this
house to the mere status of a debating society?
We are given the authority to stop taxation,
not to initiate.it, and by what argument could
we justify the shuffling off of that responsibility and allowing it to be exerôised by the
administration without the supervision that
was intended by the constitution to be given
to this bouse and the House of Commons?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: May I ask a question,
purely relating to my honourable friend's
remarks on the constitution, with which I
am not arguing? I think I heard him say that
a money bill must be presented in the House
of Commons by a minister. Could a private
member of the House of Commons move an
additional tax?
Some Hon. Senators: No.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Or make a motion that
would deprive the government of certain
moneys? I think we have the same rights
as the House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: What I want to know
is if a private member could move in the
House of Commons an amendment such as
was brought in by the Banking and Commerce Committee.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, in my judgment
he could. My friend has asked me two questions. First: Can a private member introduce a taxing measure? He cannot. Technically speaking, he cannot introduce a

444

SENATE

money bill. But let me point out that no
money bill consented to by the crown and
introduced by the executive can become law
without the consent of the members of parliament assembled in the House of Commons
and in the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: But I am asking if a
private member can make the proposal.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: He cannot move a proposal to tax, but he can say to the government that it must not impose a certain tax, or
impose a tax in a particular way. We have
a right to stop the taxes, and if you take
that power away from us you might as well
abolish the House of Commons and the
Senate both.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: One of the chief purposes of parliament is to control taxation.
Were we to surrender the right of this house
to stop taxes that we do not approve of, we
would surrender the very essence of our
freedom. When a money bill comes here we
usually say "Yes" to it, but the very fact that
we say "Yes" also implies that we may say
"No", if we prefer so to do. There is not any
doubt about our constitutional powers with
regard to this bill. Our own Parliamentary
Counsel has advised us that we have a right
to make this amendment to reduce taxes. But
the leader suggests that as a matter of common sense we should surrender our responsibilities and become mere rubber stamps for
the administration, that we should approve
all money measures passed by the Commons,
because otherwise there might be a clash
and a showdown between the two houses.
Before the amendments that have been
proposed by the Committee on Banking and
Commerce can become law they must be
approved by this house and be concurred in
by the House of Commons. We in this house
will exercise our rights and the members
of the other house will exercise theirs, but
until we agree the amendments cannot pass.
There could perhaps be a servile surrender
by us to the will of the House of Commons,
but I for one have no intention of escaping
my responsibility.
The two houses of parliament have so far
been getting along very well. I have yet to
know a member of the other house who
would wish us to surrender our rights,
responsibilities and powers and slavishly
follow the course set in that house. There
is no contest between the two bouses in the
matter of this amendment; each has its own
function and its own responsibility.
I do not think we should shirk our responsibility for fear of something which might

happen to us. We should fearlessly express
our opinions and views, and if the matter
comes to a vote we should back up our
convictions with our vote. I believe the
removal of the sales tax from margarine
would be a good thing for our people, both
in the cities and on the farms; and being
on the side of economic freedom, I am going
to vote for the amendment.
Hon.

Cyrille

Vaillancouri:

Honourable

senators, I have only a few words to add to
this rather lengthy debate.
Today I wish to plead the case of a minority which can assure us life or death-the
agricultural minority. If the land continues
to be abandoned, very soon it will cease to
produce. This problem is being debated in
such international conferences as the Food
and Agricultural Organization, and the question of whether one hundred years hence the
production of food will be sufficient to the
needs of mankind is being anxiously considered. Nothing should be done to aggravate
this situation and to discourage farmers
further. Why are our youth abandoning the
land, if it is not that farming is no longer
profitable and that certain influences are
being exerted so that it will become even less
profitable? Under the pretext of protecting
the consumer, certain powerful interests are
protected and the farmer is led to ruination.
Some would like this famous controversy
over margarine to be considered merely on
the basis of butter versus margarine. It is
not purely a choice between butter and margarine. The problem is broader than that: it
means economic life or death to a great
number of our farmers. During the past few
months the price of cattle has gone down by
50 per cent. Was the retail price of meat
in the cities lowered in the same proportion?
No; the intermediary made more money, and
the consumer benefited to the extent of
approximately only 10 or 15 per cent. In the
past two or three years there has been a
decrease of 27 per cent in the wholesale prices
of vegetable oils which go into the manufacture of margarine, while in 1952 the retail
price of the product was lowered to the extent
of only 10 per cent. If the manufacturers of
margarine wished to protect the consumer,
why did they not lower the retail price of that
product in the same proportion as the wholesale price?
A great proportion of the vegetable oils
which enter into the manufacture of margarine are imported from abroad; and the
workers who process these oils are paid lower
salaries than are our labourers. No duty is
paid on two-thirds of these oils. Now some
people would have us remove the 10 per cent

APRIL 22, 1953
sales tax. Do you believe that the consumer
will benefit if this tax is withdrawn? Why,
during the past two years, did the consumer
derive little or no benefits from the substantial decrease in the cost of the basic products
which enter into margarine? Do you believe
that the 10 per cent sales tax bas simply
been added to the cost of margarine? The
20, 25 or 30 per cent which the intermediaries
want as profits, apply to the sales tax as
well as to the initial cost of margarine. And
is this amendment for the protection of the
consumer?
Let interested persons stop
deceiving us with words, and let them state
honestly and truly that they want to protect
certain large manufacturers of margarine.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Nonsense.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: The facts prove it.
In answer to the statement of my friend from
Waterloo, that this is a question of competition between the farmers and the manufacturers of margarine, let me say that the
farmers are ready and willing to compete
with iargarine, but they can only do so when
the competition is on an honest and fair
basis. They cannot meet competition which
is provided by slave labour.
This amendment is supposedly for the consumer's protection. But what about the butter producer?
Have the salaries of city
labourers decreased to a considerable extent
during the past two years? On the contrary,
they have increased, and every day we are
faced with claims for further salary increases,
shorter working hours, etc. The farmer must
toil from sunrise until after sunset. Has there
been any increase in his income, or bas it
remained the same? On the contrary, his
income bas decreased to a great extent, and
he must pay his employees higher wages thari
ever before. This accounts for the decrease
in our rural population. At present only 30
per cent of our population is rural, and 70
per cent is urban. In ten years our rural
population may not exceed 25 per cent or
even 20 per cent of the total. This is a
serious problem worthy of our consideration.
Allow me to cite facts which will prove my
allegations. In my province of Quebec we
have an organization called Caisses Populaires
which deals with labourers and farmers.
Accurate statistics for the year 1952 show the
following results: of every dollar deposited
during 1952 in the rural Caisses Populaires
2-9 per cent remained on deposit at the end
of the year, in comparison with 4-3 per cent
for the year 1951; but in urban Caisses Populaires 7-4 per cent remained on deposit at the
end of 1952, compared with 4-9 per cent
at the end of 1951. And the habitant in my

province is not different from the farmer anywhere else. At the beginning of a crisis
the farmer always bears the brunt.
For those reasons, I beg my colleagues in
the Senate to defend a minority upon which
rests our economic life. In protecting this
minority we are not only protecting the
farmer, we are also protecting ourselves.
Hon. J. H. King: Honourable senators, I
shall not delay you very long. On a number of occasions it has been my privilege to
assist in a small way the efforts of my honourable friend from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) to make margarine available to the
people of Canada. For that I have no regrets
and no apologies to offer, but I wish today
to take this stand, that it is an ill-timed proceeding to bring this question before us for
consideration within a few days of the close
of the session. The present budget was
brought down after careful consideration by
members of the government, with the assistance of the Department of Finance. It has
been discussed for six or seven weeks in
another place by the elected representatives
of the people. Although the particular item
before us seems very important today, I do
not know and cannot recall that any member of the House of Commons suggested that
it should become a public issue. So I say
that the raising of the question at this
moment is ill-timed.
I do not think the effort of my friend from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) has been valueless.
Today's discussion will be of use; and undoubtedly the declarations made and the attitude thereby expressed will be considered
next year by the Department of Finance, no
matter what government or what party is in
power, when preparations for the budget are
under way. Therefore I suggest to my good
friend that he should not press this amendment at this time,Hon. Mr. Euler: It is not my amendment.
Hon. Mr. King: -but that it should stand
over until the next session of the new parliament, which will probably be either late in
1953 or early in 1954. In my view the Senate
would be ill-advised to pass the amendment
recommended by the committee. I personally
will oppose it on the ground that it is illtimed.
Hon. W. M. Aselline: Honourable senators,
before this debate is closed I should, I think,
explain briefly the position that I intend to
take in connection with the amendment made
in the Banking and Commerce Committee.
On the first occasion when the oleomargarine issue came up I opposed the attempt of the
honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) to have the Dairy Industry Act

SENATE
amended. The next time it came up I supported
him

to

te extent of voting for the

second

reading of his bill, in the hope that if it went
to committee for study all sides of the question would be heard. However, the bill was,
I believe, defeated in this chamber. Again,
when he proposed that the legal questions
involved in the importation and sale of margarine be sent to the Supreme Court of Canada for decision, I supported him.
Margarine is here to stay, and I have no
objection to the colouring of it; in fact I am
in favour of it being coloured, because, contrary to the views of my honourable friend
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) I believe
that, so far from this product being on its way
out, it will always be in demand.
However, I come from a great wheatgrowing province which is likewise a great
Saskatchewan is a large
dairy province.
exporter of butter, and our dairy industry is
carried on upon quite a large scale. I am not
in favour of taking from the dairy farmers
the little protection left to them, and I am
therefore unable to vote at this time for the
amendment presented by the committee.
I shall not go into the question of the constitutionality of our proceedings in the light of
the powers of this house, or anything of that
kind. I agree in this respect one hundred
per cent with what was said by the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck). But that is not the issue before us.
I repeat that I cannot support, by voting for
the removal of this tax, the taking away of
the small protection which remains to the
dairy farmers of this country.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Honourable senators, I am
not going to make another speech. But to the
honourable senator from Kootenay East (Hon.
Mr. King), who suggested that I should withdraw the motion, I may say that the motion
is not mine to withdraw.
One other thing: to a statement made by
the honourable senator from Kennebec (Hon.
Mr. Vaillancourt) I interjected "Nonsense",
because I understood him to intimate that I
had ulterior motives in mind in bringing this
matter before the Banking and Commerce
Committee. If that is what he meant, his
statement was nonsense. If that is not what
he meant, I am quite willing to withdraw my
statement and apologize to him. Otherwise,
I think he ought to apologize to me.
Hon. J. Wesley Stambaugh: Honourable
senators, it seems to me that the main issues
raised by the report of the Banking and

Commerce Committee is that of dairy farmers
versus urban dwellers. It is pointed out that
if the sales tax is removed, workers in the
cities will be able to purchase margarine for
less money-possibly 2J cents a pound less.
But let me ask, who is going to "pay the
shot"? And, are these people who have to
"pay the shot" able ta do so?
Only one class of people will bear this
loss, and that is the dairy farmers.
Let us examine the position of the dairy
farmer during the last year as compared
with that of the urban worker. Today in
Canada farmers comprise 21 per cent of the
population, but their income is only slightly
more than 13 per cent of the national income.
Approximately 16 per cent of the farming
population is engaged in the dairy industry,
and their income is only about 13 per cent of
the income of all farmers in Canada. The
dairy farmers are the hardest working and
the poorest paid of any class in Canada. Last
year the income of urban workers in Canada
was up 12 per cent, whereas the income of
the farmers dropped 24 per cent. That puts
the case in a nutshell. By passing the committee's amendment we would be giving
something to the people whose income went
up 12 per cent, and taking it way from
those whose income dropped 2, per cent.
The general cost of living in Canada has
gone down during the past year because of a
reduction in the price of farm produce. If we
pass this bill as amended by the Banking and
Commerce Committee we shall be reducing
the income of the most important, the hardest
working, and the poorest paid group in
Canada.
Some Hon. Senalors: Question!
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
if I speak now it will be to close the debateHon. Mr. Reid: It is something new to me
if a debate can be closed in Committee of
the Whole.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: An honourable senator
can speak as many times as he likes.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I made a motion.
The Chairman: A motion has been made,
and when the mover speaks again he will
be closing the debate.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
a very few minutes of the time of this house
will suffice for what I have to say this afternoon. The amendment under consideration

APRIL 22. 1953
is to reverse part of the report of the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce,
and to restore the sales tax on margarine.
On the basis of the information given us by
the leader of the government, which I have
no doubt is correct, the exemption from the
sales tax on margarine would amount to
about 21 cents a pound. I suppose we can
assume that the consumer would get the full
benefit of this reduction. I am sure that no
honourable senator thinks for a moment that
a reduction of 2j cents a pound in the price
of margarine-assuming that the full reduction is carried through-would have any
noticeable effect on the dairy industry.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Why bother with it
then?
Hon. Mr. Horner: It will.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: These things change as
we go along. Progress made by science and
invention cannot be held up for the benefit
of any class of people, and I shall oppose
the amendment moved by the leader of the
government.
I should like to put one question to my
colleagues in this house. What would be
the result if a plebiscite were taken today
of all Canadians as to whether they favoured
the abolition of the 10 per cent sales tax on
margarine? I think the people would overwhelmingly vote to do away with this sales
tax.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: How would Quebec vote?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I can only say to the
honourable senator from Bedford (Hon. Mr.
Nicol) that my knowledge of Quebec is not
comparable to his, but I predict that my
honourable friend would be amazed at the
support this proposal would get even in his
own province.
Sorne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: You cannot even buy margarine in Quebec.
Hon. Mr. Euler: They just seized 5,000
pounds of it in that province.
Hon. Mr. Roberison: Honourable senators,
I want to emphasize that my amendment proposes that the third amendment made by
the Banking and Commerce Committee be
not concurred in. I listened to the speeches
of honourable senators with great interest.
I must disagree with the statement of the
honourable senator from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid) that I suggested that the

point at issue is whether or not margarine
is a food. Perhaps I misunderstood him,
but I made no such suggestion. I said that
the whole question is how to go about
exempting margarine from the imposition of
a sales tax if that is what is felt advisable
by honourable senators.'
I have often envied the ability of the
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) to express himself, and
he has raised a pertinent point in this discussion. He said he thought I had advised
the house there was no guarantee that if we
reduced the taxation upon margarine the
benefit would be passed on to the consumer.
That statement should be considered in the
light of what I said earlier.
At the outset of my remarks I expressed
the opinion that we had the constitutional
right to amend this bill. I also said I would
not discuss the pros and cons of whether
margarine should be exempted from the
imposition of the sales tax. I then warned
that by attempting to reduce the rate of
taxation, the incidence of taxation, or the
estimates, the Senate might be setting itself
up as a second budget-making authority.
Some honourable senators are more familiar
than I am with the operation of government
departments, but I take it that the officials
of the Department of Finance have full
information on all these matters, and that
any benefit resulting from a removal of the
sales tax on margarine would go to the consumer. I was merely suggesting that we are
not equipped to act as budgeteers. I thought
that if we once embarked upon such a policy
we would not stop at margarine. I do not say
we should not exercise our rights, and that
we do not have the power to amend this bill.
In the past the Chairman of the Standing
Committee on Finance (Hon. Mr. Crerar) has
protested in this house, on behalf of his
committee, against expenditures by departmental officials for travelling purposes and
so on, which the committee thought were too
high, but he did not actually recommend that
the estimates be reduced. The drawing of
the matter to the attention of the government in that way did not preclude the
possibility of a reduction in the estimate, if
the government saw fit to make one, and it
seems to me that it would have been better
if a similar method had been adopted in this
case.
In making these remarks I have had no
desire to detract in any way from the
authority or power of this house. I simply

CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 223, an Act to amend
the Canadian Wheat Board Act, 1935.
He said: Honourable senators, the chief
purpose of this bill is to extend until July
31, 1957, certain sections of the Canadian
Wheat Board Act which give the board
powers to continue as the sole marketing
agency for Western wheat, oats and barley,
and which would otherwise expire at the
end of the current crop year. The Canadian
Wheat Board was originally set up in 1935
and was what might be described as a voluntary board; that is, it might pay a specified
price and distribute profits in the form of
participation payments. Farmers, however,
were still free to sell on the open market.
In 1943, to meet the wartime emergency, the
Wheat Board became the sole marketing
agency through which Western producers
could sell their wheat. In effect this was the
beginning of the present system of wheat
board marketing, when the board became a
wheat pool handling all Western wheat, making initial payments at the time of delivery,
and declaring interim and final payments as
the wheat was finally sold out of the pool.
This operation continued until 1947, under
the War Measures Act and the Transitional
Powers Act, when the system had gained such
popularity that, in response to requests from
various agricultural organizations, the Wheat
Board Act was amended to continue the
powers of .the board as the marketing agency
of Western wheat. In fact, the operation was
so acceptable that in 1949 it was expanded
to include oats and barley.
The achievements of the board in maintaining a stable level of prices for wheat, and
its able handling of the damaged crop of
1950, need not be reviewed at this time. Suffice
it to say that, in the absence of such an
organization, it would be difficult to visualize
the problems that have arisen in the handling
of the record crop of 1952, which was the
largest ever harvested on the prairies of
Canada, comprising 664 million bushels of
wheat, 346 million bushels of oats and 281
million bushels of barley.

APRIL 22, 1953
It has been suggested in some quarters that
this act might be extended indefinitely, but
it is the government's view that the Parliament of Canada should decide as to the proper
system of marketing wheat. Therefore, a
definite period for expiry of the act is
established.
The technical amendments deal briefiy with
an increase in the number of commissioners
from three to not more than five, and a
proviso to allow the Board to charge to
moneys arising from the sale of wheat any
expenses incurred in respect to the International Wheat Council or succeeding organizations.
Fînally, a new section will enable the board
to set up in a separate account any unclaimed
and undistributed residual balances relating
to any type of dlaim which have remained
on the board's accounts for six years and
which may be expended for purposes considered -by the Governor in Council to be
for the benefit of wheat producers.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I
move the adjournment of the debate. May I
say that I want to discuss the motion standing on our Order Paper for approval of the
International Wheat Board Agreement, and
I shall reserve my remarks on this measure
until that motion is before us.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.

TRANS-CANADA

AIR LINES BILL

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Salter A. Hayden presented the report

of the Standing Committee on Transport and
Communications on Bill 330, an Act to amend
the Trans-Canada Air Lines Act, 1937.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant
as follows:
The Standing Committee on Transport and Com-

mnications, to whom was referred the bill (330
from the House of Commons), intituled: "An Act
to amend the Trans-Canada Air Lines Act, 1937".
have in obedience to the order of reference of
April 21, 1953, examined the said bill and now beg
leave to report the same without any amendment.
THIRD READING
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Honourable senators,
with leave of the Senate, I move the third
reading now.
Before the bill is given third reading I
think it advisable to place on the record an
explanation in answer to a suggestion made
the other evening that the bill contained
something by way of tax avoidance.
When Trans-Canada Air Lines was set up
the Canadian National Railways subscribed

$25 million and acquired all the shares issued
at that time. In those days there was no
problem of payment of income tax by a
crown company so that the manner of the
capital set-up from the viewpoint of income
tax was unimportant. Needless to say the

Canadian National Railway Company got the
money it advanced to Trans-Canada Air
Lines from the source-and the only source
-open to it; that is it borrowed money from
the government, paid interest to the govern-

ment on the borrowing, invested it in T.C.A.
and received payments in an equivalent
amount from T.C.A., which it remitted by
way of interest to the government.
Honourable senators will

recall

that

in

P

bit

hcause in 1952 and

thereafter Trans-Canada Air Lines, for bookkeeping purposes, treated its payments to the
Canadian National Railways as interest on
the money put up; although, as stock had
been taken in exchange for the advance, in
reality it was a dividend. A realistic approach
is provided to the question of the moneys
advanced, because were it treated as a dividdend it would take considerably more money
from Trans-Canada Air Lines to pay the
Canadian National Railways so that the Canadian National Railways could then pay its
interest charge to the dominion government.
So the bill in one of its provisions enacts that
the Canadian National Railways shall surrender or deliver up for cancellation
$20,000,000 of the capital shares which were
issued, retaining only $5,000,000 in shares,
and that for the $20,000,000 of shares so
returned T.C.A. will issue debentures or
notes or bonds in that amount.
The provision of the bill which gave rise
to the suggestion of tax avoidance is that, for
1952, the first year in which T.C.A. became
subject to income tax, and until the date in
1953 when this bill is passed, payments made
by T.C.A. to the C.N.R. in respect of the
moneys put up by the latter corporation would
be deemed, to the extent of 3 per cent, payment of interest. A payment of interest
would, of course, be a deductible item of
expense so far as T.C.A. is concerned. You
would then have the more realistic picture
that the Canadian National Railways borrowed from the dominion government, paid
3 per cent on the money, and put that money
in the hands of T.C.A., from which it received
3 per cent, the one charge remaining at the
same level all the way through. To leave it
as a dividend for 1952 would take substantially more money from T.C.A., since that
organization would first have to pay taxes on
that portion of the profits and afterwards pay
the money by way of dividend to the C.N.R.
The money came out of the pocket of the
Government of Canada and, by the route followed, it is going back into the pocket of the
Government of Canada, so it was felt that in
those circumstances the charge should be
treated as an interest charge. That is the
effect of the section.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.

1952, by an amendment to the Income Tax
Act, it was provided that certain crown com-

pleasure in submitting the following report,
which I shall read into the record so that its

The Standing Committee on Divorce beg leave
to make their 300th report, as follows:
For the present session 344 petitions for bills of

follows:

Your committee makes the same recommendation
that it made in 1950, 1951 and 1952 reports. It
regrets that parliament has not seen fit to solve
the problem of parliamentary divorce by setting up
suitabIe courts or tribunals before which the numerous cases from Quebec and Newfoundland could
be heard. It is to be hoped that something will
be done in that regard in the near future.

Total ................................
344
Of the petitions recommended during the present
session of parliament 96 were by husbands and 186
were by wives.
Of the petitions recommended 8 were from petitioners domiciled in the province of Newfoundland
and 274 were from petitioners domiciled in the
province of Quebec.
The committee held 49 meetings. On 21 days the
committee functioned in two sections.
In 13 cases the committee recommended that part
of the parliamentary fees be remitted.
The fees paid to parliament for bills of divorce
heard and recommended during the session of
1952-53 amounted to $57,520.
Assuming that ail bills of divorce recommended
by the committee, now in various stages before
parliament, recelve Royal Assent, the comparison of
dissolutions of marriage granted by parliament in
the last ten sessions is as follows:
1945, 179; 1946, 290; 1947, 348.

Honourable senators, before tabling the
report I wish to make a few remarks. In the
sessions of 1951 and 1952 I spoke quite extensively on this subject and I do not intend to
repeat now what I said then. I should like,
however, to call the attention of honourable
senators to the fact that since 1947 the number
of divorces in Canada has decreased considerably. In that year, which as I mentioned
earlier was the peak year, 8,199 divorces were
granted. The 1946 figure was 7,683. The total
for 1952 was lower than 1947 by 2,637.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: 1952 was lower by how
many?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: In the whole country
there were 2,637 fewer divorces in 1952 than
in 1947.
Before resuming my seat I should like to
thank sincerely the members of the committee
who were so faithful in their attendance and
ably assisted the Chairman in the committee's
arduous task. During many weeks this session the committee sat every day of the week.
I should also like to express my appreciation
of the work done by the Chief Clerk of Committees and his capable staff. Without their
careful attention to the clerical work, we
could not have carried on. I also wish to
thank the Senate's reporting staff, who were
on duty over many week-ends and deserve a
lot of credit.
I come now to my annual hope that perhaps
before the beginning of the next session I
may be relieved of work on the Divorce Committee.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: You are too good.
Han. Mr. Aseltine: Every session for some
years past I have expressed that hope, but
when a new session of parliament is
assembled no one seems ready and wiuing ta
take over ry duties, £0 in each instance I
have agreed to act for one more session.
With leave of the Senate, I would file my
report and ask that it be printed in the
Minutes of Proceedings.

SENATE

Hon. W. H. Golding: Honourable senators,

I would not want to let this opportunity pass

services he has rendered and the very valuable work he has done on behalf of the

without expressing on behalt of every niemi-

ber of the Divorce Committee our appreciation
of the services so freely and capably given by
the chairman (Hori. Mr. Aseltine). And I
feel that I can express the same.sentiment on
behalf of all other members of the Senate as
well.
I have made a survey of the number of
divorce petitions handled by the committee
during the years that the present chairman
has served in that capacity or as a member.
While many senators in the past have given
long service on the committee, he holds the
record of having recommended the granting
of more divorces than did any of his predecessors. May I put on the record the results
of my survey?

A search of the Journals of the Senate
reveals the respective periods served and
volume of work accomplished by the following

senators:
The

honourable

senator

from

Rosetown

(Hon. Mr. Aseltine), has been on the committee since 1934, during a total of twenty-three
sessions. For the last ten years he has been
chairman. During his period of membership
3,081 divorce petitions have been granted,
2,416 of them during his term as chairman.
This figure does net include cases heard during the present session.
The late Scnator Sir James Lougheed was
a member of the committee from 1890 to
1925, both years inclusive, during which time
1,072 divorces were granted. He was chairman for two years.
The late Senator MeMeans was a member
of the committee from 1925 to 1938, inclusive,
a total of 14 sessions, and for ten sessions
he was chairman. During his period of service 1,407 petitions were granted, 844 of
which were granted while he was chairman.
The late Senator Robinson was a member
of the committee from 1927 to 1947, inclusive,
a total of eighteen sessions. For six years he
was chairman. During his membership 1,875
divorces wTere granted, 504 of which were
granted during his period as chairman.
The late Senator Copp was a member of
the committee from 1928 to 1949, both years
inclusive, a total of twenty-three sessions.
During his membership, 2,807 petitions were
recommended.
Those figures, honourable senators, will
serve to confirm my previous observation
that the present chairman has handled more
petitions than did any of his predecessors,
all of whom served for many years. I am
sure we are all grateful to him for the able

Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Honourable
Hon. Norman P. Lamberi:
senators, in the absence of the leader of the
government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) I am sure
that all members of this body would wish
me to convey warmest words of appreciation
to the chairman of the Divorce Committee
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) for his very interesting
report and also for the quality of the service
that he has rendered, not only to the members of this chamber but to parliament as a
whole and the public outside.
I would also like to express on behalf of
the members of this chamber appreciation of
efficient services which have been
the
rendered on that committee by the other
members. The impressive record which has
just been submitted by the honourable senator from Huron-Perth (Hon. Mr. Golding)
leads one to conclude that as time goes on
the burden upon the chairman of the Divorce
Whether the
Committee becomes heavier.
increase in the number of cases is in any
degree due to the capacity and calibre of
the chairman and his committee I would not
care to say; but in any event it appears that
the volume of work laid upon the committee
from year to year has not abated to any
marked extent. This fact provides a good
deal of food for reflection on the part of us
all. The report which has been presented
today is not only a basis of interesting study
on the part of every member of parliament,
but is worthy of assessment and appreciation
by the rank and file of Canadians throughout
the country.

Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. John. T. Haig: I do not rise te repeat
anything which bas been said by my distinguished colleague from Rosetown (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine), but having year by year sat
here and listened to reports of the Divorce
Committee, I would ask whether we have
not about reached the time when our distinguished colleagues from the province of
Quebec and elsewhere who have hitherto
declined to serve on this committee should
reconsider their decision. I understand the
reason for their attitude, and I have every
respect for the personal religious convictions
of other people, but I would remind honour-

able members that we who sit in this chamber
are appointed to serve Canada, and it is one
of our duties in this capacity to administer
the law relating to divorce. I believe that
there are few or no political leaders in Canada, including the Prime Minister and the

APRIL 23, 1953
Leader of the Opposition in the other place
and other public men throughout the country,
who would not admit that they desire some
better system of handling divorce applications. No responsible person would press for
the establishment of divorce courts in provinces where the majority object to them.
It is their right to do what they want to do.
But a person who accepts the office of
senator ought to be willing to participate in
any of the work assigned to this body. After
an experience on the Divorce Committee
extending over many years, I feel entitled to
ask colleagues who do not belong to the
sarne church as I do to consider that they
share this responsibility. On behalf of other
members of the committee I assure them that
we would be delighted to be associated in
this work with members of the Roman Catholic faith. We would appreciate their help,
we would value their experience and their
judgment; we would esteem them for the
fervour of their religious convictions. Remember that we who serve on that committee
dislike as much as, anyone else the practice
of divorce. But in the present state of
civilization, and until the world has reached
a moral elevation at which these expedients
are unnecessary, people who serve on divorce
tribunals must act in accordance with their
conviction that, under given circumstances,
they can do no other than deal with the petitions which come before them. So I am
moved again to urge upon my compatriots
who live in other parts of Canada and who
up to date have not served with us, that
between now and next session they examine
their consciences and determine whether they
should not come forward and help us to carry
this burden. They are distinguished members
of this house; they render service in every
other department; and they are needed in
the department we are discussing, whose
operations deal with matters as vital to the
Roman Catholic church as to any of the
Protestant churches. The work is just as
burdensome on our souls as on the souls of
members of any other denomination. So
I again ask that between now and next
session, each senator who hitherto has not
co-operated in this particular should search
his conscience in the privacy of his own
chamber and decide whether he will not
come forward and offer some assistance.
EXCISE TAX BILL
QUESTION

OF

PRIVILEGE-EXPLANATION

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancourt: Honourable senators, I wish to say just a few words in
explanation of some remarks I made yester-

day in the debate on the Excise Tax Bill. I
should not like my colleague from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) to believe- that my remarks
reflect to any extent whatever upon his
integrity and honesty. I have known him
for more than twenty years, and I have
always appreciated his straightforwardness.
I never had any doubts about his integrity.
I hope that some day, after serious thinking,
he will become an ardent defender of the
agricultural class and a great consumer of
butter.

CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Robertson for the second reading of Bill 223,
an Act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board
Act, 1935.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I did not move the adjournment of the debate
yesterday for the purpose of making any
formal address. This bill is simply a renewal
of the present law with the addition of one
or two matters. Its principal effect is to
extend certain sections of the Wheat Board
Act until August 1, 1957. It provides for the
appointment of two extra commissioners, and
deals with expenses in relation to international wheat marketing organizations, and
also with the transfer of undistributed balances in the hands of the board. I do not
object to any of these provisions, but I
object to the bill as a whole because it
renews the compulsory features of the Canadian Wheat Board Act.
Honourable senators, I have never been
able to understand why the farmers of our
four western provinces have stuck to this
type of grain marketing through thick and
thin. I was surprised that after their experience of the first two years' operation of the
British Wheat Agreement they still believed
in this form of grain marketing. There is
no doubt that the farmers of Western Canada

SENATE
lost money under the British Wheat Agreement, despite the fact that the government

had raised that year for 53 cents a bushel.
He had expected to get only 48 cents, and

voted them a subsidy of $65 million.

Le

La us

say that Canadian farmers had a total of 300
million bushels of wheat for export, and sold
200 million bushels at the British Wheat
Agreement price and the remaining 100 million bushels at the world price. As a result of
this differential in prices the government of
Canada paid our farmers no less than $600
million over a four-year period by way of
compensation for losses they had incurred
under the agreement. It took the farmers
a long time to realize what had happened,
but they finally admitted they had lost out
under the British Wheat Agreement. After
that experience I hardly thought they would
be in favour of the International Wheat
Agreement, but they were, and they lost no
less than $50 million a year under it.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: The Wheat Board was
not responsible.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am not saying that. The
farmers supported the Wheat Board which
took arbitrary action and made the agreement.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The Wheat Board did
not do it; it was the government.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am not going to criticize
the government for having made the British
Wheat Agreement, because I honestly believe
that in the circumstances any government of
this country would have made it. I say this
because I know what the sentiment of the
three Prairie Provinces was. The wheat pools
n those provinces were 100 per cent in
favour of the agreement.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: That is not the Wheat
Board.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, the effect is the same.
My colleague thinks the Wheat Board is all
right, but I do not agree with him. However,
that is not the issue.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: The farmers think a
great deal of the Wheat Board.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The Wheat Board carried
out the British Wheat Agreement and the
International Agreement, and despite the
losses our farmers have suffered under these
agreements they still favour a system of
international wheat marketing. Do not forget
that the price under the agreement is lower
than the current world price. I can only
account for this situation in one way. Men
of my age who were brought up on the
prairies can easily recall selling wheat for
50 or 60 cents a bushel. I can well remember
my father coming home one time and telling
my mother that he had sold the wheat he

Tri

later years when Mr. Gardiner, the present
Minister of Agriculture, was Premier of
Saskatchewan, he suggested that the Western
farmers should be paid about 90 cents a
bushel for their wheat. It was said that this
could never be done, but they received at
least 80 cents, which was considered to be a
really good price. I remember that in 1887
Saskatchewan and Alberta had a poor wheat
crop but Manitoba had a fair one. Wheat
was in short supply at that time and our
farmers were able to sell at 75 cents a
bushel, and they thought they were millionaires. In recent years farmers have been
getting $1.55 under the British Wheat Agreement and $1.80 under the International
Wheat Agreement. These prices probably
seem like a lot to them when compared with
the old prices. For some reason the farmers
just can't realize that the low wheat prices
of the period from 1930 to 1935 existed al
over the world; they still blame the Winnipeg
Grain Exchange because wheat went down
to 35 cents a bushel.
Honourable senators, the government is
asking for an extension of the Canadian
Wheat Board Act because of the International
Wheat Agreement which is currently being
negotiated, but the Prime Minister of Britain
claims that his country, which is the largest
purchaser of wheat, will not enter into
this agreement. Now, I do not believe any
International Wheat Agreement can succeed
unless the British are a party to it. Manitoba
and Alberta are not satisfied with the proposed price, but on the other hand the wheat
pool in Saskatchewan is. There is no doubt
that Britain's reason for not becoming a party
to this agreement is that she feels the price
of grain will go down. A certain honourable
senator in this house is a distinguished grain
dealer, whose memory goes back about as
far as mine, and I am sure he can recall
when people in Winnipeg and Chicago said
they could outguess the grain market. But
nobody ever did. The British have been
pretty good guessers. They gambled that the
price of grain would not go down, and under
the British Wheat Agreement they paid 50
cents a bushel less than they would have paid
on the world market. They also gained under
the International Wheat Agreement. But
what are they going to do now? What is to
prevent Britain from buying wheat from
Russia?
She is already buying oats and
barley from Russia, and it is not unthinkable
that she will sell manufactured goods to that
country and buy wheat in return. The British
are hard bargainers, and at this very moment

Some of thern may lose their participation certificate and forget all about it; or they may
even get a cheque for a small amount and
lose it. At any rate, for some such reasons
and others, the total of these claims is the
amount I have mentioned.
There is a provision that I think should
be clarified when the bill goes to committee,
as I presume it will. Under the International
Wheat Agreement of 1949 it was provided
that the expenses of the Wheat Council, which
was set up under the agreement, would be
paid by the various governments parties to
the agreement, on a pro rata basis. Although
the language is rather vague, the explanatory
note to section 4 appears to indicate that hereafter the expenses of the Wheat Council, apart
from the expenses of delegates from the
Wheat Board or the pools attending meetings
of the council, shall be a charge against the
grain marketed. If my impression as to the
meaning of this section is correct, I think we
should have some information on that point
when the bill is before the committee. But
the main purpose of the bill is of course to
continue the arbitrary powers presently
invested in the Wheat Board under the existing law.
I should like to draw the attention of the
house to the character and extent of these
powers. They are all-embracing. But before
dealing with that may I, for the information
of the house, recite the steps leading to the
wheat agreement with Great Britain signcd
on July 24, 1946, and the International Wheat
Agroment which was consummated in 1949
for a four-year period.
The Wheat Board was first set up by legislation passed at the 1935 session, when the
late Lord Bennett was Prime Minister of
Canada. At the time the legislation was introduced it provided that the board should have
compulsory powers. As a matter of historie
interest, the Liberal party of that day bélieved
in liberal principlesSome Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I am not saying that it
does not now believe in those principlesthough it does not always practice them. The
Liberal party of that day fought against the
introduction of the compulsory principle in
the legislation. The fight was so effective that
the compulsory principle was dropped and for
reasons which I shall mention presently, did
not come into play until 1943.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Will my honourable
friend permit me a question? He seems to
have jumped from 1935 to 1943.

Hon. Mr. Crerar: No, I have not.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I should like to ask him
if he has overlooked tne significance of Lit
Turgeon Commission and the failure to carry
out its recommendations.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: As I recall it, the Turgeon
Commission made no recommendation for the
introduction of the compulsory principle in
the marketing of grain.
Hon. Mr. Lamber: My honourable friend
misunderstood my question. The result of
the operation of the Wheat Board during
Lord Bennett's time was such that something
like 350 million bushels of wheat were accumulated. When the new government came
into power it adopted a policy of liquidating
that surplus, and at the same time appointed
a royal commission to investigate the whole
question of marketing, trading and options,
for the purpose of re-establishing the freeThe commission made its
trade market.
report in 1937, but resistance on the part of
western members of parliament in the House
of Commons was so strong that its recommendations were never put into effect, and
the Wheat Board continued.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: My honourable friend has
anticipated what I was about to say.
The Canadian Wheat Board Act was
passed in 1935. But between 1930 and 1935
a considerable volume of the wheat export
of this country was carried on under a bank
guarantee from the federal government to
the Co-operative Wheat Producers, the marketing agency for the three western pools.
As a condition of giving that guarantee, the
government of the day insisted that the late
John I. McFarland be put in charge of these
operations.
After 1935 there was a change in the management and policy of the Wheat Board, and
the go-ernment, as my honourable friend
from Ottawa (IIon. Mr. Lambert) has said,
appointed a royal commission which brought
in a very interesting report. The fact that
its major recommendations may not have
been carried out is not germane to the argument that I am now putting forward.
After it came into being on August 1, 1935,
the Wheat Board functioned first under Mr.
McFarland for several months, and later
under 'other chairmen, until September, 1943.
In 1941 the Wartime Prices and Trade Board
was set up, and the prices of commodities
generally and wages were frozen at their
level as of the date of the passage of the
Order in Council establishing that board.
As it was recognized that wheat had been at
a very low price for a number of years, it
was not brought under the operation of the
freeze -order. It was not until September,

APRIL 23, 1953
1943, when wheat had risen to approximately
$1.25 a bushel, that it came under the freezing order and trading in futures on the
Winnipeg Exchange ceased.
The argument has been made in Western
Canada that the Wheat Board cannot function without compulsory powers. But the
fact is that from 1935 to 1943 the board operated as an agent of the producers without
a single compulsory power.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I would point out to
my honourable friend that those were wartime years, and they cannot be compared with
the present period.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: From 1943 until 1946
wheat was marketed through the Wheat
Board as the sole marketing agency under
the policy of the Wartime Prices and Trade
Board. In 1946 the British Wheat Agreement
was entered into under the authority conferred by the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act.
In 1947, more than two years after the war
ended, parliament passed its first Wheat
Board legislation, having within it the compulsory principle, in the form of the parent
bill of the one before us today. Under the
powers then granted, the board had full and
complete control over the marketing of grain.
Marketing has been controlled to such an
extent that an individual farmer could not
market his grain until he received a permit
from a government representative; no railway company could transport it, and no
elevator company could handle it until a
permit was forthcoming from the representative of the Wheat Board.
There were other restrictive provisions. For
instance, I as an individual farmer could
not sell seed wheat produced by me in Manitoba to a farmer in Saskatchewan or Alberta
or anywhere outside the province until I
got a permit to do so. This illustrates the
character of the legislation, and it is against
this control feature that I protest, and will
continue to protest as long as I am able to do
so. I have not the slightest objection to a
wheat board which is an agent of the producers and not an agent of the crown. Today,
by law, the board is an agent of the crown,
and the govermnent have complete control
over every phase of marketing policy relating to wheat and to some other grains as
well, and have to accept the consequences for
what follows.

Hon. Mr. Euler: He would not do that.

Hon. Mr. Reid: I know. But I am just wondering about it.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: As I have said, it is
against that compulsory principle in the legislation that I protest. How can it be justified
in a free country? It may be said that a
majority of the prairie farmers want this
legislation. For the sake of argument let
us grant that that is true. Does that justify
parliament in passing legislation which
imposes a hardship on the dissenting minority? Where in the history of this parliament can it be found that we adopted the
principle that, in matters of this kind, where
one's natural rights are involved, the majority
shall rule and the minority may be oppressed
and held down? That is the principle which
is involved in this bill, and, let me repeat,
it is against this principle I protest.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Sometimes minorities hold
down majorities.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: What is the situation with
regard to other businesses: for instance, the
great industry associated with the production of lumber and pulp from our forest
wealth? Would the government of the day,
or any government, in normal peace times,
pass legislation to set up a board with
powers of complete compulsion over the production, manufacture, sale and distribution
of timber products? Such a course is unthinkable. Yet would it not be on all fours with
this legislation?
Hon. Mr. King: Is there not this difference?
In the prairie provinces co-operative societies
and pools have been built up for the handling
of grain and these bodies, as such, were led
into this system, and are today supporting it.
You would not find that condition in any
other industry.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That may be; but the
point I am making is: has parliament any
right to impose that handicap upon a minority
because the majority want it? If it has, there
has been introduced into our law-making processés a new principle which I do not think
many in this house, if they fully realized its
implications, would support.
Hon. Mr. Ross: It is very democratic and
good Liberalism, is it not?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Judged by the actual
results to the farmers, the effect of these
agreements has been calamitous. I suppose
it is generally known that every producer of
grain in this country has not been subjected
to the same handicap as the wheat producers
of Western Canada. The farmers of Ontario
and Quebec have been free to sell their
products as they wish to do. Some may say
that the Western grain growers clamoured

SENATE
for this legislation. But again I come back to
the

nint that this does

not warrant the

imposition, by the whole weight of law, of
disabilities upon persons who do not want
to market their grain through this agency,
and who should be free to market it as they
wish. It is the product of their own labour.
Why should they have to go and get a permit
to dispose of it? Would it not be just as
reasonable to say that before any workman
could go to a job he must get a permit to do
so from some government agent? I see no
distinction in principle.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Well, that has happened.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Anyway, it may come.
Perhaps we have it now.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: My colleague from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) says it may come.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It is here already.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: We have had it, too,
in the past.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That is the crucial point
in this legislation. I have no doubt the bill
will be passed.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I have great respect for
my honourable friend, but he may be saying
"Hear, hear" just a little too soon. In 1947,
when this law was first passed, it was argued
to justify so arbitrary a measure, that it was
necessary in order to carry out the terms of
the British Wheat Agreement. Any honourable senator who is interested will find confirmation of this statement if he reads the
Hansard of either house. The same argument

was

used

to extend

the

agreement

beyond the original term: it was said to be
essential for the carrying out of the International Wheat Agreement. So it is now
sought to renew it again. It was introduced
and passed in another place before the international agreement had really collapsedas I think it has. And may I say a word
or two about that? The matter will. be
before us in a few days.
The renewal of the International Wheat
Agreement has been the subject of much
debate and discussion. Early last summer
representatives of all countries signatory to
the existing agreement met in London to
consider a renewal of it. They did not get
very far, and the meeting was adjourned to
a date subsequent to the United States elections. It was resumed in Washington at the
end of January, and for ten weeks the representatives of the exporting countries and
the importing countries tried to hammer out
an agreement. What is the result so far?
Britain, the largest purchaser under the

former agreement, announced through her
Food Minister the other day in the British
House ot Commons that slv wili 1wtb bu'scribe to the new one. India, a purchaser of
55,000,000 bushels-not an inconsiderable
amount-has also refused assent to the agreement. It remains to be seen whether Germany, whose quota was also set at 55,000,000
bushels, will indicate here assent, when, next
week, the various states are supposed to sign.
According to press reports Australia has
announced that she will not adhere to the
agreement unless Britain does.
What success can there be for an international wheat agreement when by far the
largest purchasers of our wheat will abstain
from signing it? I do not think this agreement can operate for another year with these
countries out of it. What will be the situation
then? We give the Wheat Board compulsory
powers. How is it going to sell wheat and
determine the pri.ces at which it shall offer
wheat for sale? What measuring rod will it
use to determine value? No doubt it will
continue its practice of the past seven years
when it has sold outside these agreements at
prices which at times have been much higher
than was provided in the agreements, and
when its only guide as to values was the
American
markets in Minneapolis and
Chicago. The British government will possibly, even probably, re-open the market in
Liverpool when the present agreement
terminates on July 31 of this year. What are
we to do then?
Honourable senators, I should like to see
the wisest possible solution of this problem,
and I think it can only be found by going
back to the original concept of the board as
the agent of the producers. No man should
be shackled and made to use it against his
will. Why should I have to go to a government agent to get a permit so that I may
market my grain? Why should this have to
be done in a free country? But, as I have
already said, that is the situation today. We
should get back to the situation which existed
prior to the war and to the introduction of
these compulsory powers. Let the Wheat
Board be an agent of the producers. Get the
government out of the business and let the
producers direct the Wheat Board as to what
they want it to do. I would far rather trust
their judgment than the judgment of those
who are exercising compulsory powers. If
we did this we would have something
resembling a free market.
If this compulsory principle is to remain
and grow in our economy, what will be next?
I admit that it might be argued with considerable weight that these powers have not
been abused by the government. I have no

APRIL 23, 1953
doubt that the government has tried to discharge its responsibilities wisely and well.
But that is not the basis upon which powers
of this kind should be judged. We have no
right to embed practices and principles in
our laws on the theory that the government
can always be trusted to do the right thing.
That is not the principle upon which laws
should be made, for no one knows what
government may be in power in the future.
The only safe and sound basis upon which
to consider these questions is on their merits.
I have never wavered from my conviction
that the application of a compulsory principle,
where I do no hurt to my neighbour, is
wrong and unsound.
Honourable senators, for these reasons I am
opposed to this legislation.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
yesterday I was reproved for not keeping up
to date with modern trends of the agricultural
industry, but there are some in this chamber
who need to modernize their thoughts on the
subject of wheat board marketing. Incidentally, a great deal of this discussion has
been out of order. The 'resolution asking
parliament ýto approve the International
Wheat Agreement will corne before us in
the near future, and I intend to have something to say about the agreement at that time.
I hate compulsory measures just as much
as does the honourable gentleman from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), but the fact is
we have them. I should like to ask my
honourable friend what he thinks about the
wheat quota delivery system in Western
Canada, which is certainly of a compulsory
nature. In the days when farmers used oldfashioned machinery and there was not much
wheat on the market, it was not a difficult
job for farmers to dispose of their wheat at
the grain elevators. They simply queued up
and the first man in line unloaded his wheat.
Nowadays a farmer has to produce facts about
the number of acres on his farm and so on,
and severe penalties are imposed if he is
caught trying to deliver a higher quota than
he is entitled to. The rights of the individual
are sacrified in the interests of the many. In
Western Canada a large wheat producer who
lives close to an elevator is able to deliver
all his wheat without much trouble, but a
farmer who lives some distance away often
finds upon reaching the elevator that he is
unable to sell even one 'bushel of his wheat.
Honourable senators, this quota system which
is operated on a compulsory basis will
probably remain with us for all time.
As I have said, severe penalties can be
imposed under the system, and a number of
inspectors are kept busy trying to see that

people do not exceed their quota. Despilte this
elaborate checking system one farmer was
reported to have delivered some 5,000 bushels
more than be should have. Even a hockey
team in a certain town in my district is known
as the "Quota Jumpers".
I am sure the honourable gentleman from
Churchill know1s something about the Wheat
Board at the time of the Union Government
around 1917-18. As a matter of fact, I think
he was a member of the governiment at that
time.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: No.
Hon. Mr. Horner: At any rate, that is when
the first Wheat Board was established in
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I should like to correct the honourable gentleman. In 1917-18
this country had what was known as the
Board of Grain Supervisors, and it was not
until 1919-20 that the first Wheat Board was
established.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Perhaps that is so. Anyway, I remember that in those days Henry
Wise Wood was either the chairman of the
Board or one of its directors.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: That was later on.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I remember une time
when the United Farmers of Alberta were
holding a convention in Calgary. I happened to be on a train carrying a lot of
farmers to the convention, and they were
ready to get rid of Henry Wise Wood for all
time. In those days some farmers living near
the American border were getting as much
as $3.50 a bushel for their wheat in the
United States.
Hon. Mr. Davis: Do not forget that the
Canadian dollar was at quite a discount then.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Well, they were able to
make a profit on a few loads. I tried to tell
these farmers on the train that they were
mistaken. I said that when the final payment
came they would find they had received a
very good price under the system. I was
interested. Of course, I was there on other
business, but I watched the papers to see
what became of Henry Wise Wood. I learned
that when he explained the situation and
the board's actions in connection with the
marketing of wheat, he was returned as head
of the organization with the largest vote in
its history.
The honourable senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) talks of the old system of
the Grain Exchange. What disturbs the farmers in Western Canada is that every time
grain is dealt with there is a profit to the
broker. And when grain passes through

SENATE

forty dealings, either the consumer or the
nroducer has to pay for the forty commissions. That must be plain to anyone. The
honourable senator's idea of free enterprise,
it seems to me, is "Give me a large room and
let me run a poker game, and take a
rake-off".
I have always said that for any bona fide
exporter of grain, or any dealer or miller
who takes delivery of grain to be made into
flour, an exchange is possibly necessary. But
we all know -of men who are never likely
to use a bushel of grain commercially, yet
are adept at circulating rumours to the effect
that grain is going down in price, in order
to cause grain to be taken off the market so
that they may buy it and sell again at a
profit. I certainly would not attempt to go
out and canvass the western farmer in support
of that kind of thing.
The honourable member from Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) had a visit from a highly
successful man. Apparently, under the old
system, this man had sold flax on the very
day that it was at the top price. He had got
$6.20 for it. But that price was paid on that
one day only, and then it proceeded to
tumble, and it did not stop tumbling until it
fell to $3. He had exercised his judgment
as a free individual, and I must say he did
a very fine job. But, in my opinion, ho was
fortunate. However, one farmer might sell
his grain at a certain price on the open market, and a day or two later his neighbour
might sell his at 40 cents a bushel less. They
might be men of equal ability, and both hardworking, but the one might be more fortunate
than the other.
Despite the losses that the farmers suffer
under the present system, one reason why
they are satisfied with it is that they all
receive the sane price for the same grade of
wheat.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I ask a question of
the honourable senator?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: You mentioned the Grain
Exchange. I said nothing about the operations of the Grain Exchange. Would my
honourable friend explain why the farmers'
organizations in the United States, of which
there are several, embracing hundreds of
thousands of farrners, are utterly opposed to
the closing of the futures markets in Minneapolis and Chicago?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Well, the farmers of the
United States for the past several years have
not had to market grain in that manner. They
have been subsidized, in some cases, to the
extent of 20 cents a bushel. They are securing

a good price. Why the farmers are complaining, I am sure I do not know.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: They were opposed to it
before the subsidizing started.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Yes, they opposed it.
The honourable senator talked of the
change in the Wheat Board. It was a farmers'
organization before it became a governrment
organization, in 1937, or earlier. Do you
remember what the late Dr. Motherwell said
the government did to the old Wheat Board?
He declared that the government had caponized it-taken away all its usefulness-when
it became a government organization. And
another member of the Commons said, when
the government undertook to administer the
Wheat Board, that it was like putting a weasel
in a hen coop to guard the chickens.
I well remember travelling from Ottawa,
across Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta
in 1937, and witnessing such a sight as I had
never seen in Western Canada before. I think
I am the only man living who ever predicted
the exact number of millions of bushels of
wheat produced in the West. En route to
Calgary I was up at three o'clock on the train
as it passed through that beautiful land of
grain. The crop was high and burning up.
I said there would not be more than 130 million bushels that year. The government
Wheat Board ofthat day boasted about selling
the wheat at 70 cents a bushel. I called in
the Press and said the price should be $1.25,
at least. Well, my estimate of the crop turned
out to be right, and within about a month
they were selling wheat at $1.54 a bushel.
They were making use of the grain exchange.
In the near future, I would like to see the
farmers represented on the Wheat Board
independently of the government. The system
of all sharing alike is not likely to be done
away with. I think it is here to stay, whether
we like it or not, for some time to come.
Hon. J. Wesley Slambaugh: Honourable
senators, I live quite a distance from the city
of Winnipeg, and do not think I am greatly
affected by the smoke screen and the poisonous propaganda from the Winnipeg Grain
Exchange. Nor am I greatly affected by the
copious tears shed by them over the losses
sustained by the farmers in their dealings
through the Grain Board. My neighbours
are farmers. I am personally acquainted
with most of the directors of the Alberta
wheat pool, who are bona fßde farmers. I
attend most of the farmers conventions held
in Alberta, and I think I know their feelings
so far as the Wheat Board is concerned. It
would be foolish to say that all the farmers
are satisfied with the present operations of
the board. Indeed, where could one find a

APRIL 23, 1953
group of people entirely satisfied with anything? However, I believe that the majority
-perhaps nine out of ten-of the farmers of
Alberta are better satisfied with the present
operation of the Wheat Board than they have
ever been with any other system. We contend that the present systern should be continued until something better is offered.
It is useless for anyone today to try to
estimate how much the farmer may have lost
through the operations of the Wheat Board.
A comparison can be made between the average price paid for No. 1 wheat and the price
the farmers receive, but it gives no more
accurate basis for an average price than a
computation with respect to the average price
of fruit, potatoes or any other produce which
fluctuates on the market frorn day to day.
In conclusion, I repeat that the average
Alberta farmer is very well satisfied with the
present operation of the Wheat Board.
Hon. Norman P. Lamberi: Honourable senators, when amendments to the Canadian
Wheat Board Act have corne to this chamber,
as they have over the past thirteen or fourteen years, they have always received more
serious consideration than in the lower house.
The reason is, I think, that there are in this
house honourable senators who have an intimate knowledge and an active understanding
of what is involved. That is particularly true
of the debate now taking place. The sincere
and genuine observations by the honourable
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
have added much to the debate. I heartily
agree with much of what he has had to say
about the freedom and liberty of the individual to market his grain. I do not intend
to argue the matter with him, for I believe he
is entitled to the wholehearted respect of
every honourable senator for the forthright
way in which he has expressed his viewpoint.
I wish to deal briefly with this bill from
the standpoint of what a government in a
country like Canada is expected to do in
matters of this kind. If time permitted, I
should have reviewed the historical evolution of the entire problem of Wheat Board
marketing since the closing years of the first
war. But it is sufficient to say that the whole
disturbance of what might be called the
normal way of marketing grain originated
with the appointment of the first Wheat
Board in the middle of the year 1919 to take
care of the 1919-20 crop.
As a result of the experiences of those
days, when wheat brought an average price of
$2.65 a bushel, the farmers of Western
Canada fell into a twofold illusion which not
only influenced the progress of events over
the succeeding ten years, but influenced the
course of political views in Western Canada
68112-31

for the ensuing thirty years. The twofold
illusion of which I speak was, first, that
high prices were associated with Wheat
Boards and government administration of
marketing; and, second, that through such
boards the producer was entitled to command
the world price of wheat.
That illusion persisted over the period
from 1920 to 1930. Then came the great
depression, which brought severe distress
and hardship to the people of the Prairie
provinces, and lead them to think that there
was something wrong with the system under
which they had previously lived. Formerly
they had boasted of their individual enterprise, took pride in their own efforts, and
asked nothing but the opportunity to buy
and sell where they wanted to. In a short
time they were converted to the viewpoint
that the government must stand as a guide
and protector to give them the security they
needed in their distress.
But to philosophize at this time about
the advantages of freedom and liberty under
those conditions, is of little moment to the
facts in the case.
Before 1935, as a result of the conditions I
have mentioned, the government of the day
decided, as the senator from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) has said, to take control of the
marketing of wheat from the hands of the
pool and give it to the first Wheat Board,
under the chairmanship of Mr. John I.
McFarland.
The result of his operations
against the trend of the times did not show
a profit. The government changed in 1935,
with the result that new personnel came
into the Wheat Board and there was a change
of policy. The board decided to liquidate the
wheat surplus and get out of controIled
government marketing. The Turgeon Commission was appointed by the King government for the purpose of investigating the
whole problem of marketing, and particularly
that phase of it related to option trading in
Winnipeg. The commission studied the matter for two years, travelled widely and looked
at marketing schemes the world over, and
made a report recommending open trading
and resumption of option trading on the
Winnipeg Grain Exchange.
No action was taken on the strength of that
report, the reason being that the opposition
of the farmers of Western Canada, supported
for the most part by. the eastern provinces,
made itself felt in the House of Commons.
It was so vigorous and its influence on parliament was so effective that no change was
ever made. True, the Wheat Board did not
function very actively until the outbreak of
war in 1939, but it then went into action.

SENATE
I have in my hand a list of the amendments,
of which thp nresent bill is the ninth, since
the Wheat Board Act of 1935 was introduced;
so that I cannot quite agree with my honourable friend from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
when he said-or I so understood him-that
the element of compulsion in connection with
this agreement dates from 1946 or 1947, when
the Wheat Board became an agency of the
Crown. It is true that prior to that time the
Wheat Board was a producers' organization,
but the elements of compulsion were present
in it from the beginning.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: In the Wheat Board?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: In connection with the
Wheat Board legislation.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Oh, after 1943.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I understood the honourable senator to say that the compulsion
feature attached to the board only when it
became an agency of the Crown.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: No, the compulsory feature
was present, under the orders of the Warýtime
Prices and Trade Board-applicable generally
across Canada-until the present Wheat Board
Act was passed, in 1947.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I am indebted to the
honourable senator for what he said but I
maintain that ever since 1935, and even
earlier, Wheat Board legislation contained
an element of compulsion. In 1939 an amendment was adopted which imposed a limit of
5,000 bushels on the quantity of wheat which
any one producer could sell to the board, and
provided that the producer delivering wheat
should receive an advance of 70 cents per
bushel; it also made the provisions of the
act applicable to wheat produced in the
eastern as well as the western divisions. From
that time, although the board was supposed to
exist solely for the purpose of serving the
producer, there was in it an increasing
measure of compulsion. The reason it finally
became an agency of the Crown was, I believe,
to enable it to control every phase of the
movement of grain pursuant to the British
wheat agreement. In passing, I may say
that personally I was critical of that legislation, and I still regard it as a very poor business deal. What I am trying to make clear
is that successive governments, of eilther political colour, from the beginning of the
thirties, have responded very definitely to the
overwhelming demand and desi're of the
western producers for this security, which
they think is preferable to the monetary
returns they might otherwise receive.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Because they were
looking for stability.

Hon. Mr. Lamber: Well, stability, security,
whatever you like to call it. The question
whether a government is jUiiC

na

to any group, "You do not know your own
business, and we are going to lead you along
another path and do things which you should
be better able to do for yourselves" raises
a basic problem of democratic government, but
I do not suppose that any government's tenure
of office would last long if it followed that
course. I am going to quote ýsomething which
was said by a gentleman who used to lead
the other side of this house, the Right Honourable Arthur Meighen. I am sure that his
opinion in connection with this kind of situation will carry a good deal of weight with
my honourable friend from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) as well as other honourable senators. He said:
Where there is a mandate for legislation which
comes before the Senate, where such legislation has
been clearly d'iscussed and placed on the political
platforms of the successful party in an election,
then only in most exceptional circumstances should
there be any attempt or desire on the part of the
Upper House to refuse to implement such legislation by its concurrence.

He further stated:
It is enough to emphasize the fact that authority
lies behind a popular mandate which the Senate
never can ignore, and that only under very special
circumstances should that chamber, even for purposes only of delay, fail to comply with an electoral
judgment.

After twenty years marked by a succession
of legislative amendments, the present bill is
clearly intended to establish the permanency
of the Wheat Board.
The members of the board will be known
as commissioners of the Wheat Board, much
as the members of the Board of Grain Commissioners are known as commissioners of
that board, and the life of the board is
extended, with all the powers heretofore
vested in its members, for another four years.
I submit that, in view of the attitude on this
question which has been taken by the people
of this country and their representatives in
the other place, where this bill passed without
an adverse vote, and with practical unanimity,
the Senate should approve this bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill waS
read the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The honourable senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) suggested
that the bill might be referred to committee.
If he insists on that course, I have no objection to it.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: No, I do not insist. I had

SENATE

Honourable senators, this treaty is quite
a iorward stop m hi field of intrnational
co-operation. This is the first time in the
history of the world that one nation has
agreed to respect the fishing rights of another
nation, or other nations, in the open sea
and beyond territorial waters.
The treaty is to run for eleven years. It
may be amended after five years, but only
if it can be shown that Canada and the
United States are not protecting the three
species of fish either by legal regulation or
scientific management, or because Canada
and the United States are not fully fishing
the salmon, halibut and herring resources in
these waters. We can be assured, however,
that Canada and the United States will continue to fish salmon, halibut and herring in
the North Pacific.
Some criticism has been made of the treaty
by those who advocate that Canada should
have extended her territorial waters and
defined them in this treaty. It should be
pointed out that Canada's territorial waters
have always been recognized, if not defined,
as the three-mile limit. The extension of
our territorial waters certainly could not have
been carried out under a bill or treaty of
this kind.
There has been a lot of loose thinking and
loose talking lately about territorial waters,
and by their speeches many people seem to
indicate there is an international law governing territorial waters. My study of international law and the freedom of the seas and
of territorial waters has shown me that there
simply is no agreement whatsoever amongst
the various countries of the world regarding
the extent of territorial waters. On the other
hand, freedom of the seas is recognized by
all nations. The doctrine of the three-mile
limit was a doctrine inaugurated by the
British and later adopted by the United
States, and, of course, foll-owed or adhered
to by Canada, Australia and New Zealand
and the British colonies generally. Outside
of Great Britain, United States, Canada and
countries of the British Empire, who naturally followed Great Britain, all other countries of the world have asserted and claimed
greater distances from their shores than that
of three miles, the old cannonball distance.
Russia, for instance, claims an exclusive
fishery on the Pacifie Coast for from twelve
to fourteen miles, and in some areas 50 miles.
Some countries claim four, some six, some
again claim eight miles. Five countries in
Europe with a coastline of over 4,000 miles
all claim greater distances than that 'of three
miles, and all Latin American countries
claim even greater distances from their
shores than six miles.

There is no one matter so likely to raise
frictinn hetween countries as that of fisheries
in the open seas; and it is just as well at

this point to mention that controversies over
common fishing grounds have threa;tened
international peace for well over three centuries. As a matter of historical fact, there
was no such doctrine as freedom of the seas
until piracy ultimately came to an end,
some two hundred years ago. The problems
of fishing and fisheries in the open seas are
under discussion by the United Nations at
the present time, and a committee bas been
set up to study the open seas and the rights
of nations on them. I am sorry that Canada
has no direct delegate on that committee.
Here is what they have to say in their latest
report:
On the high seas adjacent to its territorial waters,
the coastal state may exercise the control necessary
to prevent the infringement, within its territory or
territorial waters, of its customs, fiscal or sanitary
regulations. Such control may not be exercised
more than twelve miles from the coast.

May I point out that Canada has extended
her jurisdiction for customs purposes to
some twelve miles, in accordance with the
paragraph I have just read.
I again quote from the report of the United
Nations:
The proposed contiguous zones are not intended
for purposes of security or of exclusive fishing
rights. in 1930, the Preparatory Committee of the
Codification Conference found that the replies from
governments offered no prospect of reaching agreement to extend beyond territorial waters the exclusive rights of coastal states in the matter of fishing.
The commission considers that in that respect the
position has not changed.

I understand a committee bas been set up
by the government to examine the matter

of Canada's territorial waters. It would be
a mistake, I believe, to place this matter
before the United Nations. It is my opinion
that the chief objection confronting any pro-

posed enlargement of Canada's three-mile
limit now in effect would not be from
European foreign countries, but rather from
Great Britain and the United States, both of
which countries would no doubt protest,
particularly as they would ibe faced with a
complete right-about-face in this matter,
especially after so long a national policy of
complete freedom of the seas outside territorial waters jurisdiction. They might, therefore, be against any enlargement or extension
of Canada's three-mile limit, particularly if
fishing rights were involved.
If any extension of Canada's territorial
waters is decided upon by the government
after the committee's report, this should be
donc, in my opinion, by a simple definite
announcement to all other countries of any
such proposed change, and I doubt very much
if any country would seriously violate such

APRIL 23, 1953
territorial limits claimed. Canada has already
laid claim to a distance of twelve miles offshore from low tide for customs purposes
only, and should now increase her territorial
jurisdiction for preventing pollution of sea
waters by oil or chemicals. One company in
the state of Washington wanted to put a
chemical called arsenic trioxide into the
Puget Sound waters; and it has been recommended to the authorities that this material
be placed in cement and taken out to sea,
because if it were dumped into the open
waters within at least three miles it would
kill the fish that came into contact with it.
While on the subject of examining Canada's
territorial rights, I may say that I · hink that
t
when dealing with territorial waters the
dominion should give some consideration to
provincial rights with respect to oil wells
three miles out. Any one who has t.ravelled
south into the United States and seen oil
wells away out in the water will realize how
valuable these rights can be. Since the
provinces have control of all land, and as
the land continues out under the water, I
think they could very well claim the oil
rights in the territorial waters. Bear in mind
that in the past all other nations of the world
have simply announced their claim or right
to territorial jurisdiction extending to three,
four, six, eight or twelve miles, as the case
may be, and these rights have generally been
respected and never seriously challenged by
any other nation. Any danger would only
arise if Canada, the United States or any
other country endeavoured to maintain claims
to off-shore waters in the open seas for
fisheries. In support of this statement one has
only to examine the United Nations report
I have just read and look at the consideration
which has been given to the matter by the
committee set up under the United Nations
Assembly.
During the debate on this bill in the House
of Commons a question was raised as to
Hecate Strait, that area of water which lies
between the mainland of British Columbia
and Queen Charlotte Islands, an extremely
valuable fishing area. The Queen Charlotte
Islands consist of two large islands and a
number of smaller islands situated at the
northern tip some 30 or 35 miles from the
mainland. United States fishermen have for
many years fished these waters in Hecate
Strait, but the right of Americans to fish
has not always been recognized by Canada.
On two occasions in the House of Commons,
when I was a member there, I took the
matter up; and I understand that the matter
is now being considered by a committee set
up by the government.
I should like to point out briefly that in the
years 1906 and 1907 Canada chased American

fishing vessels out of those waters, claiming
that they were strictly Canadian waters. The
Americans at that time made no protest whatever, but simply left for home. That happened
over a two-year period, but no further attention has been paid to the matter.
I am of the opinion-and I should like to
check this with the records of that timethat the hand of Great Britain entered into
that affair. She has always fought to maintain the freedom of the seas and the threemile territorial limit. At that time Canada
was only a colony, though a promising one,
and Great Britain was no doubt consulted
and advised accordingly.
I am not now suggesting that we should
chase the Americans out of these waters, but
I advocate that the time has come when Canada should approach the American authorities
and point out that these are Canadian waters
in which Americans may fish only by virtue
of a licence or permit. For the peace of the
world I think we should have some such
understanding with our American neighbours.
In support of that belief I should like to
point out that Russia at one time claimed
fishing rights in the whole Pacific Ocean. She
had naval and military locations as far south
as San Francisco. Just last year there passed
through the Panama Canal thirty-three Soviet
trawlers and one mother ship headed for the
North Pacific. If the Russians decided to come
down and fish off our shores in Hecate Strait
and we protested, they would have every right
to point to the fact that we have allowed the
Americans to fish there with impunity. But
if we entered into such an arrangement with
the United States as I suggest-that is by way
of some licensing scheme-Canada would
have no difficulty in supporting her position.
If, however, Canada's position were later
challenged, the matter could be placed before
the International Court of Justice. Norway
recently placed a somewhat similar set of circumstances before that court by way of a
complaint against British fishermen trespassing on her waters. The court supported Norway's contention, and a line was drawn from
one point of land to another in Norway-I
understand at one spot it is a distance of forty
miles from shore-within which British fishermen may not now fish.
I come back now to the treaty itself. I have
some doubts whether under the treaty the
commission is empowered to set up its own
scientific staff with the object of obtaining
reliable scientific information required and
necessary for the carryng out of that treaty.
I refer particularly to information on the
intermingling of salmon in the North Pacific
waters of the Bering Sea. If under the treaty
it .is found that the commission has to obtain
such information from scientific organizations

SENATE

wvll strt

off at a disadvantage. Japan has more scientifie information on the fisheries of the North
Pacific than has either the United States or
Canada. Canada, as a matter of fact, has no
such information as is required under the
treaty. I have on many occasions in the past
brought this fact to the attention of the government, but no notice has so far been taken
of it. The matter of finding out where the
salmon in the Bering Sea or Bristol Bay go
to spawn is one of the important questions of
the treaty, and is second only in importance
to the clauses which protect Canada's three
most important fisheries on the Pacific from
exploitation by Japan.
It must always be borne in mind that previous to the outbreak of the last war Japan had
conducted a most extensive scientific research
in the Bristol Bay and Bering Sea waters;
and, but for the intervention of the war,
Japan might by this time have completed
her scientific investigations in those areas not
only as to salmon but as to all species of fish,
including crabs and ground fish.
I understand that the United States bas
for some time been busy conducting a scientific research in this area; but Canada, as I
have said, has no such information and it
is problematical whether she could obtain it
without a great deal of expense. Certainly
it would take time. However, Canada is
not at the present time greatly interested in
fishing in either Bristol Bay or the Bering
Sea; as has already been mentioned, she is
protected against exploitation of her three
important fisheries on the North Pacific.
It should be pointed out that with the
freedom of the seas universally recognized
by international law, but for this treaty

there would be nothing to prevent the Japanese from fishing these waters for salmon,
hnihut nr herring.

I believe this important

fact should be given more publicity than it
has received so far. This is the first treaty
of its kind in all the history of mankind,
and is therefore a new and forward step
in international affairs affecting the rights of
nations to certain fisheries in the open seas.
The further fact that such a treaty has been
signed by three nations may well deter or
prevent other nations from entering these
offshore fisheries.
The treaty in all its phases bas been passed
by both the United States and Japan, and
the setting up of the commission awaits only
the passage of this measure through the
Senate.
Each country may under the treaty appoint
four commissioners, but each country will
have only one vote on matters to be decided.
In conclusion, may I say that this historymaking treaty points the way to a rational
solution of the open seas fishery problems in
many parts of the world today.
Honourable senators, as the treaty has
already been before the Senate, it may not
be necessary to refer this bill to a committee.

CANADA WATER CONSERVATION
ASSISTANCE BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from Tuesday, April

21, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Gershaw for the second reading of
Bill 109, an Act to authorize the grant of
assistance to a province for the conservation
of water resources.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators, as
pointed out by the mover of the second reading (Hon. Mr. Gershaw), the purpose of this
bill is primarily to assist provincial governments to conserve water supplies and to
reduce hazards of floods.
Four federal
measures along somewhat similar lines are
already in effect: the Canada Forestry Act, the

Maritime Marshland Rehabilitation Act, the
Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act, and the
Eastern Rocky Mountain Forest Conservation
Act. I believe there are also one or two others
of some importance.
Under this measure the municipalities are
called upon to pay 25 per cent of the cost,
with the remaining 75 per cent to be paid by
the provincial and federal governments. This
legislation will undoubtedly be of assistance
to all provinces-particularly British Columbia, whose people have been requesting some
such assistance as has been provided for
some time now to other provinces.
Honourable senators, may I point out that
the great salmon industry of British Columbia could be entirely destroyed if legislative
measures for the conservation of water and
the building of dams to prevent floods is not
put into effect. I fully realize that legislation
affecting fish comes under a different department and minister than does the bill now
before us. However, that is no reason why
the attention of the government and other
ministers should not be drawn to the dangers
facing the salmon in the interior streams and
lakes of British Columbia, should schemes
to preserve watersheds, and for forest conservation, irrigation and dams to prevent
flooding, as provided for in this bill, be proceeded with, without regard to the effects such
schemes may have on the spawning beds in
the various streams, rivers and lakes where
the salmon are born and where they live and
grow for eighteen months before proceeding
out to sea.
British Columbia, as everyone knows, is
alive and bustling with new developments,
and industrialists with millions to invest are
seeking a part and share in our great natural
heritage of timber, metals, gas, oil and water
power. We should not, however, overlook
the fact that the products of our fishing
grounds are still extremely important for the
present and future well-being of Canada.
These constitute a very valuable supply of
food, and it cannot be denied that food is
today more important than ever especially
because of the ever increasing world population. Last year British Columbia's salmon
fishery was valued at some $84 million. And
may I say that the total value of its production in the past 40 years is some $500 million,
compared with a total production of around
$450 million from gold mines in the province
over a period of more than twice as longnamely, in 90 odd years, or since the first
gold rush in British Columbia.
Perhaps someone may ask at this point:
but what can the dominion government do in
this matter, since under the British North
America Act the provinces have the sole right

we need power and we need fish. We need fish
because this sad old world of ours needs all the

If we need both power and fish it seems to us
that it is the duty of the government-the government and not the government's power commission
-to decide the issue on the cold, hard economic
facts. The decision should be made after the
experts have given their evidence. It should be
made with a view to the future of this province
and of Canada.
In the meantime do not let us be led astray in our
thinking by vague assurances and claims that are
put forth with such earnest enthusiasm.

But what will be the effect if the scheme is

Last week we had the surprising announcement
from Premier Bennett that the B.C. provincial
government and the federal government are going
ahead with the hard-surfacing of the Big Bend
highway, on a magnificent scale, to have it take
its place as a part of the Trans-Canada highway.
This decision is made in the face of the fact that
within five or ten years the entire roadbed will
probably be wiped out by the erection of the Mica

any such obstacle they will travel along the
channels built by power shovel machinery
and perish there because of the insufficiency
of water. Steps must therefore be taken
to provide screens at the mouth of these
canals. This, may I say, has been done in the
state of Washington.
As regards reforestation: logging companies, naturally, are interested; but there is
another aspect to logging operations which is
important to salmon. We find companies
cutting down timber and then dragging their
logs right through the gravel bars, with the
result that many spawning beds have been
destroyed. No great interest seems to be
taken in the effects of this practice, which
may I say, are causing great damage to our
fisheries.
My suggestion to the government is that it
set up a separate authority representing the
Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Board and
the Departments of Agriculture, Fisheries, and
Resources and Development, and that the
provincial governments be approached, either
immediately after the election or before it,
with a request for legislation similar to that
which has been passed in the state of Washington. It is truc that the Washington law
was enacted somewhat late, and the state's
action may be likened to locking the door after
half the horses have been stolen, but the
law itself is a good one. One provision
worthy of note is that no construction work
which may affect the fisheries may be undertaken until it has been referred to the fisheries
authorities.
The dominion Fisheries Act
gives us in this respect little or no protection.
Any damage done is donc before the law
can be invoked. The act was placed on
the statute books approximately forty years
ago, and is now out of date, as may be
judged from the fact that anyone found guilty
of acts resulting in the destruction of fish
is liable only to a penalty of not less than
$4 nor more than $20 a day during the period
that a governmental order to make some
repairs or build some hatchery or fishery
around the dam is not complied with.
The situation with respect to the Aluminum
Company, to which I referred at the beginning
of my remarks, did not come under this act.
The Aluminum Company knew this and for
a long time they defied the federal authorities.
I think the Fisheries Act should be revised
and brought up to date in the light of this
country's
hydro-electric
and
industrial
development, and I understand the Honourable Minister of Fisheries has this in
mind.
In conclusion, I suggest that every branch of
government, before being allowed to proceed
with any project, should find out from the
Department of Fisheries whether it would

cause harm to our great fishing industry in
British Columbia, and to the spawning beds in
that province.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
we are indebted to the honourable gentleman
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) for
what be has brought to our attention this
afternoon, but this legislation does not contemplate a structure such as he has in mind.
First of all, the bill sets a ceiling on the
amount the federal government may contribute towards the cost of any structure; and
fish and game will definitely be protected during the carrying out of any work.
The honourable gentleman said that irrigation systems destroy wild life. But the very
opposite has happened in at least one irrigated
area. Fish and wild game have been p'rotected
there and have thrived, and fishing and hunting have become valuable industries in the
locality. I really believe that the departmental officials will see to it that fish and
wild life are protected under this legislation.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I hope so.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Lambert: Honourable senators,
ordinarily I would suggest that this bill be
sent to the Standing Committee on Natural
Resources. However, a large number of senators are regularly attending sittings of the
Banking and Commerce Committee, which
just now has before it a heavy volume of
important legislation, and it might be advisable to add this measure to that committee's
agenda. Therefore, if it is agreeable to the
house, I move that the bill be referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.

Yesterday afternoon during the debate an

Act we were regaied by references to governmental and economnic assistance ta certain
classes of aur people. Frankly, I do flot think
the honourable senator fromn Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) and the honourable leader o! the
apposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) are sufficiently
aware a! what has been happening in the hast
twenty-five or thirty years.
Originally I was palitically and economically a member of the Manchester schaol of
economists, which, based an free trade and
the theary o! laisser-faire-the idea that
people should be allowed ta do as they wishheld that in order ta bring about the greatest
good for the greater number there should be
no interference with private initiative. That
was the age -of the rugged individualist.
Now this has entirely changed. The first
intimation on a theoretical basis came in a
book entitled Economic Consequences of the
Treaty of Versailles, written by the great
British economist, Keynes. He outlined the
theory that the economic sanctions impased
on Germany after the First Great War were
impossible of fulfilment, and that prosperity
couid only be achieved by government spending, even on a deficit basis. Untortunately he
lived in an era of fair prasperity. That prosperous period was fohhowed by the greatest
ecanomic crisis of ail history. There came
inta power in the United States a government which immediately started ta put into
farce, on an experimental basis, the theory -of
the Keynesian school af economists--"government spending for prasperity".
Nowadays in the United States you have

Centra] Mortgage and Housing, raiiway
freight rates, and SQ on. And we now have
befare us Bill 329, an Act ta amend the
Emergency Gold Mining Assistance Act.
Ail these measures are of a similar pattern,
and their eff ect is ta make Canada a welfare
state, a social democracy. A lot of economic
theorists in this country and other places do
not mention this. However, that does not
vitiate the fact. Over and above all this,
and by no means the least, is the government-awned Bank of Canada, the guardian
and watch dog of aur credit and currency
system. I will nat dweli on the central bank
at this time, except ta say that it is the one
governmental. institution that contrais our
ecanomic balance wheel.
Canada is nat the only democracy which
is operating on a wclfare basis. It is ridiculous ta advocate taday the aid theary of the
Manchester school. Everybady now wants
co-aperative action an national and international prablems. 1 think we have been subj ected long enough ta some of these ancient
fallacies, without registering pratest, and I
take this opportunity ta, say that I do not
believe in them. I think we might as wefl
name them and caîl them what they are. If
the welfare state cantinues ta develop, as
today's Order Paper indicates it wili, we
shall neyer abandon the co-operative functions of modern govemnment.
The purpose of the bill before us is ta
amend the Emergency C aid Mining Assistance Act. In large measure gold mines
enjoy their greatest prosperity in depression
years. For the purpose of maintaining a
possible future consumption of materiais produced in Canada in times of depression we
have, in a paternalistic way, given assistance
ta gold mines in the past, meanwhile maintaining the communities and technical personnel on a possibly expansive foundatian.
This is nat a new bill. Its principle has
been in operation for several years, and to
date has only been changed by inconsequential amendments.
Up ta the present trne, we have been
spending about $10J million per annum for
the assistance of gald mining. Now it is
proposed ta, make it $15 million. On account
of the rise in the cost of production last year
and the appreciatian i the exchange value
of the Canadian dollar, the goid mining
industry's returns from sales have decreased.
Meanwhile, the costs of aperation are mounting. Now, under aur system of a welfare
state-social democracy-we have ta maintain the cammunities in aur times. There
is nothing new in the bill. It is going

has had such success is that it bas been
directed not by scientists but by a layman.
Ample proof could be produced that scientists and biologists must be under the direction of practical men, otherwise they may
spend a lifetime and find out little or nothing.
My suggestion to the government is that
they appoint a layman as chairman of this
board. Where would you find more capable
men than the Minister of Fisheries and his
deputy? Yet neither of them is a scientist.
The trouble with scientists-I was going to
say doctors and lawyers tooHon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: -is that they are too clannish, and apt to protect one another. I do
not say this in any carping sense, but I
am disturbed about the prospects of having a
board that is overbalanced with scientists
who chiefly come, not from the Pacific or
Atlantic coast, but from interior sections of
Canada.
I recall a visit I once paid to the Fisheries
Research headquarters at Nanaimo, where I
saw a scientist working away at some experiment. I approached him and asked him
what he was doing. He replied that he was
testing sea water. Upon being asked what
he was testing it for, he told me that it was
for salinity, and that he had been testing sea
water for salinity over a period of ten or
twelve years. He admitted that he could
not tell me anything about plankton and such
properties of the water on which fish live.
Here was a man who had been simply testing
water for salinity over a period of ten years
and still had no findings to report. And I
can point to other employees of the Fisheries
Research Board who are about as unproductive as that man was.
Although the board bas done much valuable
work, I am anxious to see it do still better.
So I repeat my suggestion to the governinent
that they do not appoint a scientist to the
position of chairman, but rather that they
appoint a layman with practical qualities
such as those of the Minister of Fisheries
or his deputy. What success the salmon commission has had so far has been due in part

at least to the direction of six laymen who
have told the scientists what was wanted to
be done, and reminded them "We are not
going to wait twenty or thirty years for the
answers; we want them this year or next."
In that way the scientists were kept on the
line and thereby accomplished something.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable
senators, my knowledge of fisheries, like that
of the honourable senator from Thunder Bay
(Hon. Mr. Paterson), is limited to fly fishing
in a trout stream, just as my knowledge of
wild life is limited to an interest in "Ducks
Unlimited". But it is difficult for me to
accept altogether the castigation by my bonourable friend from New Westminster (Hon.
Mr. Reid) of the responsible heads of the
Department of Fisheries for any shortcomings
on the part of the Research Board.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I have found no fault with
the heads of the department. What fault
there is has been on the part of the Research
Board.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Special reference was
made to the Deputy Minister of Fisheries.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I said he was capable of
doing his job.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Then I must have misunderstood my friend.
We are all aware of the fact that there has
been marked development on the part of the
government, and a growth in public opinion,
as to the marketing of fish in Canada, particularly the fresh salt-water fish coming
from either coast. I have some knowledge of
the biological problems affecting fresh water
fish, such as the Winnipeg goldeye and the
tullibee, whieh are caught in Lake Winnipeg,
and I am satisfied that the scientists have
faced tremendous tasks in trying to counteraet
the infestation of these fish by microbes.
Similar problems exist further east in connection with the victimizing of white fish and
trout in the fresh water lakes by the growing
population of eels. These problems justify
the expansion of the scientific force of the
Department of Fisheries. There are good
scientists and poor ones; and I suppose that
in this respect workers in this departinent are
no different from those in any other. They
must be directed, and their efforts intensified
and increased, in order to serve the growing
demands and needs of the people of this
country for the consumption of fish.
There is the other very important point of
the infiltration of impure matter into the
streams and lakes of this country.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Pollution.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Yes. Here, again, science
can be of great value in bringing some people
to their senses with regard to that evil.

his contention that the administrative heads

as strongly as I can the contribution of our
scientists. I do not know much about fisheries,
but there is one subject on which I claimwhether the claim be accepted or not-to

the work of our scientific men there would be
today no wheat crops worth mentioning in the
West or any other part of Canada. The
laboratory work at Winnipeg in the past fifty
years in behalf of the wheat producers of this
country is beyond price. When rust struck
the prairies in the early thirties, our grain
growers were helpless, but the research
chemists came to our aid and solved the problem by breeding a rust-resistant wheat. True,
as time went on the resistant qualities
decreased; but new strains were evolved and
the difficulty was overcome. The present
Minister of Agriculture, as the head of the
department responsible for dealing with problems of wheat production, saw to it that scientific attention was directed to such matters,
and I give him due credit for it; but that
should not obscure the fact that, without the
hard and persistent work of the scientists
themselves, those problems would not have
been solved.

PRAIRIE FARM ASSISTANCE

BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. Norman P. Lambert moved the second
reading of Bill 333, an Act to amend the
Prairie Farm Assistance Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
very short bill. It deals with a class of
lands which, under the provisions of the act
of 1939, if they were sold after December 31,
1940, are not eligible for award. The first
purpose of the amendments, therefore, is to
make those lands eligible for assistance under
the Prairie Farm Assistance Act. The second
purpose is to provide that a lease containing
an option to sell is to be regarded as an
agreement for sale; and by this interpretation

from the beginning, so I have no objection
to the passage of the bill now before the
house. The district from which I come bas
never required much assistance under this
act, but the farmers of neighbouring districts
where the land is not too good and rainfall
has not been too plentiful have benefited
greatly from the legislation. I think that
the area which has recently been settled
in the northern part of the province should
come under the act, despite the fact it
receives more rainfall than does the Palliser
triangle. A great deal of land in that area
has been leased or sold to veterans since 1945,
but the benefits of this bill do not appear to
extend to them.
As I understand section 2 of the bill, lands
leased prior to December 31, 1940, under a
lease option agreement, will be eligible for
award under the act even though the option
is not taken up until after that date.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Apparently, however,
none of the areas sold or leased since the
war are included. Perhaps the mover could
give the house some information on that
point, or move to have the bill referred to
committee, where detailed information could
be furnished to honourable senators.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I believe these veterans'
settlements are included in the lands which
come under the Prairie Farm Assistance Act,
but if the house sees fit to give this measure
second reading I shall move to have it
referred to committee, where definite information on these questions can be given.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

VETERANS BENEFIT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. Lambert moved the second reading of Bill 335, an Act to amend the Veterans
Benefit Act, 1951.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is simply to extend for another
year the provisions of the Veterans Benefit
Act, 1951. When this legislation was originally passed, in 1951, it was provided that
it should expire on the last day of the first
session of Parliament, 1952, and last year
the provisions of the bill were extended to
the last day of the first session of parliament,
1953. The purpose of the act is to provide
Korean veterans with benefits comparable
to those received by veterans of the last
Great War. Under the act some 9,474 gratuities have been paid to Korean veterans to
date, and so far re-establishment credits have
been set up for 9,046 Korean veterans. At
the present time approximately 150 Korean
veterans are in universities or vocational
training schools. Passage of this bill would
make the benefits under the act available for
another year.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

money with which to meet the living expenses
of themselves, and, in some instances, of their
wives and children. In our larger cities, such
as Montreal, Toronto, and Winnipeg, there are
many people who are making great contributions to such professions as the law and medicine who, but for the benefits received from
veterans' legislation, could not be where they
are today.
I believe, honourable senators, that no finer
investment of our country's money was ever
made than in the education of our returned
soldiers from World War IL. What was said
in support of that legislation can equally well
be said about this bill to provide benefits for
the higher education of the children of soldiers
who made the supreme sacrifice in the service of their country.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: The title of this bill is
"An Act to provide assistance for the higher
education of children of certain deceased
members of the armed forces and of other
persons." May I ask the honourable senator
who are the "other persons"?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I shal perhaps touch on
that phase of the bill in my later remarks,
but it applies to nursing sisters and others
who strictly speaking might not be regarded
as members of the armed forces.
I may say that at the present time about
12,000 children are receiving payments under
schedule B of the Pensions Act. That schedule
gives the list of those entitled to the benefits
under the act, including widows and their
children who are now receiving a pension.
The Department of Veterans Affairs estimates
that the peak, so far as pension payments for
World War Il are concerned, will be reached
in the period between 1958 and 1962.
Candidates who qualify under the provisions of this bill will receive a training allowance while they are in full attendance at
properly designated educational institutions,
plus payment of their tuition fees. I shall
mention the benefits when I discuss the bill
clause by clause.
Briefly, honourable senators, the purpose
of the bill is to provide financial assistance
for higher education of the pensioned sons
and daughters of former members of the
forces who died as a result of their service.
I shall now deal quickly with the bill clause
by clause.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: May I first ask a question? Will my honourable friend tell the
house if these benefits are to be paid to
people whether they need them or not, without any kind of means test? Also, will he
tell us how many persons are likely to be
affected and what the annual cost will be?

Hon. Mr. Isnor: May I be permitted to cover
those points as I deal with the bill in detail?
I am sure in that way my friend will get a
complete answer to his question.
Paragraph (a) of section 2, the interpretation section, defines "Educational institution";
and paragraph (b) designates the "minister"
as the Minister of Veterans Affairs. Paragraph (c) defines "student" as,
(1) a child on whose behalf a pension is being
paid pursuant to any of the enactments set out in
schedule A of this act in respect of a person who
served in the naval, army or air forces of Canada
in the war that commenced in August, 1914, or in
the war that commenced in September, 1939.
(ii)a child on whose behalf a pension is being
paid, pursuant to or by virtue of any of the enactments set out in schedle B ...
Briefly, it includes all children in respect of
whom a pension is now being paid; and as
I said a moment ago, they number about

12,000. It is of course unlikely that the
entire 12,000 will take advantage of a higher
education. Statistics show that about 60 per
cent of the students reach a certain grade,
and only 10 per cent take what we call higher
education. So that out of the 12,000, perhaps
1,200 will enter university. However, provision is made for assistance for persons training in the trades.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: The honourable gentleman
referred to children of veterans of World
War I. Would they not by now have passed
the educational stage of their lives?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: The bill provides that candidates may make application for assistance
within fifteen months after this bill becomes
law. As to veterans of World War II, it is
readily apparent that boys who entered the
army as early as seventeen or eighteen years
of age will still be young enough to take
advantage of educational benefits.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: The honourable gentleman misunderstood my question. I had
reference particularly to veterans of the First
World War.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: All I can say is that the
act applies to children of pensioners from
both the first and second world wars.
By section 4 of the bill provision is made
for payment of a monthly allowance of $25
during the period in which the student is
attending a full-time course of study in an
educational institution. In addition, the
tuition fees on the average would be about
$300. The total of those two items, calculated
on a term of eight or nine months, would
amount to an annual outlay per student of
from $500 to $550. I trust that is, in part at
least, an answer to the question asked by
the senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine).

SENATE
I have already mentioned that a candidate
shall apply for benefits within fifteen months
after the coming into effect ot nis act. By
subsection (3) of section 6 the time may be
extended. That subsection reads:
The minister may extend the periods prescribed
by this section where he is satisfied that because
of ill health or any other good cause the student
was unable to resume or commence a course of
education or instruction in an educational institution within the time limited by this section.

That will protect any candidate who otherwise might, through no fault of his own,
be deprived of these benefits.
A limitation to which some reference was
made in the other place appears in the
clause which states that no allowance or costs
shall be paid in respect of a student who,
having failed in one or more classes or subjects in any academic year, fails in more than
one of the supplementary examinations in any
such subjects. We know what took place
during the rehabilitation period. A great
many ex-service men, attracted by the prospects in the medical profession, decided they
wanted to be doctors and, after one or two
attempts, failed to pass their examinations.
It was thought not to be to the national
advantage, nor perhaps in the best interests

of the soldiers themselves, that they be
allowed to continue their studies along that
line, and they turned their attention to the
engineering or the legal profession, after having failed in medicine-assuming it is possible for one to make a success in the legal
profession after having failed in medicine!
But of course, under these circumstances,
men changed from one course to another and
continued their studies for the time being.
Section 10 provides that the Governor in
Council may make regulations to carry out
the purposes of the act. The last section,
clause 11, provides that the act shall come
into force on the lst day of July, 1953.
That, honourable senators, is the sectionby-section

background of the bill, which I

hope I have covered to your enlightenment
and satisfaction.
May I say, in closing, that the last bill I
had the privilege to present before this body
was one dealing with an institution bearing
the name of a veteran of World War I-the
Callow Veterans' and Invalids' Welfare
League-and I think it would be appropriate
at this time to express, on behalf of Walter
Callow, his gratitude for the support accorded
his bill by the members of this chamber.
Honourable members will be pleased to learn
that last Thursday Walter Callow was presented with his charter by the LieutenantGovernor of Nova Scotia, the Honourable

Alistair Fraser, on behalf of the Governor
General of Canada.
Some Hon. Senators: LHear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I did not hear the
honourable senator answer any of my questions.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I thought I answered them
one by one.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: My first question was,
bas he any information as to how many persons will be affected by and receive benefits
under this measure? The second question
was, do its benefits apply to every student,
whether he needs them or not, and without
any means test? My third question was, has
the sponsor any idea of what will be the
annual cost of this provision?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I must apologize to the
honourable senator for not having been able
to make myself as clear as I hoped to be.
I stated that at the present time 12,000 children enjoy the benefits arising under
schedule B of the bill. The estimate given
in the other place, and which I think is on
the low side, was that about 10 per cent of
them would try to take advantage of a higher
education. That, I think, is a fairly definite
answer to the first question.
My answer to the second question was that,
according to my information, university
tuition fees will amount to about $300 a year,
to which must be added the allowance of
$25 a month to each boy or girl who qualifies under the scheme. This would amount
to another $250 for ten months: actually an
academic year is about nine months. Adding
$300 and $250 gives a total of $550 for each
and every student. Multiply this amount by
1,200-that is, 10 per cent of the 12,000 I

have mentioned-and we have the answer.
To the third question, which I may have
overlooked, my reply is that there is no
means test. The act will apply to each and
every boy, girl and nurse now receiving a
grant from the government under schedule
B. In other words, it is a provision for the

children of the widows of a deceased soldier;
and I think its value will be better appreciated if one reflects on the difficulties which
face a widow with two or three children in
providing not only for the ordinary expenses
of the household and the upkeep of ber

children,

but

for

the

expenses

of

their

education.
It is in view of these circumstances that the government, responding to
the representations of various organizations,
decided to make this provision, in the form
of a grant which, as I have said, is estimated
to amount to about $550 for each and every
one of those qualified to receive it.

APRIL 24, 1953
Hon. Mr. Haig: I understood the honourable
member to say that, after World War II,
students who failed to pass the medical examinations turned to law and got through as
lawyers.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I may have said that, but
I did not intend thereby to imply, what apparently is in the mind of the distinguished
gentleman, the leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig), that there is in my mind any
difference between the capacities of a medical
man and a lawyer.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But did the honourable
senator say so?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I think I said something
along that line; but if I rephrase my remark
to reverse the situation, would he have any
objection?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I assume that it is intended
to send this bill to committee.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Of course, that is for the
acting leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Lambert) to say. As the bill received so
much publicity and unanimous support from
all sides in the other place I did not think it
would be necessary to send it to committee,
but that is not for me to decide.
Hon. Mr. Haig: In view of the fact that the
honourable senator has, in my judgment,
cast an aspersion on the legal profession, I
want to have the bill go to committee, so
that we may learn, by inquiry from the
principals of the universities of Canada, how
many men who failed to pass their examinations in medicine changed their course
of study and got through in law. I would
like to have that information, because I have
some pride in the legal profession. I do not
think we lawyers are the most intelligent
people in the world, but neither are we the
least intelligent. It seems to me the remark
is a serious aspersion on the legal profession,
and, it may be, as personified by myself and

my colleague from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), since we are the ones who have spoken
on the bill.
Hon. Mr. King: Those students merely went
into an easier profession!
Hon. Mr. Haig: In order that we may find
the facts from the principals of the universities, they should be summoned to bring their
records with them, to let us know how
many men failed to pass in medicine and
then passed in law. Also I would like the
gentlemen to tell us why; because, if law is
as easy a study as, in that event, it might
seem to be, it is time something was done
about it.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I would not like to leave
any wrong impression as to what was in my
mind. Because of my lack of legal training,
I may not have been able to express myself
as fluently or clearly as the honourable
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig); and
if I said anything which does not meet with
his approval, I at once apologize.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am not interested in
apologies. The honourable member has stated
something as a fact, and I am going to try
to prove that it is incorrect.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: There is no question in my
mind that a great number of students could
not pass their examinations, and for that
reason it was not deemed advisable that they
pursue their particular studies. Perhaps that
clarifies the situation as far as the legal
profession is concerned.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

TRIBUTES TO HIS MEMORY

On the Orders of the Day:
Norman

P.

Lamberi:

I regret very much that I shall be absent from
the Senate when references are made to the passing of our esteemed colleague, the Honourable
William Duff, of Lunenburg. I have requested the
acting leader (Hon. Mr. Lambert) to ask the indulgence of honourable senators in placing on the
record this word of tribute to Senator Duff's
memory.
My home and associations were in the particular
part of Nova Scotia with which Senator Duff's
business and political activities were long identified.
His many kindnesses to me personally when I first
came to the Senate will long be remembered by me.
I extend to the members of his family my deepest
sympathy in their bereavement.

To Senator Duff's more intimate friends
it was quite evident during his recent appearance in this chamber that in the loss of his
devoted wife some weeks earlier he had
received a mortal blow. The disappearance
now of both of them from these halls, after an
active attachment extending over some thirtysix years, may be likened to the removal of
an established landmark which has seemed
to become almost an inseparable part of a
familiar scene.
Senator Duff was to have celebrated his
eighty-first birthday tomorrow. Since he
was forty-five years of age he has been an
outstanding figure in parliament and in the
public life of his country.
Our late colleague was born at Carbonear,
Newfoundland, the son of Scottish parents
who had migrated there from the county of
Stirling, Scotland. He received his first
schooling in Newfoundland, but his secondary
education was taken at a well-known private
school named Blair Lodge, at Polmont, located
near Falkirk, Scotland, near his father's
birthplace.
Upon his return to Newfoundland he
worked with his father, who was a fish
merchant and who, incidentally, had spent
twelve years as a member of the legislative
assembly in that colony. In the year 1895, at
the age of twenty-three, our late colleague
went to live in Nova Scotia, first at Bridgewater and then at Lunenburg.

THE LATE SENATOR DUFF

Hon.

(Hon. Mr. Robertson), which he has asked
me to incorporate in any remarks made
tonight by way of tribute to the late Senatur
Duff. It reads:

Honourable

senators, it is my sad duty to refer to the
passing of our late colleague from Lunenburg,
the Honourable William Duff. I am sure
we were all saddened by the news of his
death which came suddenly to us over the
week-end.
I have in my hand a statement made by
the honourable leader of the government

His begin-

nings in business there were in the general
store of his father-in-law, and then in the
local weekly newspaper office, where be
learned to be a printer and to know well the
smell of printer's ink. From there be graduated into the business of shipping, and the
handling of fish, and over the years that
followed he did well and established a
successful industry.
After serving as Clerk and Treasurer and
Mayor of Lunenburg, William Duff made his
entry into federal politics, in 1917. With the

APRIL 27, 1953
exception of one year he was a member of
the House of Commons and the Senate ever
since that time.
Our late colleague was essentially a House
of Commons man. On the hustings and in
parliament, particularly during his nineteen
years as a member of the House of Commons,
he was an effective advocate of his party's
interests and a redoubtable opponent.
He
was colourful and at times vociferous, but he
had a real quality of mind which now and
and again surprised even his friends. His
early training in the atmosphere of Scottish
schools and the Presbyterian church had ingrained in him a knowledge of the Scriptures
and of the Shorter Catechism, as well as the
works of Shakespeare; and frequently he
revealed an intimate and quick familiarity
with those books which earned for him the
very warm regard of those who were associated with him in parliament.
I remember one occasion early in 1935 in
the House of Commons, during a debate in
which Prime Minister Bennett was bent on
ridiculing Mr. Mackenzie King about his book
Industry and Humanity. Mr. Bennett, who
always was pretty ready with a scriptural
quotation when opportunity afforded, quoted
the ninth verse of the tenth chapter of
Revelation, as follows:

was lived in an atmosphere of expectation
and anticipation which gave vitality to life
itself. In these days when so much emphasis
is placed upon security it is well to remember, as exemplified in the lives of people like
Senator Duff, that the glory of their journey
has lain in the faith and courage which
inspired them. As was so truly expressed in
an editorial offering which many of us must
have read last Saturday:
The pervading sense of the unknown tomorrow is
what makes life alive. Take it away and nothing
is left but a clattering tread-miU.

I think those words really typify and sym-

bolize the outlook and spirit of Senator
William Duff and his wife.
On behalf of the Senate, I extend to the
bereaved family our deepest respect and
sympathy.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
there is not much I can add to the very
eloquent and fluent remarks of the acting
leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Lambert). I had the pleasure and honour of
'being a member of this chamber when
Senater Duff entered it, in May of 1936. He
came here with a great reputation from the
House of Commons.
I remember that

* In the event of the provisions of Article X being invoked by Australia by reason of a short crop, it will be
recognized that certain markets, by virtue of their geographical position, are traditionally dependent upon Australia
for the supply of their requirements of wheat grain and wheat -flour. The necessity of meeting these requirements
will be one of the factors to be taken into account by the Council in determining the ability of Australia to deliver
its guaranteed sales under this Agreement in any crop-year.

ARTICLE IV

Recordings of Transactions Against
Guaranteed Quantities
1. The Council shall keep records for each
crop-year of those transactions and parts of
transactions in wheat which are part of the
guaranteed quantities in Annexes A and B
to Article III.
2. A transaction or part of a transaction
in wheat grain between an exporting country
and an importing country shall be entered in
the Council's records against the guaranteed
quantities of those countries for a crop-year:
(a) provided that (i) it is a price not higher
than the maximum nor lower than the minimum specified in or determined under Article
VI for that crop-year, and (ii) the exporting
country and the importing country have not
agreed that it shall not be entered against
their guaranteed quantities; and
(b) to the extent that (i) both the exporting
and the importing country concerned have
unfulfilled guaranteed quantities for that
crop-year, and (ii) the loading period specified in the transaction falls within that cropyear.
3. A transaction or part of a transaction
for the purchase and sale of wheat shall be
eligible for entry in the Council's records
against the guaranteed quantities of the exporting and importing countries concerned on
the conditions specified in this Article, notwithstanding that the transaction has been
entered into before the deposit of its instrument of Acceptance of this Agreement by
either or both of those countries.

4. If a commercial contract or governmental agreement on the sale and purchase of
wheat-flour contains a statement, or if the
exporting country and the importing country concerned inform the Council that they
are agreed, that the price of such wheatflour is consistent with the prices specified
in or determined under Article VI, the wheat
grain equivalent of such wheat-flour shall,
subject to the conditions prescribed in (a) (ii)
and (b) of paragraph 2 of this article, be
entered in the Council's records against the
guaranteed quantities of those countries. If
the commercial contract or governmental
agreement does not contain a statement of the
nature referred to above and the exporting
country and the importing country concerned
do not agree that the price of the wheatflour is consistent with the prices specified
in or determined under Article VI, either of
those countries may, unless they have agreed
that the wheat grain equivalent of that wheatflour shall not be entered in the Council's
records against their guaranteed quantities,
request the Council to decide the issue. Should
the Council, on consideration of such a
request, decide that the price of such
wheat-flour is consistent with the prices
specified in or determined under Article VI,
the wheat grain equivalent of the wheat-flour
shall be entered against the guaranteed quantities of the exporting and importing countries
concerned, subject to the conditions prescribed
in (b) of paragraph 2 of this Article. Should
the Council, on consideration of such a
request decide that the price of such wheatflour is inconsistent with the prices specified

SENATE

in or determined under Article VI, the wheat
grain equivalent of the wheat-flour shall not
be so entered.
5. Provided that the conditions prescribed
in paragraphs 2 or 4 of this Article, other than
that in (b) (ii) of paragraph 2, are satisfied,

recorded against guaranteed quantities for a
crop-year if (a) the loading period specified
in the transaction is within a reasonable time
up to one month, to be decided by the Council,
before the beginning or after the end of that
crop-year, and (b) the exporting and importing
country concerned so agree.
6. The Council shall prescribe rules of procedure, in accordance with the following provisions, for the reporting and recording of
transactions which are part of the guaranteed
quantities:
(a) Any transaction or part of a transaction,
between an exporting country and an importing country, qualifying under paragraph 2, 3,
or 4 of this Article to form part of the guaranteed quantities of those countries shall be
reported to the Council within such period and
in such detail and by one or both of those
countries as the Council shall lay down in its
rules of procedure.
(b) Any transaction or part of a transaction
reported in accordance with the provisions of
subparagraph (a) shall be entered in the Council's records against the guaranteed quantities

parts of transactions shall be entered in the
Council's records against the guaranteed
quantities shall be prescribed by the Council
in its rules of procedure.
(d) The Council shall, within a time to be
prescribed in its rules of procedure, notify
each exporting country and each importing
country of the entry of any transaction or
part of a transaction in the Council's records

shall prescribe in its rules of procedure, the
importing country or the exporting country
concerned objects in any respect to the entry
of a transaction or part of a transaction in
the Council's records against its guaranteed
quantity the Council shall review the matter
and, if it decides that the objection is well
founded, shall amend its records accordingly.
(f) If any exporting or importing country
considers it probable that the full amount of
wheat already entered in the Council's records
against its guaranteed quantity for the current
crop-year will not be loaded within that cropyear, that country may request the Council to
make appropriate reductions in the amounts

entered in its records. The Council shall consider the matter and, if it decides that the
±ccucst r jutifid hcall n-pnd its r0Pmlrds
accordingly.
(g) Any wheat purchased by an importing
country from an exporting country and resold
to another importing country may, by agreement of the importing countries concerned,
be entered against the unfulfilled guaranteed
purchases of the importing country to which
the wheat is finally resold, provided that a
corresponding reduction is made in the amount
entered against the guaranteed purchases of
the first importing country.
(h) The Council shall send to all exporting
and importing countries, weekly or at such
other interval as the Council may prescribe
in its rules of procedure, a statement of the
amounts entered in its records against guaranteed quantities.

minimum price in respect of transactions in
wheat into which the exporting and importing
countries are prepared to enter. Should any
exporting or importing country consider that
it is suffering hardship as the result of such
policies, it may draw the attention of the

QUANTITIES
ARTICLE IX

Adjustments in Case of Nonparticipation or
Withdrawal of Countries
1. In the event of any difference occurring

or Annex B (a) not signing or (b) not depositing an instrument of acceptance of or (c)
withdrawing under paragraph 5, 6, or 7 of
Article XXII from or (d) being expelled
under Article XIX from or (e) being found
by the Council under Article XIX to be in
default of the whole or part of its guaranteed
quantity under this Agreement, the Council
shall, without prejudice to the right of any
country to withdraw from this Agreement
under paragraph 6 of Article XXII, adjust the
remaining guaranteed quantities so as to make
the total in the one Annex equal to the total
in the other Annex.
2. The adjusment under this Article shall,
unless the Council decides otherwise by twothirds of the votes cast by the exporting
countries and two-thirds of the votes cast by
the importing countries, be made by reducing

ARTICLE X

Adjustment in Case of Short Crop or
Necessity to Safeguard Balance of
Payments or Monetary Reserves
1. Any exporting or importing country
which fears that it may be prevented, by a
short crop in the case of an exporting country or the necessity to safeguard its balance
of payments or monetary reserves in the case
of an importing country, from carrying out
its obligations under this Agreement in
respect of a particular crop-year shall report

made to the Council pursuant to this paragraph shall be heard without delay.
2. If the matter relates to a short crop,
the Council shall, in dealing with the request
for relief, review the reporting country's
supply situation.
3. If the matter relates to balance of payments or monetary reserves, the Council shall
seek and take into account, together with all
facts which it considers relevant, the opinion
of the International Monetary Fund, as far
as the matter concerns a country which is a
member of the Fund, on the existence and
extent of the necessity referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.
4. The Council shall, in dealing with a
request for relief under this Article, adhere
to the principle that the country concerned

is an exporting country, make sales to meet
its obligations under this Agreement and, if
it is an importing country, make purchases
to meet its obligations under this Agreement.
5. The Council shall decide whether the
reporting country's representations are well
founded. If it finds they are well founded,
it shall decide to what extent and on what
conditions the reporting country shall be
relieved of its guaranteed quantity for the
crop-year concerned.
The Council shall
inform the reporting country of its decision.
6. If the Counsel decides that the reporting
country shall be relieved of the whole or part
of its guaranteed quantity for the crop-year
concerned, the following procedure shall
apply:

importing countries, or, if the reporting
country is an exporting country, invite the
other exporting countries, to increase their
guaranteed quantities for the crop-year concerned up to the amount of the guaranteed
quantity of which the reporting country is
relieved. Any increase in guaranteed quantities under this sub-paragraph shall require
the approval of the Council.
(b) If the amount of which the reporting
country is relieved cannot be fully offset
in the manner provided in (a) of this paragraph, the Council shall invite the exporting
countries, if the reporting country is an
importing country, or the importing countries,
if the reporting country is an exporting country, to accept a reduction of their guaranteed
quantities for the crop-year concerned up to
the amount of the guaranteed quantity of

CANADIAN BROADCASTING

INQUIRY

On the inquiry by Hon. Mr. Reid respecting
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation:
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Honourable senators, I
understand that the information requested by
the honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) will be delivered to the
chamber later this afternoon. There has been
some delay, the reason for which is not quite
evident to me, in the production of this
information; but after repeated efforts we
have the assurance that the reply will be
furnished today, so that I hope to be able to
place it in the hands of the honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid)
in the order of proceedings tomorrow.
INTERNATIONAL WHEAT AGREEMENT
RESOLUTION OF APPROVAL

Hon. Norman P. Lambert moved:
That it is expedient that the houses of parliament do approve the International Wheat Agreement opened for signature at Washington on April
13, 1953, and that this house do approve the same.

He said: Honourable senators, this resolution is a sequel of the bill to amend the Wheat
Board Act which passed through this house
the other day. As a matter of fact the Wheat
Board Act is the legislative authority on
which this agreement is based. If our practice in this respect were similar to that of the
British parliament, the agreement would be
carried out by the action of the crown alone;
but recent practice over a brief period in this
country has been to refer to us as well as to
the other house all international agreements.
It is really a concession to democratie procedure. As I have indicated, it is doubtful
whether a similar resolution would be submitted to the British parliament for debate

to discuss any agreement may do so by resolution. Our practice is to obtain parliamentary ratification, and I mention this
circumstance because the bill on which this
motion is based was passed here the other
day.
The agreement itself was printed as an
appendix to the Official Report of Debates of
the Senate and as an appendix to the Minutes
of the Proceedings of the Senate on April 27.
It is composed of five parts containing some
twenty-three articles. I do not propose to
examine these articles at length, for a good
deal of the matter in them is of a technical
nature. I would suggest that the subjectmatter of this resolution might easily be
referred to the appropriate standing committee for further study, where detailed
explanations may be given to honourable
senators on any of its aspects.
Article I of Part 1 of the agreement which
deals with its objectives, reads:
The objectives of this agreement are to assure
supplies of wheat to importing countries and
markets for wheat to exporting countries at equitable and stable prices.

That paragraph strikes me as being a
pretty fair equivalent of a phrase that was
used freely in this country some twenty
years ago, and which was quoted quite freely
in the debates of parliament at that time.
The phrase "for use and not for profit" was
associated with socialistic propaganda in
this country. However, I think the expression summarizes, in one sense, the cited
objectives of this agreement-to assure sup-

plies of wheat to importing countries and
markets for wheat to exporting countries at
equitable and stable prices. It is an expression which should give us some thought. I
say this without advocating or criticizing the
objectives of the agreement. At the same
time, I think it suggests at once that the
contents of this bill, and the resolution upon
which it is based, present parliament with a
problem that has as much to do with political philosophy as it has with economics and
finances.
Part 2, dealing with rights and obligations,
is rather lengthy and contains two annexes.
Annex A lists the countries which are guaranteeing certain purchases under the agreement, and annex B lists the countries which
are guaranteeing sales under the agreement.
The administrative machinery to be used by
the Council in recording the transactions, and
so on, of the agreement are set forth.
Article V of Part 2, which deals with the
enforcement of rights, is rather lengthy and
provides for action in case of disagreement.

APRIL 28, 1953
Article VI, relating to prices, is important
because it mentions the minimum price of
$1.55 and the maximum price of $2.05. Those
prices, I am sure, will be the subject of
some discussion here and probably of some
difference of opinion. At any rate, that is
the practical part of this bill.
In Part 3 are provisions for dealing with
the adjustment of guaranteed quantities in
relation to the amounts that are allocated
to the different countries cited in annex A
and annex B, about which I have spoken.
Part 4 gives the set-up of the organization relating to the administration, namely,
the provision for a council composed of representatives of each exporting country and each
importing country, and also the provision for
a working executive committee. The provisions for disputes and complaints, and
co-operation with other inter-governmental
organizations, are all covered in the last
clauses of Part 4.
The final provisions are in Part 5, where
the conditions regarding the signature,
acceptance, and entry into force of these
resolutions are set forth. The first clause
says:
This agreement shall be open for signature in
Washington until and including April 27, 1953, by
the governments of the countries listed in annex A
and annex B to article II.

That was yesterday, I am informed authoritatively that forty-one of the forty-two countries that are cited in annex A have already
signed these agreements, subject to the ratification of their different countries in accordace with their respective constitutional
procedure. It is also set forth that any signatory government which has not accepted this
agreement by July 15, 1953, may be granted
by the council an extension of time after that
date for depositing its instrument of acceptance. But a limit is set to the extension that
may be granted, namely, August 1, 1953. So
that in the administration of this agreement,
a good deal of latitude is given to the council
for meeting unforseen contingencies.
Regarding the merits or demerits of this
agreement, I think that a large number of
those who have discussed the agreement have
fastened upon the fact that the United Kingdom has not become a signatory. Britain has
decided for the present at least to stand out.
There is a suggestion, really a decision, on
the part of the British government to decontrol their markets altogether, but that will
not be done before September 15 of this year.
In the meantime the imports of Great Britain
are under the Cereal Division of the Department of Food Administration, and they have
not yet been decontrolled.
68112-34

It is only fair to state that the position of
Great Britain in relation to these agreements
is not so much one of objection to the form
of the agreements and to the co-operative
character of the organization that is being
set up to serve them, as it is a position resulting from the problem of exchange, of acquiring a sufficient supply of dollars with which
to see their way clearly ahead in the operations of the coming year.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: Might I ask the honourable senator a question? An article appeared
in a paper recently saying that if England did
not sign, Australia would not sign. Is it your
understanding that Australia has signed?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: My understanding is
that Australia has signed. I may say that
on page 7 of the agreement as printed in the
Minutes of the Proceedings, of which I have
a copy in my hand, there is the following
note:
In the event of the provisions of article X being
invoked by Australia by reason of a short crop,
it will be recognized that certain markets, by
virtue of their geographical position, are traditionally dependent upon Australia for the supply
of their requirements of wheat grain and wheat
flour. The necessity of meeting these requirements will be one of the factors to be taken into
account by the council in determining the ability
of Australia to deliver its guaranteed sales under
this agreement in any crop-year.

So that apart altogether from the monetary
situation in relation to pounds sterling, this
other natural contingency affects the position
of Australia. But my understanding is that
all of the countries have signed this agreement with the exception of Great Britain.
As to the ratification of the agreement,
there is still time for any country that has
signed the agreement to refuse to go through
with it.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: May I ask the honourable senator this. He referred to the crop
year after the lst of July. Is it up to the
lst of August?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: This is to operate in the
new crop-year, 1953-54.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: And it also operates in
relation to carry-overs?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Oh, yes, it operates over
all wheat on hand. Naturally, every country
that is entering into this agreement is going
to do so on the basis of merchandising all
the wheat it has-new crop and carry-overs,
and anything that may develop inside the
next three years. The period of the agreement, of course, is for three years, as from
July 31, 1953.
The question of prices, as I said, will no
doubt be debated here. I am trying to
present these provisions just as objectively

SENATE
as I can, without expressing too much of my
own personal view in regard to them. So far as
the maximum price of $2.05 and the miuliium
price of $1.55 are concerned, I am not a
prophet, nor the son of a prophet. Furthermore, I do not think it is possible to argue
conclusively with anyone who asserts that
he is a prophet in this matter. But in relation
to the United Kingdom Wheat Agreement
that we made in 1946, and which went into
effect during 1947, I would point out that the
prices quoted then were subject to some
criticism-and in this house, too-on the
ground that they were too low.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: And that the prospect
was that the farmer, the producer, would
not receive enough. Well, if I were going
to engage in soothsaying, I certainly would
not care to criticize these prices on the same
ground.

Hon. Mr. Lambert: I do not think it
amounts to a combine. The elements of compêtitionthatwere expressed i- ith- meeptings
that took place in Washington would certainly
remove any suggestion that it could be
regarded as a combine.
I am informed on fairly good authority that
one of the major supplier countries felt very
strongly that the price of wheat should have
been $2.50 a bushel. Britain, of course,
thought that it should have been $2, or five
cents a bushel less than the agreed price. It
has been quite evident over the past twelve
months that Britain has been opposed to
an international wheat agreement, largely
because of the problem and difficulty of
exchange.
Hon. W. M. Aselline: Honourable senators,
first may I say that this agreement is not at
all in the nature of a combine, because of the
fact that it is an agreement reached between

speeches, and brought the attention of the

APRIL 28, 1953
house to the fact that under those agreements
the farmers whom I represent had lost a
considerable sum of money.
In the first case, the farmers were depending on the "have regard to" clause contained
in the British wheat agreement, and they
were greatly disappointed when at the end of
the five-year period that clause was not
honoured. I was opposed to the British Wheat
Agreement because I believed that, in view
of a probable increase in the selling value of
wheat, the price was not high enough. For
the same reason I objected to the first International Wheat Agreement which came into
being after the five-year pool, and I think I
was justified by events. During the whole
period from 1945 to the present time wheat
bas been worth considerably more than we
have been paid for it.
The agreement now before us is not at all
satisfactory to me. I notice that prices are
In
to be paid in United States dollars.
Canada the American dollar is at a discount,
and for that reason we shall receive less than
the maximum of $2.05 per bushel. Moreover,
this price is less six cents carrying charge
which the growers obtained under the agreement now about to expire; so the nominal
figure is reduced to $1.99. Nor is that sum
net to the farmer; from it must be subtracted, so far as Saskatchewan is concerned,
another 18 cents for handling charges and
freight.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: That is, to Fort William.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: To Fort William, Port
Arthur and Vancouver, B.C.
Consider next the minimum price of $1.55.
The loss of the six cents carrying charge
and the deduction of handling charges and
freight leave the farmer with a price much
less than would appear on the surface.
It must also be remembered that these prices
are for No. 1 wheat, but only about 25 per
cent of our production reaches that grade.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: My honourable friend
must admit that more than 25 per cent
graded No. 1 last year.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: If I were speaking of
the Rosetown area I would concede that. But
some of our local grain grades No. 2, and I
have known times when considerable amounts
graded No. 2 to as low as No. 5. In those
years, of course, the returns were considerably
less, because the lower the grade the less the
grower receives for it.
In my opinion, honourable senators, the
price we are to obtain under this agreement
is not sufficient. Many farmers believe, and
so do I, that if the Wheat Board were
entrusted with the sale we would get higher
returns. In that connection I refer to a letter
68112-34J

dated April 22, 1953, issued by the Searle
Grain Company Limited, which gives the

Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Is the Searle Grain
Company, the publisher of that bulletin, a
supporter of a wheat board?
Hon. Mr. Macinnon: No.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I do not think they are
in favour of the Wheat Board at all. In that
respect I do not agree with them. But I am
citing these prices because I believe they are
authentic.
My reason for supposing that the price of
wheat will not decline is that a big crop in
1953 cannot be expected. From 1950 to 1952,
inclusive, our crops were heavy; and during
the time I have been farming, that is since
1918, I have never known of four good crops
in succession. This year the ground throughout the West is very dry. There is practically
no water in the low spots; hardly any rain
has fallen since August of last year, and no
one to whom I have spoken anticipates that
this year's crop will be even an average one.
On another ground I do not think that the
prices are adequate. According to the index
of the Dominion Bureau of Statistics the
cost of machinery and other things the farmer
has to buy, related to an index figure of
100 in 1935-39, is now 216.6. On that basis
the farmer is paying twice as much for his
requirements as he did in the later thirties.
At the same time, comparatively speaking,
the $2.05 which is to be his maximum return
under this agreement is worth only 94J
cents-to be exact, 94.6 cents; and the low
figure of $1.55 for No. 1 wheat is the equivalent of only 714 cents.
Honourable senators will gather that I am
not enamoured of the agreement, and while
I have no doubt that it will be ratified by
the Canadian parliament I do not see how it
can possibly succeed. In the first place,
Britain is not a signatory to the agreement,
and I am afraid that if we sell wheat at $2.05
to the signatory countries we shall run into
trade difficulties with Britain. That country
bas always been our best wheat market, and
I am fearful that this agreement may tend to
sever our mutual trade relations, particularly
with respect to wheat.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask my honourable friend if he would rather sell his wheat
to Great Britain at $2.00 a bushel Gr receive
a higher price at the cost of carrying on only
a minimum of trade with that country?
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: I said earlier that one of
my reasons for not favouring the agreement
is that the price is too low. Like many others,
I feel that the Wheat Board should be
given a free hand to sell at the highest
possible price. I think that answers the
honourable gentleman's question. If we did
not enter the agreement and the Wheat Board
were given a free hand, I would not complain
if it decided to sell wheat to Britain for less
than $2.05 a bushel.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Even though you think
the price of wheat should be higher?
Hon. Mr. Euler: What do you think the
price should be, $2.35 a bushel?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I entirely agree with
the farmers of Alberta in this respect. Considering what is involved in growing an
adequate crop of wheat, the price should be
at least $2.35 a bushel.
Honourable senators, I would not ask that
a vote be taken on the resolution, but as a
wheat producer of some experience I wanted
to place on record my reasons for not favouring this agreement.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I think $2.35 is a fair
price, and I would leave it at that.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, as
one who has consistently opposed the principle of international agreements-not only
the International Wheat Agreement, but the
British Wheat Agreement-I am delighted to
know that my honourable friend from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) is commencing to
see the light and to realize the folly of these
agreements.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Crerar: These agreements, of
course, are no more unsound in principle
today than they were seven years ago. The
honourable acting leader (Hon. Mr. Lambert) made a very true observation today
when he said that twenty years ago a new
sort of philosophy of national well-being
developed in Canada-the philosophy of production for use and not for profit. That philosophy was first launched in this country in
any important way about twenty years ago,
and was the basic theory and principle of
socialism, and those who advocated it believed
in the socialistic state. I never had any doubt
that this philosophy was a delusion, but it
was there. In the last seven years, in normal
times, we have had an experiment in grain

accepts the terms of the agreement without
reservation holus-bolus.. France is also an
exporting country that has signed the agreement, but her exports of grain are negligible.
Of the importing countries, by far the largest
importer in the world is Great Britain, and
she has refused to sign the agreement. Her
refusal was not from pique at all. As I have
said in the house before, no people are
shrewder than the British when it comes to
buying foodstuffs: In 1946 they saw what
was obvious to any well-informed person,
that for several years the supplies of foodstuffs would not be sufficient wholly to meet
the demands. There was what is popularly
called a "seller's market", when the demand
for foodstuffs exceeded the supply. It took
several years to re-establish the agricultural
economy of the world after the war.
We entered into, first, the British Wheat
Agreement, then the International Wheat
Agreement. The honourable senator from
Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) did not exaggerate when be spoke of the losses that our
western producers suffered under these agreements. The farmers of Quebec and Ontario
were too shrewd to get involved in agreements of this kind. While the western wheat
grower was selling wheat under these agreements at a sacrifice in world markets, his
counterparts in Ontario and Quebec were
receiving higher, and at times much higher
prices, for a grade of wheat that was not so
good because of climatic and soil conditions.
How anyone can stand up and raise a cheer
for that sort of thing, honourable senators,
is beyond my comprebension. Perhaps my
comprehension is too little.
We are now entering a new phase in this
marketing business. After these prolonged
discussions we have a three-year agreement
with a maximum price of $2.05 and a minimum price of $1.55 per bushel. One important change is made. Under the existing
international agreement, which expires at the
end of July this year, the importing countries
paid the carrying charges of roughly 6 cents
per bushel. Under this new agreement the
carrying charge is put against the producer,
as the honourable senator from Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) stated. So this new
maximum price is really $1.99, compared with
the old maximum of $1.80.
The British have stayed out. Why? Well,
I think there is a disposition in Britain at
the present time to get away from all these
controls. Certainly the attitude taken by the
present British government appears to be to
get free of controls, and so far this has not
been very strongly denounced in the country;

and so they say, "We will take our chance in
the future on buying where we can buy most
cheaply." And they have some warrant for
taking that position. At the lst of March
this year, in the four major exporting countries, namely, the Argentine, Australia,
Canada and the United States, the visible
supplies of wheat were just about 600 million
bushels more than they were in the corresponding period last year. Not only that, but
in 1952, as against 1951, every continent in
the world, excepting Africa, increased its
wheat production. If we take bread grains
production altogether-and bread grains
include not only wheat but rye, and a measure
of corn-the total production in 1952 in the
world was 264 million short tons. That was
just about 23 million tons more than it was
the year before. The inevitable is happening.
When prices are high, production is
stimulated. That law is as old as man himself. The law of supply and demand is now
commencing to operate and will continue to
operate, in the absence of any upheavals of
an international character in the near future.
No matter what Canadian farmers may think,
or what their friends in this bouse may think,
nothing will check the operation of that age
old law.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I interrupt the
honourable senator a moment? Would he
say that this greatly increased production
flowing from the crops of last year, 1952-53,
was the result of the law of supply and
demand?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Well, I am afraid my
honourable friend did not quite clearly grasp
what I had in mind. It is true that climatic
conditions affect production of grain. It is
true that because of the drought of the year
before last the Argentine had a small crop;
but last year she had a big crop. Western
Canada may have a comparatively short crop
this year, but Australia promises to have a
big crop. Present reports indicate that the
European countries will have a good yield.
Overall, it is the law of supply and demand
which will determine prices.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I agree with that, but
it will not determine volume.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I was talking about
volume and its effect on value. If, for
instance, an agricultural implement manufacturer produces a thousand binders and
can sell only five hundred, he has either
to carry over the balance or cut the price.
The effect of these conditions, I repeat, is
now beginning to manifest itself. Will it
continue? What will happen if over the

SENATE
next two or three years the volume of prodiotinn

increases?

We faced such serious

conditions once before when, in the late
twentiesHon. Mr. Haig: 1929Hon. Mr. Crerar: -everyone thought that
the price of grains would continue to go up.
One of the factors in the decline was the
tremendous production which was stimulated
by the prices of those years.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Will the honourable
senator permit a question? Does he suggest
that the production we have had in the past
two years, which has resulted in the surplus
we now have, was stimulated by the price?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I understood him to
complain that the price was not high enough.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Well now, my honourable
friend from Toronto has a much more acute
mind than is betrayed by the question he
has asked.
Sone Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: For the sake of argument,
I will admit that if over the past five or six
years, the farmers of Western Canada had
received full value for their wheat it probably would have further stimulated production on the prairies; nevertheless, the prices
that have existed the world over undoubtedly
have stimulated production, as the production
figures of various countries show.
That, I repeat, is the operation of the law
of supply and demand. The figures I have
given are with respect to wheat production:
there are also figures available on the production of other grains. For instance, the
Bureau of Statistics published the fact that
as of February 19 last Western Canada had
in sight 46 million bushels of oats, as against
39 million at the corresponding time last
year; at the same date we had 71 million
bushels of barley, as against 50 million bushels a year ago; and we had 13 million bushels
of rye, which is also a bread grain, against
6 million a year ago.
The inference to be drawn from these
figures is that stocks are accumulating. In
the face of the facts in Canada and elsewhere
I can quite understand why the British do
not want to sign an agreement-and no one
can blame them for not wanting to sign-if
they think they may be able to buy their food
requirements more cheaply by staying out of
the agreement.
I feel I am trespassing on the patience of
the house, but there is another point I should
like to mention. I would draw the attention
of the house to the fact that Congress has

not yet ratified the agreement on behalf of
the United States. And if Congress refuses
what happens to the agreement? But assuming Congress does ratify it, what then is to be
our policy of selling to Great Britain? Traditionally, Britain has always been our best
customer. I for one express the hope that

when dealing under this agreement, after
August 1, no handicap will be placed upon
Great Britain.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: From the inception of the
wheat pools all the wheat produced in Western Canada that was handled by them was
marketed through the Co-Operative Wheat
Producers Limited-and this was a very substantial volume.
Hon. Mr. Davies: May I be permitted to ask
a question? Where is Great Britain to buy
wheat cheaper if some forty governments
have agreed on a set price?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: They may have to buy
some from us. Perhaps what I am about to
say will answer the question.
The purpose of the pools was to get as high
a price as possible. No one could blame them
for that. But, rightly or wrongly, Great
Britain developed the impression that Canada
was trying to hold her up on the price of
xwheat, with the result that Canadian wheat in
the grist of the British miller was steadily
reduced. My recollection is that sorne mills
discontinued using Canadian wheat altogether.
Sales of Canadian wheat were thereby substantially curtailed. After 1935 Canada spent
a good many thousands of dollars trying to
recapture the British market, and finally succeeded in getting it back.
The moral of all this is that in the future
we should take no chances of risking the loss
of the British wheat market. I have read
some comments in the odd farm journal of
Western Canada te the effect that the producers are rather annoyed with Great Britain
for her refusal to sign. There should be no
thought of reprisals against her. No such
policy could be more ill advised. Patience is
required to work this problem out. Whether
or not this agreement lives out its full term,
I hope that when it is concluded we shall
have seen the last of such marketing devices.
I also hope that this great socialistic adventure
in which we have indulged ourselves for the
past seven years will then become nothing but
an unhappy memory.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: I should like to ask the
honourable senator a question. Does he think
that the maximum price for wheat fixed by

the agreement is too high, and if so by how
much?

APRIL 28, 1953
Hon. Mr. Crerar: It is impossible to answer
that question. Potatoes, and perhaps eggs,
are important farm products in my honourable
friend's province. Is the price of eggs too
high, and if so, how much too high? And
does the price depend on the supply of them
and the demand there is for them? One
cannot presume to say that a price is too
high until it is established in the market
place; then the seller knows he is getting
the value, reflected in the market price. It
is a mistake to suppose that the farmers
will necessarily get $2.05 for their wheat
over the next three years. That is the
maximum under this agreement. If supplies
continue to pile up, prices will decline, and
if they fall below $1.55 a bushel, I expect to
see some of these countries abandon their
agreements.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Does my honourable friend
not think that the fact that the United States,
the biggest of the exporting countries, wanted
a price of at least $2.05, was the determining
factor in the fixing of the price at that figure?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: They wanted more than
that.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: My information is limited
to sources available to everyone else. But
there is an impression, which I think is
correct, that Canada would have been willing
to take $2 per bushel but the United States
delegates refused to come down, giving as
a reason that they could not persuade
Congress to accept less, and that they
might have difficulty in getting Congressional
approval of a $2.05 maximum.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The agreement before
us applies, of course, to next summer. Is it
not true that at the present time we are and
for some time past have been selling wheat
for export at $2, $2.05 and upwards?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That is, outside the wheat
agreement?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: No, through the Wheat
Board. They have been selling a great deal
of wbeat at these maximum prices; at least
that is my information. While my honourable
friend is answering that question, would he
elucidate a little what he meant by his
reference to the placing of handicaps in connection with our dealings with Great Britain?
I think he should make his meaning clear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I will put it this way:
under the wheat agreement which will terminate on July 31 this year the maximum
price has obtained throughout the whole
period. That maximum was $1.80 in United
States funds. When our dollar in comparison
with the American dollar was at a considerable discount our farmers received, if my

memory is correct, up to $1.98 in Canadian
funds. When our dollar went to a premium
over the United States dollar the price our
farmers received declined below $1.80 through
the operation of the exchange rate. That
occurred under the terms of the existing
agreement. But outside of that, the Wheat
Board sold as Class 2 wheat probably onethird of the wheat produced in the Prairie
provinces. Class 2 wheat is simply a term
used to mark the distinction between wheat
sold under the agreement and wheat sold
outside the agreement. I have not looked up
the Class 2 prices over the last few days,
but I believe they were cited by the honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert),
and they are still some twelve or fourteen
or fifteen cents above the wheat agreement
figure. That is, we are still selling to countries outside the wheat agreement at higher
prices than are being paid by countries signatory to the agreement.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Or if those countries needed
more wheat than their quota, they would pay
a higher price.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes. If Britain required
more wheat than the maximum to be provided
under the agreement she had to pay a higher
price for it. I hope that answers the
question.
Hon. B. B. Horner: Honourable senators, I
shall speak briefly, at the risk of repeating
something which has been said, and in the
hope of being able to interject some new
thoughts in connection with this motion. I
regret that the honourable acting leader of the
government (Hon. Mr. Lambert) made the
remark he did about production for use and
not for profit. What we in Canada are asking
for is the chance to produce wheat at a profit.
I fail to see anything socialistic in that. The
discussion has given the honourable senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) an opportunity to depict himself as the outstanding
exponent of individual enterprise and liberty
and all that sort of thing. This attitude of
his sometimes amuses me. I would like to
remind him that the people who claim they
landed the government he supports in the
position it is in today insist that there is
but one more hurdle to jump before their
aims are achieved: that is the enactment of
national health insurance, to which, they
claim, the government has pledged itself.
Already, through the pressure of my honourable friend's supporters, a nation-wide system
of pensions is on the statute books. But why
the honourable senator should imagine that
a further advande along socialistic lines would
be advocated by the group on this side, I cannot understand.

SENATE
I was amazed when the honourable senator
from Northumberland (Hon. Mr. Burchill)
ikened this agreeumet u uuine,
although
if what he had in mind was that Canada's
asking price for surplus wheat was arrived
at in conjunction with the United States, and
in a sense, in opposition to Britain, our main
purchaser, I suppose be is right. But I do
not agree that the wheat producer is making
any undue profit.
I can tell the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) what has caused
the rise in the production of wheat in Western
Canada. It is-and no person acquainted with
the facts can deny it-the invention and
introduction of the weed spray, the system
of spraying crops to kill the weeds.
No
development in the past several years bas
donc more to enlarge wheat production on the
prairies.
In the days before wheat was
sprayed the farmer had to kill the weeds,
otherwise be had to summer-fallow every
other year. If he attempted to grow wheat
without killing the weeds it would prove an
unprofitable business. The use of the weed
spray has done more than anything else to
increase the production of wheat in the last
few years, and nowadays a farmer is sometimes able to grow a good crop even in the
third year.
Honourable senators, it is true that I was
opposed to the original wheat agreement,
because I considered the price was too low.
At that time a great deal was said about
the "have regard to" clause, but the only
thing our farmers received from Britain for
fulfilling their obligation was: "Thank you.
We have carried on a satisfactory business
with you, but don't forget that we have purchased bacon and a lot of other goods from
you."
Hon. Mr. Euler: Did the farmers not get $65
million from the government?
Hon. Mr. Horner: That was a mere pittance.
I am a little alarmed at this time. Britain's
long years of experience in purchasing food
for ber large population-I think she has
become the world's greatest importer of foodstuffs-enabled her to save millions of dollars
under the British Wheat Agreement of 194647 and the original International Wheat
Agreement. She negotiated wonderful bargains for herself and I am just afraid thatHon. Mr. Aselline: She might be right again.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Yes. Britain was right
before and she might be right again. The
people of Western Canada realize they suffered a loss under those agreements, and they
feel that all Canadians should have shared in
those losses. But, because Britain is an important market for our agricultural products, the
farmers of Western Canada are not opposed to

the agreement now under discussion. Personally, I would have accepted Britain's offer
unc

Ty linnnane.thnd

th.-

Canadian government will still make every
effort to induce Britain to sign the agreement,
but I rather imagine that our government is
being discouraged from doing this by our
neighbours to the south. I may be wrong,
but I heard something to the effect that the
United States had made some sort of a threat
to Great Britain to prevent her from attempting to negotiate a Commonwealth agreement.
Therefore, it may not be possible to lower
the minimum price under this agreement
below the minimum price being asked for
by the United States. In any event, it may
be rather premature at this time to be concerned about this, because Congress has not
even ratified the agreement yet.
The honourable senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) said that the wheat producer bas been a mere cog in a state machine
during the past seven years. I should like
to know how be has always regarded the
farmer.
I have been growing wheat in
Western Canada since 1907, and I know that
long before the Wheat Board was established
I had no control or say as to the grading or
pricing of my wheat. It bas never seemed
to me that the farmer has been anything but
a cog in a machine.
The honourable gentleman from Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) lives in a wheat-producing community. In my district, which is some
150 miles distant from his, some farmers
raise horses, others raise cattle, and still
others cultivate small garden farms. But out
West we all know what it costs to grow wheat
and we have a pretty good idea what it
should sell for. In the East, however, most
people are unfamiliar with wheat prices, and
when they hear a certain figure quoted they
say, "That sounds like a lot of money".
I believe the honourable senator from Rosetown was away out when he said that 25 per
cent of the wheat in Western Canada graded
No. 1. I doubt if there ever was a year when
it did. Whenever there is plenty of wheat
to market, the grade is invariably lowered.
A grain elevator official admitted to me that
wheat graded No. 3 is really No. 2 wheat.
I can understand this, for it gives the Wheat
Board a great advantage in selling wheat
and it results in our wheat being highly
regarded and favoured in competition with
wheat from other countries. We are selling
wonderful wheat graded No. 3 and really
good milling wheat graded No. 4.
When
freight costs and other expenses are added
up, the Western farmer will only be getting a
little more than a dollar a bushel for his

APRIL 28, 1953
wheat, so there should be no fear of overproduction because of the price that is being
offered under this agreement.
Honourable senators, this agreement may
not be all that we would like it to be, but
generally speaking I think it will be a good
thing. It will assure our farmers a set price
for a certain portion of their wheat over the
next three years. Freight rates have increased
steadily, and right now there is a demand
for still a further increase. The cost of shipping wheat on the Great Lakes is about
four times what it was when I first started
growing wheat.
All things, considered, the
wheat producers are in a rather difficult
position. Let me repeat that I hope nothing
will be left undone by our government to get
Britain to sign this agreement, for I feel it
would be in the best interest of Canada's
wheat and other trade with that country.
We are all desirous of having peace with
Russia. Britain needs dollars badly, and as
she needs to buy food where she can get it
cheapest, what is to stop her from making a
wheat agreement with Russia, one of the
world's largest producers of wheat? Just a
year ago last fall I was shown some Russian
oats at a mill in Ireland. They were a good
quality of oats, and if Great Britain was
buying oats from Russia then there is every
possibility of her buying wheat from Russia
now.
Many farmers in western Canada might, at
first glance, be disappointed with the price
but I think they would feel quite satisfied
with the agreement, even at $2. For my
part, I would say go ahead.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, I had
in mind this afternoon directing two questions to the leader of the government. Perhaps the second question can be answered
by honourable senators experienced in the
growing and selling of wheat. I have listened
for some twenty years to discussions about
wheat. No subject has been more thoroughly
discussed. I remember that at one session,
particularly, wheat was the topic of discussion for three weeks in the other house. We
called it the "Wheat, Wheat, Wheat Session."
The question I wish to ask particularly is
this: What is the cost of producing a bushel
of wheat? In the province of British Columbia we can tell you exactly what it cost
to produce a dozen eggs, a ton of potatoes,
or a gallon of milk. In my province, the
farmer knows the cost of what he sells and
also the price at which he must sell to
derive a margin of profit to live on. So I
would like to know if it has ever been
worked out just what it costs a farmer on
the prairie to produce a bushel of wheat.

If that were known, we would be in a position to judge whether $2.05 is a fair price or
not, apart entirely from the existing price in
the markets of the world. As a buyer of
wheat, I am particularly interested to know
what it costs the farmer to produce a bushel
of wheat.
Hon. Mr. Horner: You do not grow wheat
in a building; it is grown outside. You can
determine the cost of production of eggs,
because they are produced in buildings and
are not subject to the varying conditions
under which wheat is grown and produced
over a period of years.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I have never heard of potatoes, for instance, being grown in a building, or milk either. Every year I see hundreds
of farmers coming from the prairies, and
they are living the "life of Riley". I am not
speaking of the men who keep livestock, but
simply of those who grow wheat. Goodness
knows we are paying plenty for the wheat
we buy in British Columbia. Burnt wheat
is being sold through the Wheat Board to the
poultry breeders in my province for $55 a
ton. I would like to know what the farmers
are now getting from the Wheat Board for
that wheat which in times past used to be
discarded.
Another question I would like to ask is
this: Can Great Britain buy wheat from
other countries outside of this agreement?
That is important. If she cannot, of course,
she will have to come to Canada.
Hon. Mr. Haig: She can buy wheat where
she likes.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Are other countries, such
as Argentina, able to supply it?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Both the Argentine and
Russia can.
Hon. Mr. Reid: If they do, that will be a
serious matter for us.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I think none of the signatories to this agreement would be permitted
to sell wheat to Great Britain at less than
the set price; but she is quite free to buy
wheat from Russia, the Argentine, or any
other country that is not included in this list.
In years past, even when the British Wheat
Agreement existed, Britain was buying outside. As a matter of fact, she paid more than
the Canadian price.
Hon. Mr. Reid: What is your answer to my
first question-the cost of growing a bushel
of wheat?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I know that for the last
forty years, at any rate, attempts have been
made to assess the cost of producing a bushel
of wheat. An average figure has never been

SENATE
accepted because of the widely variable conditions in the growing and producing of wheat.
The yield of wheat in one district wouîa vary
so much from that in another that it was
impossible to reach a fair conclusion as to
the average cost of producing a bushel. And
I do not think anyone can state what it is
today.
Hon. Mr. Horner: If you were to start with
Manitoba, go across the three prairie provinces and ask every farmer on each side of the
road along the way, they might all give you
an honest answer, but no two answers would
be alike.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Would it be fair to assume
that a farmer having a fair sized acreage of
land and a good crop would obtain a good
profit from $2.05 per bushel?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I would like the honourable senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr.
Horner) to answer that question. But I suppose we can take it that wheat would not be
grown if it did not yield a profit.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: Honourable senators, I
would like to give a little information on a
question which was raised by the honourable
senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine).
There were 249,000 cars inspected of the
1951-52 crop; 32 per cent were contract grade.
Contract grade includes No. 1 Hard, No. 1
Northern, No. 2 Northern and No. 3 Northern.
I have not got them separated, but the inspections passed Winnipeg were 26 per cent, contract; Calgary, 46 per cent, contract; Moose
Jaw, 39 per cent, contract; Saskatoon, 34 per
cent, contract; and Medicine Hat, 58 per cent,
contract-it was mostly milling wheat that
was diverted there. But of the total, 249,000
cars, 32 per cent were contract.
Hon. Mr. Horner: And contract includes
Nos. 2 and 3 Northern?
Hon. Mr. Paterson: No. 1 Hard, and Nos.
1, 2 and 3 Northern.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Did I understand the
acting leader (Hon. Mr. Lambert) to say that
if Canada delivers the grain under the
contract she cannot sell the surplus as she
likes?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: We are bound by the
terms of this agreement.
Hon. Mr. Haig: We are bound to deliver
250 million bushels under the agreement.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: If 250 million bushels
were sold in accordance with this agreement,
I should think any surplus could be disposed
of anywhere.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am not going to enter into
the discussion at length, because my honourable associate from Rosetown (Hon. Mr.

Aseltine) and the honourable member from
Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr.»Horner) have clearly
T 9m
stated the positirn of sur part,.
delighted with the remarks of the honourable
member from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar),
and I agree with everything he has said. He
was absolutely right, and there is no answer
to his argument at all. But what troubles
me particularly is this: the British government apparently thinks the price of grain is
going to be less than $2.05 per bushel. It
may be right or wrong. Now, perhaps I shall
be all alone in what I am about to say. My
personal opinion is that we ought to sell to
Great Britain all the wheat she needs after
we have delivered the 250 million bushels
which we have contracted to deliver. My
reason for thinking so is that we now have
more than 600 million bushels of wheat in
sight in Canada. I would ask the honourable
from Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr.
senator
Paterson) if my figure is right.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: Absolutely.
Hon. Mr. Haig: With that much wheat in

sight, we should sell to Great Britain, if she
is willing to buy, at less than $2.05 a bushel.
The senator for Edmonton (Hon. Mr.
MacKinnon) may say, "It is not your wheat
you are selling, it is my wheat; and why
should you tell me the price to sell at?"' I
am reminded that during the operation of
the British Wheat Agreement he sold his
wheat at prices away below the market price;

in fact, the Government of Canada forced
him to sell his wheat for domestic use at 75
cents a bushel.
We in Canada are all beholden to our
primary producers.

No matter how much we

talk about industry and other things, without
minerals, pulpwood, fish, grain and other
farm produce we would have very little to

trade. The operations of, for instance, the
Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Company
at Flin Flon may be called an industry, but
they are simply the taking of the mineral
out of the ground, refining it and selling it.
The mineral is somewhat in the same category
as pulpwood-it is a primary product.

The economy of Canada's primary producers is more dependent on the markets of
Great Britain than of any other nation.
Although in many ways I admire the United
States, I believe that country is on the verge
of a new trade policy. The moment the
importation of Canadian products threatens
to reduce prices of home-grown commodities
over there Congress will bar further importation.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Are we not doing the same
thing?

APRIL 28, 1953
Hon. Mr. Haig: We may have to do it, but
we are not now doing it. Of course, our
imports from the United States far exceed
their imports from us. My friend from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) would like to
sell to the United States the products of
his province, such as fish, lumber and fruit
-and aluminum, when it is available; and we
in the Prairie provinces would like to sell
them our grain, hogs and cattle. But I would
point out that Canadian producers can only
hope to sell in the United States under conditions favourable to that country. On the other
hand, so long as Great Britain remains a
nation she will have to buy her primary
products abroad, and we cannot afford to lose
her markets.
Perhaps what I am about to say should not
be said. I feel that we have something to
fear from Russia. That country has a control
over her primary producers that is not to be
compared with that of any other country. If
Russia thought for a moment that she could
hamper Canada's 14 million people by selling
primary products to Great Britain at prices
that caused her own people to starve, she
would not hesitate to do so. I do not know
whether my friend from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid) thinks he pays too much
for his wheat, but I would point out to him
that the British market for his fruit, fish
and lumber will be cut off if Russia decides to
cut prices and supply that market. Indeed, if
I were the leader of the Russian people and
believed in the Soviet philosophy, I would
look for a market for my primary products
in Britain. Britain would not have to pay
Russia in gold or American dollars, but could
return manufactured goods which the Russian
people need.
I honestly believe that in the negotiation of
this agreement our people should have held
out for a maximum price of $2 per bushel.
A difference of five cents is not enough to
cause us to risk the loss of the British trade.
Undoubtedly our negotiators were influenced
by the representatives from the United States.
One need only read what Time magazine-a
publication which is favourable to the present
United States administration-had to say
about the head of the Department of Agriculture in that country, to realize that he would
be the first man to throw up a tariff against
our primary products in order to avoid any
threat to home-grown products.
As I see it, this agreement f ails to hold the
British market for the Canadian grain producer. I am not sure that I share the opinion
expressed by the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) that the British
in their shrewdness may make a deal that
will cause the market to slip downwards.

We have in this house some very able
lawyers, and I put to them the question:
How are we going to make Austria take her
6 million bushels of wheat if she does not
want to take it, and particularly if she can
buy it cheaper from her next-door neighbour?
True, the Right Honourable Mr. Howe, speaking in the other place, said that no country
has to take wheat at $2.05 a bushel, that the
agreement permits the price to be reduced
to $1.55. But how can you make any country
take its share under the agreement if it has
not got the money to pay for it? Are we
going to march in our armies and force a
country to live up to the agreement?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I assume my honourable friend has studied the terms of the agreement. In the latter articles there is ample
provision for adjustment and the working
out of such problems as he mentions. No
country need violate the terms of the agreement.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But if the price falls
below the minimum figure you cannot make a
country take its share.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Any country is free to
withdraw from the agreement.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is one of the disadvantages of the agreement. My main objection to it is that we in the prairie provinces
are threatened with the loss of the British
market, an outlet that is vital to our economy. I say to the people of Ontario, Quebec,
and British Columbia-the three great manufacturing provinces in Canada-that if they
lose the retail trade of the Prairie provinces
they will find the going pretty tough. Every
year that we have a big crop central Canada
and British Columbia benefit by it; therefore, they should stand by us and help us
to hold the British market.
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators,
the importance of the subject before us is
such that the house will perhaps allow me
two or three minutes to give the point of
view of a layman from Eastern Canada.
I do not think I exaggerate the position
when I say that the wheat marketing problem has been developing over the past thirty
years. In that time I have listened patiently
to many debates on the subject, and despite
my efforts to comprehend the issues I still
find them confusing. I do not suppose that
the arguments which have been offered this
afternoon have dispelled the confusion,
because on both sides of the house men of
great ability, men engaged in this particular
business and with a wide knowledge of it,
have shown much divergence of opinion on
the question before us.

I believe it would be unwise for those not

of this agreement. I therefore support the
motion.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
before putting the question I feel it is my
duty to point out that during the interesting
debate just concluded some of the cardinal
rules of parliamentary debate have been
broken, even by old parliamentarians. First
of all, no honourable senator should interrupt
another unless given permission to do so, and
the interruption must be only for the purpose
of asking a question and not for making a
statement. Secondly, no question may be put
to an honourable senator who has taken his
seat and after another honourable member
has risen to take part in the debate. I think
it is important to remind honourable senators
of these rules, otherwise we may be proceeding as though we were in Committee of the
Whole.
The question, honourable senators, is on
the motion of Hon. Mr. Lambert for the adoption of the resolution. Is it your pleasure to
adopt the motion?
The motion was agreed to, and the resolution was adopted.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Honourable senators,
I move that the subject-matter of the resolution be referred to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce for further study.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am not objecting to tbe
motion of the acting leader, but I do not
think it is necessary to send this to committee.
There is no demand for it.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I do not see any need
for it.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I moved that the
subject-matter of the resolution be referred
to committee because certain suggestions were
made to me, and I would rather lean in that
direction than in the other. I am in the
hands of honourable senators.
The Hon. the Speaker: If no one insists that
the subject-matter be referred to committee
I would ask honourable senators to give the
acting leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Lambert) permission to withdraw his motion.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Then I ask for permission to withdraw the motion.
Some Hon. Senators: Agreed.
The Hon. the Speaker: The motion for
reference of the subject-matter to a committee
is withdrawn.

RADIO BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Salter A. Hayden moved the second
reading of Bill 337, an Act to amend the
Radio Act, 1938.
He said: Honourable members, the principal purpose of this bill is to provide for the
cancellation of the radio licence fee, which
has been an annoying and irritating sort of
levy on those who own and operate radio
receiving sets in Canada. This cancellation
is to be brought about by deleting from the
Radio Act any reference to private radio
receiving stations and sets, and by repealing
the power given the Governor in Council
which has enabled him to regulate and provide for licence fees. Several other amendments have also been introduced in this bill.
I think the most important amendment is
to be found in section 1, which provides that
a private receiving station operated for gain
is defined as a commercial broadcasting
receiving station. That is a commercial subscription type of station or system which
sends out sound and television programs to
various receiving sets on a charge basis. It
is felt that this type of gainful operation
should be subject to licensing requirements.
The effect of the new subparagraph (bb),
which sets out the definition of a commercial
broadcasting receiving station, and the new
paragraph (j), which defines a radio station,
is to give authority by which a licence fee
can be charged for that type of operation.
Section 2 of the bill re-enacts as new paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 3 of
the Radio Act section 23 (1) of the Canadain
Broadcasting Act, 1936, which was repealed
in the second session of parliament in 1951.
The repeal of section 23 has not been proclaimed to be in force pending the transfer
of this section to the Radio Act, where it is
felt it should be; and until such time as it

SALACIOUS AND INDECENT
LITERATURE
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. John C. Davis presented the report
of the Special Committee appointed to inquire
into the sale and distribution of salacious and
indecent literature in Canada, as follows:
The Special Committee appointed to investigate
the sale and distribution of salacious and indecent
literature in Canada, have in obedience to the
order of reference of December 8, 1952. examined
into the circumstances and conditions relating to
the sale and distribution of such literature, and
now beg leave to report as follows:
It is deeply regretted that the late Honourable
J. J. Hayes Doone will not append his name to this
report. The initiation of this effort was bis. He,
along with a Special Committee, was responsible
for an immense amount of work, executed over
two sessions of parliament. He called together
innumerable
representatives
from communities
from one coast to the other, from which was
derived a cross section of opinion on the subject of

SENATE
our investigation. Too high a tribute cannot be
paid in this report to the late Senator Doone, and
tne enors ne mad i, pursuing this :crk.
The termas of reference of this committee are as
follows:
"That a special committee of the Senate be
appointed, authorized, and directed to examine into
all phases, circumstances and conditions relating
to the sale and distribution in Canada of1. Salacious and indecent literature;
2. Publications otherwise objectionable from the
standpoint of crime promotion, including crime
comics, treasonable and perversive tracts and
periodicals;
3. Lewd drawings, pictures, photographs and
articles whether offered as art or otherwise presented for circulation.
That without limiting the scope of its inquiry,
the committee be authorized and directed to
examine into(a) Sources of supply of the above noted items;
(b) Means and extent of distribution thereof;
(c) Relative departmental responsibility for entry
or transmission;
(d) Sufficiency of existing legislation to define
terms in relation thereto;
(e) Relative responsibility for law enforcement
and effective legal measures of dealing with this
problem.
That the committee have the power to send for
persons, papers and records, and to secure such
services and assistance as may be necessary for
the proper prosecution of its inquiries.
That the said committee shall report its findings
to this house."
The problem
Under the above terms of reference, only circumstances and conditions relating to the sale and
distribution in Canada of salacious and indecent
literature have been investigated, with due allowance to its effect on high school and early university students, along with some investigation of the
sources of supply, means of extensive distribution
thereof (relative to parliament's responsibility for
its entry and especially in regard to existing legislation relating thereto), and the relative responsibility for law enforcement and effective legal
measures dealing with the provinces. The following are the findings:
This problem is not isolated to Canada; in fact,
it is world-wide in scope and has been in existence
for a great many years. A similar committee in
the United States bas reported to the House of
The League of Nations had an
Representatives.
organization which inquired into this type of literature in connection with the white slave trade. But
for the past few years, owing to a new and very
popular type of presentation and the extension of
distributing agencies, this type of literature bas
flooded Canada from one ocean to the other. It
comes in many forms: the soft-covered book, selling at a small price; numerous periodicals and
threatened
a
more recently
and
magazines;
immense influx of the digest type of sex literature.
This literature originates, directly or indirectly,
in the United States, with about ten per cent in
Canada. Its method of production is either through
direct importation, in carload or truck-load shipments, or the introduction of plates of such questionable works for reprinting and distribution in
Canada.
The distribution is very efficient, effective and
economical. Numerous publishers, with representatives in Canada, have contacts with about fiftydistributing agencies occupying
four different
geographical franchises. So efficient is this operation, that it is only a matter of a few days after

these books land in Canada on the floors of the
distributing agencies, or from the printers in
rana hefore they appear on the display stands
throughout our country.
A word about the display stands. When our
Canadian literature was limited to the hardcovered books, with the salacious and sexual type
the exception, 200 books stores could be policed
by the available force without difficulty, Now that
modern mass production and distribution bas
come into effect, with at least 9,000 outlets in
Canada, and in spite of a probable instantaneour
shock to Canadian public, it bas been handled
in a rapid and efficient manner and is now firmly
established.
To this problem (which as stated is world wide
in scope and an immediate threat from the United
States) our committee, in the short time of its
existence, has addressed itself as far as it concerns Canada and its effect on the Canadian juvenile mind and conscience. We propose to divide
our report into four parts, under the headings:
Post Office Department;
Department of National Revenue,
Excise Division;
Present Legislation;

Customs

and

An Appeal to All Canadians.
Post Office Department

minor degree.
is divided into categories "1", "2" and "3". If this
literature comes in in bulk under either category
"2' or "3" and if there is reason to suspect that
it is of a salacious or indecent nature, it is referred
to the Customs Division, along with other parcels
of the same category, for examination and treatment. If plates or mats for books come into the
hands of the Post Office Department, these in turn
are referred to the Customs Division for their
decision.
If the material comes under class "1", at letter
rate, and there is reason to suspect it, the recipient
is called to the office and requested to open same
in the presence of officials. He does this voluntarily, but if he should refuse to allow this
examination, the material is taken and put in the
Dead Letter Office, and returned to the sender in
the other country, marked "Undeliverable".
Department of National Revenue, Customs and
Excise Division.
The whole import question finally ends up in
the hands of the Customs and Excise Division for
decision. Imports mainly come through in either
carload lots or by truck, or in less than carload
lots, or in book plates for reprinting, to the extent
at the present time of 2,500 titles per year for the
soft-covered books, with a threat of an enormous
increase presently if nothing is done about the
situation; with a similar entry, or attempted entry,
of quantities of magazines which are monthly
growing more and more vicious and "colourful"
in content and exhibition.
As mentioned above, when there were only a
couple of hundred titles produced a year, it was
a very simple matter to police the whole situation,
including the magazine field, and a few girls, with
a Head in the Customs and Excise Division, were
apparently quite sufficient to keep this matter in
shape or battered down. But, with the immense
influx of a total of about 3,000 titles of books,
magazines and periodicals per year, with an
impending increase of a much larger nunber, the
present facilities and machinery of the Customs
and Excise Division appear to be absolutely inadequate to handle the situation or police this fleld.

APRIL 29, 1953
The Customs and Excise Division operates under
Item No. 1201, Schedule "C", of the Customs
Tariff. This item has been in the Customs Tariff
since 1867, with amendments in 1868 and 1879, and
is still in force, reading as follows: "Books, printed
paper, drawings, paintings, prints, photographs or
representations of any kind of a treasonable or
seditious or of an immoral or indecent character."
Apparently this section of the Customs Tariff
has been sufficient in its operation up to a comparatively recent time; but the immense flood of
literature coming in at all the various ports of
Canada, subject to the supervision of a small group
at Ottawa, has proven that the personnel at the
present time is inadequate.
Your committee recommends that the Excise and
Customs Division of the Department of National
Revenue expand its operations to meet proportionately the present serious threat to the moral
standards of Canada.
Legal Position
Where prosecutions have to be made in Canada
for either literature produced and printed in
Canada, or for the distribution, sale or exhibition
of imported or domestically published volumes, the
charges have to be made under the Criminal Code.
This is done under section 207 which, as revised in
1949, reads as follows:
"207. (1) Every one is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to two years' imprisonment who
(a) makes, prints, publishes, distributes, circulates, or bas in possession for any such purpose
any obscene written matter, picture, model or other
thing whatsoever; or
(b) makes, prints, publishes, distributes, sells or
has in possession for any such purpose, any crime
comic.
(2) Every one is guilty of an indictable offence
and liable to two years' imprisonment who knowingly, without lawful justification or excuse
(a) sells, exposes to public view or has in possession for any such purpose any obscene written
matter, picture, model or other thing whatsoever;
(b) publicly exhibits any disgusting object or
any indecent show; or
(c) offers to sell, advertises, publishes an advertisement of, or has for sale or disposal any
means, instructions, medicine, drug or article
intended or represented as a means of preventing
conception or causing abortion or miscarriage or
advertises or publishes an advertisement of any
means, instructions, medicine, drug or article for
restoring sexual virility or curing venereal diseases
or diseases of the generative organs.
(3) "Crime Comic" means in this section any
magazine, periodical or book which exclusively or
substantially comprises matter depicting pictorially
the commission of crimes, real or fictitious.
(4) No one shall be convicted of any offence in
this section mentioned if he proves that the public
good was served by the acts alleged to have been
done, and that there was no excess in the acts
alleged beyond what the public good required.
(5) It shall be a question for the judge whether
such acts are such as might be for the public
good, and whether there is evidence of excess
beyond what the public good required; but it shall
be a question for the jury whether there is or
is not such excess.
(6) The motives of the accused shall in all cases
be irrelevant.
(7) It shall be no defence to a charge under
subsection one that the accused was ignorant of the
nature or presence of the matter, picture, model,
crime comic or other thing."

We are informed by the Justice Department that
before this revision was undertaken, they had consulted with the Attorneys General of ail the
provinces of Canada, who in turn consulted their
law enforcement officers in order that the revised
provisions might include everything which would
make the new enactment as enforceable as possible.
The federal jurisdiction is restricted, of course, to
the extent of the enactment of the Criminal Code.
The enforcement is entirely in the hands of provincial jurisdiction and that of the municipalities,
which derive their power from the provincial
authorities. This enactment in 1949 was carefully
drafted, and the Justice Department is of the
opinion that the problem remains that of enforcement. They further add that thus far they have
not received any representations from law enforcement agencies which would lead them to believe
that the present law is not enforceable. Also, none
of those who have stated that it is unenforceable
have shown that they have invoked same and
have failed to secure a conviction because the
law was unenforceable; and further, in some cases
it is difficult to resist the impression that not
wanting to enforce the law, they offer the excuse
that it is not enforceable.
The Department of Justice states that they have
the best reasons for thinking that the law is enforceable, because it was drawn up after the most carefui consultation with the law enforcement officers
of the Attorneys General's departments of the
provinces of Canada, whose responsibility it is to
see that it is enforced.
At the present time there is a case before the
Ontario courts from the City of Ottawa, which bas
been appealed to the Supreme Court of Ontario, and
a decision is presently anticipated, with a further
appeal of the case to the Supreme Court of Canada.
Pending a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada,
the Justice Department proposes not in any way
to alter the present section 207, but if it is necessary
that "207" be revised as soon as the facts of the
situation are presented by a final Court decision,
this effort will be forthwith undertaken.
Further, on the judicial basis, the decision laid
down in the Rex v. Hicklin (1868) 3 Q.B. 360, by
Chief Justice Cockburn of Great Britain has been
assumed, in whole, in the courts of our country,
and his definition is as follows:
"The test of obscenity is this, whether the
tendency of the matter charged as obscenity is
to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are
open to such immoral influences, and into whose
hand a publication of this sort may fall."
The Justice Department nforms us that this
sensible definition is one which now applies in
the Canadian Courts. Everyone recognizes that
there is difficulty in a democratic society in
administering any law which has the effect of
limiting freedom of publication.
Yet, they are
sure that having Chief Justice Cockburn's definition in mind, the present law is not vague or
uncertain, but that it is enforceable if there is a
will to enforce it.
In Canada, any injustice or
curtailment, in any form, of the freedom of the
press, as exercised within the natural moral limits,
is guarded and maintained under this definition.
No cases have been brought to the attention of
the Department of Justice in which prosecutions
have failed through any vagueness in the law. The
law is quite explicit in that if the material complained of is obscene, i.e., to employ the language
of Chief Justice Cockburn in the case above quoted,
if "the tendency of the matter is to deprave and
corrupt those whose minds are open to such
immoral influences and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall", then the person, or
persons, who publishes, distributes or deals with
such matter is guilty of an indictable offence. The

SENATE
Department of Justice further adds that if, after
experience with the enforcement of this law, it is
snown mat t is nut c±forcabl, the cGvenmc
of Canada will be willing to again consult with
the provincial authorities to that end, and revise
existing legislation.
Might we assure the press of Canada that there
is no attempt on the part of the committee under
section 207 to in any way curtail the freedom of
expressicn and opinion presently enjoyed by them.
Appeal to Canadians
In dealing with the present executive action and
legislation, and possible recommendations for its
dilatation, your Committee hopes that the Canadian people will back it up with ail the force of
public opinion, and that those who print, import,
distribute or exhibit for sale salacious and indecent
publications will feel the force of this public
opinion and be made to realize that they are doing
a filthy, immoral and nasty thing to the detriment

committee be permitted to point out that in the
world-wide struggle between the forces of darkness
and evil and those of good, the freedom-loving
democratic countries have need of all the strength
in their moral fibre to combat the evil threat, and
anything that undermines the morals of our
citizens, and particularly of the young, is a direct
un-Canadian act.
Your Committee respectfully suggest, also, that
in view of the fact that the solution of this problem
is in no way complete, this committee be reappointed during the next session of parliament to
keep reviewing the situation with a view to further
and definite action.

In these last two sessions of parliament
your committee has held a considerable number of sittings; and I wish to add an expression of thanks: first, to the Senate Committee
staff, and particularly Mr. John Hinds, for
their continuous and valuable assistance;
second, to the reportorial staff; third, to the
stenographic pool, and in particular, Mrs.
Harrington; fourth, to the Queen's Printer and
his staff, for their co-operation.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this report be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Davis: Tuesday next.

is

to be explained today by my honourable
colleague from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris). It is desired to have Bill F-12 in a
position to go to committee as soon as possible after the passing of the general overall
legislation. A precedent for this procedure
was established a few years ago in connection
with the incorporation of certain pipe line
companies, when a number of private bills
were given first reading pending the passing
of overall legislation known as the Pipe Lines
Act. I understand that the honourable gentleman from Bruce (Hon. Mr. Stambaugh), the
sponsor of this bill, meant to make this
explanation to the house on the motion for
the second reading of the bill. The intention
was that if the general overall legislation was
given first and second reading today, the
sponsor of this private bill would move the
second reading of his bill.
Hon. Mr. Haig: How soon do you expect
copies of the bill to be distributed?
Hon. Mr. Farris: The bill has been printed.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The bill has been printed
and I myself have a copy. I think honourable
senators are aware that a bottleneck has
developed between the Printing Bureau and
both bouses of parliament, and a number of
things have been held up.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask the acting leader
a question? As I understand the situation,
the general overall bill provides for the
incorporation of co-operative companies.
Hon. Mr. Farris: It will apply to such companies after their incorporation.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes. I also understand that
the bill which bas just been introduced by
the honourable gentleman from Bruce (Hon.
Mr. Stambaugh) is private legislation to incorporate a company.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Yes, after the passage of
the overall legislation.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am satisfied that this
private bill which bas just been read a first

reading later today, on the understanding
that honourable senators will be given a
chance to study the overall legislation under
which this private bill will incorporate a

CANADIAN FORCES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. G. P. Burchili moved the second reading of Bill 332, an Act respecting the Canadian Forces.
He said: Honourable senators, at three
previous sessions of parliament bis have
been submitted bearing the tities: an Act to
amend the Canadian Forces Act, 1950; an
Act to amend the Canadian Forces Act, 1951,
and an Act to amend the Canadian Forces
Act, 1952. Honourable senators xviii recali
that those measures contained various provisions respecting national defence, including
amendments to the National Defence Act and
other statutes.
The titie and form of the bill now before
us follow the precedent set by the previous
measures. As I am not fortunate enough
to belong to the distinguished company of
lawyers in this chamber, I am going to ask
the indulgence of the house for following my
notes pretty closely in explaining the bill.
The bill includes amendments to the
National Defence Act, the Defence Services
Pension Act and the Canadian Forces Voting
Regulations which, were enacted as schedule 3
to the Canada Elections Act. All matters
dealt with in the bill relate expressly to
national defence.
One of the amendments to the National
Defence Act makes special provision for the
trial and punishment of Canadian military
personnel serving out of Canada who commit
offences punishable by foreign law. Canadian
service authorities would be able to make
arrangements with the appropriate civil
authorities of foreign countries to permit
Canadian courts martial to try persons alleged
to have committed breaches of foreign law,
in lieu of such persons being tried by foreign
courts. I believe that honourable. senators wil
agree it is very desîrable that we do everything possible to have Canadian servicemen,
accused of committing offences in foreign
countries, tried before Canadian tribunals
xvherever possible. This amendment would go
a long way toward enabling us to realize that
objective.
Another amendment to the National Defence
Act would make it lawful for a Canadian
serviceman sentenced by a foreign court ta
undergo his punishment in a Canadian
military or civil institution. As I have stated,
we desire that Canadian servicemen should

SENATE
be tried by Canadian tribunals wherever they
may he servine. and the amendment I first
mentioned is directed to that end, but there
may be cases where such arrangements cannot be made. It should be possible, however,
in such cases for the offender to serve his
punishment in a Canadian penal institution.
This amendment would help to accomplish
that objective.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Does that require the
consent of the foreign country?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: If I am correct, this
is just enabling legislation. Arrangements
have been made, I believe, by the Canadian
government with ten different countries.
In addition, the amendment would make
possible the transfer of servicemen to military
custody where they have been sentenced by
civil courts in Canada. This is designed
primarily to take care of a case in which a
serviceman is sentenced by a civil court in
a remote area and no appropriate place of
incarceration is available.
The bill contains an amendment to the
National Defence Act that would enable the
Court Martial Appeal Board to exercise the
same discretion that the court martial had
in the first instance of finding an accused
guilty of an alternative offence. The purpose
of this amendment is to avoid the necessity of
the Court Martial Appeal Board having to
order new trials, which are often not practical, where the board considers that the
appellant, although not legally found guilty
by the court martial on a particular charge,
was clearly proven guilty of an associated
offence. This is similar to provisions in effect
for civil appeal courts in Canada. It would
not be possible, however, for the Court Martial Appeal Board or any other authority to
increase the severity of the punishment
imposed in the first instance by the court
martial.
A further amendment to the National
Defence Act would provide for an expeditious
procedure for the disposition of appeals for
which no substantial grounds have been
shown or which have been abandoned.
Approximately one half of the appeals being
received fall in this category but, under the
act as it now stands, the Court Martial Appeal
Board is technically obliged to have a full
hearing. The proposed amendment would
make possible the adoption of rules similar
to those that apply in proceedings before the
civil courts of appeal.
The bill contains two amendments to the
Defence Services Pension Act. One of these
provisions would remove a difficulty that is
being experienced in computing the pensionable service of certain officers and men who

Pension Act would remove an inequity that
now exists in respect of a certain class of
contributor for whom special provision was
made in an amendment passed in 1951. That
amendment did not make provision for pensions to the widows and children of such
contributors and it has now been decided to
extend the entitlements provided for in the
act accordingly.
The bill contains certain amendments to
the Canadian Forces Voting Regulations.
Those regulations, which are schedule 3 to
the Canada Elections Act, were enacted by
chapter 46 of the statutes of 1948 and were
substantially amended by chapter 3 of the
statutes of the second session of 1951. In
recent months further consideration has been
given to the regulations by the Chief Electoral Officer and officials of the Department
of National Defence and it appears that there
are certain faults that require correction at
this time.
(a) The first point is that the regulations
did not provide a sufficiently lengthy
period during which those in the forces
on the date upon which the regulations came into effect, that is June 21,
1952, could complete a statement of
ordinary residence. The period allowed
was only three months, and that period
1952.
21,
September
expired on
Approximately 20,000 persons who
were in the forces on June 21, 1952,
and who are still in the forces, have
not completed a statement of ordinary
residence and cannot now do so in
view of the expiration of the prescribed
period. It was originally proposed that
the period be extended to the date
upon which the present parliament is
dissolved, but an amendment has been
made in the House of Commons. By
that amendment the 20,000 servicemen
mentioned would be able to complete
statements of ordinary residence until
the date of dissolution -or until a date
two months after this bill receives the
Royal Assent, whichever is the earlier.
(b) The second point is that the regulations
contain a technical error in that,
although they permit a member of the
forces to change his place of ordinary
residence by filing the prescribed form
in December of any year, his choice in
effect is restricted to situations as they
existed on June 21, 1952. For example,
if he should desire at any time in
future to select the place where his
wife resides, he would be restricted to

APRIL 29, 1953
the place where she resided on June
21, 1952. This was clearly not what
the framers of the regulations intended,
and the amendment would remove that
difficulty.
(c) The third point is that, although the
regulations do not have the effect of
making completion of a statement of
ordinary residence prior to the service
polling period a condition precedent to
the right to vote, there is no suitable
provision under which a Canadian
Forces elector who has not already
completed a statement -of ordinary residence may select a place of residence
at the polling booth. The proposed
amendment would provide that such
a person may select only the place
where he resided immediately prior to
his enrolment.
(d) The House of Commons made a further
amendment to the bill whereby commanding officers must furnish lists of
service electors to special returning
officers within two weeks after notification of a general election is given in
service orders.

house. However, to a layman it is a little
complicated and I think it merits some
detailed explanation.
As has already been intimated, this bill
must be associated in our thinking with bills
of the type of the private bill introduced by
the honourable member from Bruce (Hon. Mr.
Stambaugh), namely, Bill F-12. I have written out the broad purpose of the bill now
before us and in so far as the two bills are
related this purpose applies to the private
bill as well. The purpose of the two bills,
taken together, is to nationalize, co-ordinate
and extend the iurisdiction o te
rovncial
co-operative credit societies and unions, and
to provide for federal supervision by the
uùperintendent of Insuranr'.
Honourable senators who have studied this
bill may share my surprise upon learning
the extent and duration of the operations of
co-operative credit unions in Canada. In
the other house "credit union" was definedand I adopt the definition-as a group of
individuals tied together by some common
or basic interest, such as a vocational or fraternal interest or for some common purpose.

Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask what interest is

Hon. Mr. Farris: The society is permitted
by provincial law to charge the same înterest
rates as the short-termi ban companiesHon. Mr. Haig: Personal boan companies.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Personai loan companieswhich is 12 per cent. Of course in a cooperative the members are free to decide
amongst themselves the rate to be charged,
and I think in most cases it is nearer 6 per
cent than 12 per cent. It may vary according
to the security pledged, wbich, although it
may differ from that required by legisiation
governing banks. it is always adequate to
cover a particular boan.
In the resuit, members who deposit their
money in a credit union get at least three
times the interest they would get on bank
deposits; and when members borrow I should
think they would expect to pay as much as
or perhaps a littie more than bank intercst
on loans.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Are the boans made
by the local unions or by the society?
Hon. Mr. Farris: That information could be
butter secured frum Mr. MacGregor, the
Superintendent of Insurance, but my understanding is that the boans are made through
the provincial society. I do not have before
me the information that the local unions may
make boans directly to their membership. I
may say, however, that I only received
instructions on this legislation after eleven
o'clock this morning.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Do I understand that the
credit union is the primary organization?
Hon. Mr. Farris: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Haig: And it can iend mnoney to
its own members?
Hon. Mr. Farris: The primary organization
is the union; the body at the provincial level
is called the society; and when these two
bis become baw there will be a federal
association.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: Is this the set-up:

first there is the primary organization, that
is the local credit union; secondly, the regional
body; and thirdly, there will in time be a

Hon. Mr. Farris: Yes and no. The Bank
Act applies to existing banks, which are
incorporated by private acts of parliament.
The proposed new general act now under

direct analogy in that sense.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Banks have federal

Hon. Mr. Farris: Yes. Banks and banking
c-orne under section 91 of the British North
America Act. The distinction, of course, is
that the provisions here as to the restrictions
and regulations are in many cases basically
different from those in the Banking Act, and
most desirably so. As I have already pointed
out, the statutes that are the pattern for these
regulations here are the federal Loan Companies Act and the Trust Companies Act.
Mr. MacGregor has, I think, incorporated in
the bill practically every applicable provision
of those ýacts. He has, in addition, taken
extracts fromn the Insurance Act, and partîcularly frorn the Companies Act.
One or two amendments were made to the
bill in the House of Commons, but I do not

man. That is my first objection to this legislation.
My second objection is that I am not satisfied that money deposited with, say, the
provincial society of Manitoba should be sent
to, for instance, Ottawa, to be loaned in the
province of Ontario. However good the credit
of Ontario may beHon. Mr. Campbell: It has the best security.
Hon. Mr. Haig: -I do not think Manitoba
people should be called upon to lend cash to
the people of this province.
Hon. Mr. Farris: It may work the other way.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Exactly; it would be better
if Ontario lent money to Manitoba.
The feeling has existed in what I might
call the outlying provinces-that is the
Prairie and the Maritime provinces-that the
financial business of Canada has been too
greatly centralized in the provinces of Ontario
and Quebec; and that as a result the outlying
provinces do not get the same attention paid
to their needs as do the central provinces.
I do not pretend that if I were the head of
a large financial institution in Quebec or
Ontario I would have any more consideration
for the eastern or western provinces. Be
that as it may, I feel that the money deposited
with a provincial society should be loaned
only in that province, and that in lending
money the manager should be influenced by
nothing except his good judgment. Whether
that is possible in the kind of organization
where everybody is the boss and nobody is
the boss, I do not know. Some of these
unions have paid off companies with which
I had something to do; and when I asked the
man who handled the loan, "Why did you
accept the obligation and pay off the liability?" I was told "Well, that man is a member
of a union, he has paid in a lot of money to
the organization, he needs the loan, and we
are prepared to advance the $2,500"-or whatever the amount that might be due. In one
case, knowing something about the security,
I was doubtful of its value.
Under the circumstances, human nature
being what it is, that sort of thing may be
expected. The organization is not big enough
to pay fully experienced men salaries such
as they would require; and those who head the
unions have not the necessary background of
training. I have never forgotten the advice
of a former colleague, the late Senator Ballantyne, who, when I asked him "How do
you decide where to invest your money?",
replied, "I find out who is the manager, and
if he is a good man I back him. No matter
what his undertaking is, it will be a success."
In my city, from 1930 to 1935, when conditions were almost at their worst, one of the
68112-351j

largest retail stores made a profit every year.
Its prices were no higher than those of its
competitors, but the manager had the faculty
of knowing when, where and what to buy,
and how large a load the business should
carry.
I want to be sure that this bill has some
teeth in it; that the Superintendent of Insurance, or whoever is appointed to supervise
these societies, will have the power to put
any necessary checks on the unions when
difficulties are likely to arise. It cannot be
assumed that property values will go on rising. Let us say that ten years ago, on a
house then worth $5,000, someone made a
ban of $4,000.
Compared with the then
value of the property, the ban would be too
large, but today that house may well be
worth $10,000. As my honourable friend the
Chief Government Whip in this bouse (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien) knows, land in his county
which not long ago was selling for $30 an
acre is now saleable at about $100 an acre,
and if an advance had been made to the ful
limit of its former value, the ban would
seem small enough now. But wait till the
tide turns. I have seen it turn before. I
saw the value of horses and stocks and farms
go up between 1920 and 1929, and then I saw
prices go down. The same thing can happen
again. So I repeat that the bill should assure
to the Superintendent of Insurance, or whoever is his appointee, full control over the
operations of the unions.
At this point may I make an explanation?

some time ago are now accusing me of being
a centralizer, while the members of the credit
unions of the other provinces accuse me of
being an isolationist. I am neither; I am a
realist.
I wish to address my last remarks as a
grateful tribute to the founder of our caisses
populaires and credit unions in America-le
Commandeur Alphonse Desjardins. I also wish
to congratulate St. Francis Xavier University,
at Antigonish, which, during some twenty
years, has promoted the credit unions in our
Canadian centers. May I also add that this
year the university at Antigonish is celebrating the centenary of its foundation. I am
happy to congratulate this institution and
voice my appreciation of the admirable educational work it has achieved during the last
few years.
The first caisse populaire was founded in
Lévis on December 6, 1900, and had an initial
deposit of 10 cents; but today there are in
Canada alone 3,121 caisses populaires and
credit unions, with assets exceeding $360
million.
These caisses populaires and credit unions
have always worked for a good purpose. I
for one-and you will all agree with mewould not like to see any financial loss or
economic depression brought about through
a change in the basic principles and modes
of operating of the caisses populaires and
credit unions.
I will not vote against Bill 338, because I
do not claim that I have a monopoly on wisdom and infallibility. If some credit union
groups from the nine other provinces wish
this bill to be adopted, I cannot object, for
that is their privilege. However, according
to our own experience and that of other
countries, we in Quebec believe that the principle involved herein is extremely dangerous.
My most sincere wish is that the caisses
populaires of Quebec-I need not mention
the others-may continue to operate and
progress in conformity with the intentions
and directives of their founder, and that
they may always protect the interests of their
members without ever harming anyone.
Honourable senators, I should like now to
reply to some remarks made by the honourable gentleman from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck) as to the constitutionality of
certain laws.
In 1909 a measure similar to the present
bill was presented in the Senate, and was
rejected; there were 19 votes against the
law, and 18 votes for it.
The leader on the other side (Hon. Mr.
Haig) remarked that this type of organization does well if the manager is good. I

cannot speak for the other provinces, but in
Quebec all local caisses populaires are
operated by three boards-a board of directors, a loan board and a supervisory boardand any loan can be granted if it is approved
by the credit board commissioner. The manager himself cannot decide to loan money to
any member. In Quebec we have 48 inspectors provided by the federation of the caisses
populaires, and practically the same number
used by the ten unions. In addition, every
manager is bonded for an amount depending
on the importance of the caisse populaire;
that is, a bond for the manager of a caisse
with assets of $1 million is larger than that
for a man who is managing assets of only
$10,000.
We also have bonds protecting
against holdups, thefts, and so on.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: You have no bonds
against bad judgment, I take it?
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: We have not gone
that far.
There is no competition at all in Quebec
between the banks and caisses populaires,
because we give a service that the banks
cannot render. Thebanks cannotlpnA ne
on mortgages, but we lend small amounts on
this security all the time. We help our members. The basic principle of caisses populaires
is to use the money where it was earned,
so as to help develop the farms and assist
labourers in the cities, and so on, because
it is absolutely inconsistent to take money
from the land and use it for manufacturing
purposes. We have no millionaires in our
caisses populaires. All the members of the
organization are farmers, labouring men, and
the like; therefore, we have no right to take
any unnecessary risks with their money, and
certainly we should not speculate with it.
The money represents savings from the labour
o! our people, and we regard ourselves as
absolutely bound to refund a member's money
at any time that he asks for it.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I have just one or two observations to
make. I do not want to stand in the position
of one who is sounding an alarm, but I do
view the progress that is no doubt being
made by this organization with a certain
degree of apprehension. These credit unions
have grown out of little credit societies. When
I first became acquainted with them in the
city of Toronto and elsewhere I was somewhat
surprised. Down in the poorer sections of
that city you will find little societies composed
of a chairman, or a president, and a secretarytreasurer, with some small amount of funds
in their possession. I met the people who
were actually loaning the money. The loans
were confined to people in small groups. I met

particularly true as applied to the loaning

of the organization were a little black-covered
notebook that fitted into his vest pocket. In
the notebook was a list of names, and opposite these were the amounts of the borrowings. It was surprising to me that such an
operation was possible, but I was more surprised when I learned that these little societies
suffered practically no losses. The reason for
that, of course, lay in the loyalty of the
member to the group to which he belonged,
and the stern disapproval of his neighbours
and friends that he would incur, should he
borrow from that little society and not pay
back.
Little societies of that kind have a philanthropic purpose. Many loans are made on
account of sickness, and the people who
receive them struggle hard to pay them back.
These societies have been a great success, and
apparently out of them have grown the credit
unions. But now, instead of an individual
doing this work as a charitable contribution
to his neighbourhood, men are loaning money
as a commercial proposition, and in very large
figures. There is now a total of $400 million
in the hands of these men, most of whom no
doubt, have very little experience in the business they are carrying on, although they have
been fairly successful so far.
Now, what is the proposal? The little
society supported by local loyalties is te
become a big, top-heavy organization with a
managing board, whose members probably
have but little more experience than those
who are carrying on the business. And we are
to have an interchange of money from province to province, and from society to society,
so that the whole organization will be one
great interlinked and interdependent system
of accounting of debits and credits. Well, it
may serve a good purpose. Centralization
sometimes serves a good purpose, but my
honourable friend from Kennebec (Hon. Mr.
Vaillancourt) warns that it is sometimes
dangerous-very dangerous. Under this proposal money raised in, for instance, the province of Ontario, may be loaned in the province
of Saskatchewan, or Alberta or British Columbia, for purposes quite unknown to those who
deposited the money. Is it not possible that
instead of having small cells, the one independent of the other, and the failure of one of
which would not do much harm, we shall have
a big body which, if the props are removed,
will come tumbling down with a crash? It
seems to me we are assuming a great responsibility in granting incorporation under these
circumstances.
My honourable friend from Kennebec has
told us that the success of credit organizations

case of the larger organizations it is not so
much the managers-and there will be scores
of them-but rather the general manager.
It has been said that the Superintendent of
Insurance will keep his eye on these various
societies across Canada. How can be effectively supervise them all? He may know a
good deal about insurance, but I am not aware
that be is familiar with finance, and he may
be still less familiar with the operations of
loaning societies. Even if he knows all there
is in the book, he is just one person who is
supposed to keep his eye on all these little
organizations spread across Canada, with the
exception of those in the province of Quebec,
which may be wise enough to look after its
own.
I want it clearly on the record that I view
with alarm the proposed incorporation of
these societies. When the bill is considered
in committee we should pay particular attention to the provision for the management of
the multifarious transactions which will take
place across Canada, each one capable of
bearing the seeds of disaster.

legislation?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: The government of

request of the credit union societies.
May I say to my honourable friends that
during the comparatively long period when
I was in provincial public life I had a very
good opportunity to study the workings of
the credit unions in the province of Nova
Scotia, and I know that they were most
helpful in that province.
I would be remiss in my duty if I did not
also take this opportunity to refer to the great
work of Saint Francis Xavier University in
this co-operative movement. ILt has done
excellent work in helping thousands of people,

APRIL 29, 1953
both in rural and urban districts, whose
standard of living has been raised through
co-operatives and credit societies. Father
"Jimmy" Tompkins, Monseigneur M. M.
Coady and A. B. Macdonald will always be
remembered as the fathers of this movement.
They, along with many of the clergy in
numerous parishes, particularly in Nova
Scotia, spearheaded this great movement
which has spread all over the country and
has meant so much to the comfort and the
well-being of our citizens. With those I have
already mentioned as leaders of this movement I would include Fathers Gillis,
McCormick, George McLean, Forrest and
Boyle-the latter now Bishop of Prince
Edward Island.
May I take your time, honourable senators,
to tell briefly of the doings of one of these
clergymen, as it will illustrate what has been
accomplished. When Father Forrest went to
Larry's River, Guysborough County, most of
his one hundred-odd families were on direct
relief. The priest did not have much capital,
but his credit was good, and he succeeded
in purchasing a second-hand sawmill. He
took some of his men into the woods and they
first cut and sawed lumber for a lobster factory. When it was built, some of the women
operated the factory while the men were
fishing. Then when the blueberries were
ripe, many of the women and children picked
the berries and canned them. The same procedure was followed with the wild cranberries or foxberries. Father Forrest then
sold the products, mainly in Montreal.
In a short time he had assisted his people,
with their combined help through their cooperatives, to become self-supporting, and
they no longer needed to take aid from government sources.
They also improved their community in
many ways, including the construction of a
new schoolhouse and community hall.
That is only one of many stories that can
be told of the great good done by helping
Credit
people to establish their credit.
unions have done excellent work in many of
our centres, and knowing something of their
accomplishments in the province of Nova
Scotia, it is with pleasure that I support
this progressive legislation.
Hon. G. P. Burchill: Honourable senators,
may I take just a moment of your time to
say that I agree entirely with the remarks
of the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) as to the cause
for apprebension that we may by the passage of this bill be going a little farther than
I
is necessary at the present time.
should also like to congratulate the honourable senator from Kennebec (Hon. Mr.

Vaillancourt) upon the success he has had in
his own co-operative movement. And may I
compliment the honourable senator from
King's (Hon. Mr. McDonald) on his remarks
about the great good done by co-operative
movements in the province of Nova Scotia.
And, I may add, they have done much good
in the province of New Brunswick also.
I am all in favour of legislation that will
help the ordinary man get the financial
assistance he needs, but I am wondering
whether, as has. been so well stated by the
senator from Toronto-Trinity, in this legislation we are going farther than is necessary.
In my little community a credit union has
been functioning for some years and has done
an immense amount of good, because its
operations have been closely supervised by
local officers who know the people to whom
loans are made and are familiar generally
with the transactions. The same thing can
be said of numberless communities. In the
county from which I come are several credit
unions, all of which have been very successful, but I would stress the fact that their
officers have local knowledge and are familiar
with everything in connection with their
organization. For the life of me I cannot
understand why the honourable member for
King's (Hon. Mr. McDonald) has not explained how this legislation will benefit the
co-operative movement in Nova Scotia.
-Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It will get money from
Ontario.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I cannot figure out how
money which is accumulated in Alberta or
Ontario will be loaned to co-operatives in
Nova Scotia and Quebec, or what practical
help they can expect from a measure of this
kind. So far our unions have done very well.
I have yet to be convinced that the bill we
are discussing this afternoon will be of any
assistance. In my opinion it will not. I hope
I am wrong.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
anyone who has listened to the discussion
this afternoon must admit that he has
received a favourable impression of the good
done by credit unions. I was particularly
impressed with the remarks made by the
honourable senator from King's (Hon. Mr.
McDonald), who outlined their beginnings
and the circumstances under which they
began; and I have heard nothing but good of
the organization in my own province. But
a question which was put to the honourable
senator from King's aroused my curiosity. It
was not fully answered, and I think it should
be answered before the bill is proceeded
with. The question was, in. effect, "Who
asked for this legislation?" The honourable

SENATE

member's first answer was, "The government", and then, I think he said, "At the
request of iie eiedit unions." Thi:;oraises a
most important point. If the credit unions
in general, who have been doing such good
work, are pressing for legislation of this kind,
the fact should be clearly stated; but if the
unions are doing so well and getting so much
money into their hands I think we are
entitled to a much fuller explanation before
this bill goes much further.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: I can answer the
honourable senator's question. For the past
three years some groups, located in seven
different provinces, but not representing ail
the unions in those provinces, have asked for
the passing of this legislation.
Hon. Mr. Reid: But not ail the groups asked
for it.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: No. As I say, some
groups from seven provinces.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: How about Quebec?
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: No, we did not
touch that matter.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Quebec does not support the bill.
Hon. Mr. Reid: How are the unions held
back through not having legislation of this
kind?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: May I say an additional word or two? I can assure the honourable member from New Westminster (Hon.
Mr. Reid) and the honourable member from
Northumberland (Hon. Mr. Burchili) that
the provincial groups which have asked for
this legislation did so because they felt that
there is a need which they cannot meet in
any way other than by bemg able to inenrpurate under~a dominion charter so that
unions in a province which have money to
n
spare can loan a in puarters wher it
1e used to great advantage, and thus help
in a larger way to raise the standards of
living of many of these people.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I have been rather confused ahl through the speeches by references
to $400 million of assets and $200 million of
assets. Surely these figures do not represent assets. The unions have not made ail
that money. What is meant is that, of the
money which was deposited with them by
shareholders, loans in these amounts are outstanding. I cannot conceive of these organizations having assets in the amount of $400
million.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: The reference is to their
deposits.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: They are not ail assets.
We have not been told what their liabilities
Hon. Mr. Farris: My honourable friend is
quite right: they are not assets in the sense
of accumulated profits. In a memorandum in
this connection which was prepared this
morning it is stated that there are more than
one million members of Canadian credirt
unions, and that in 1951 their combined assets
exceeded $385 million. They now amount to
more than $400 million.
Hon. Mr. Pirie: That does not include
Quebec?
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: Yes, it does.
Hon. Mr. Farris: May I direct one observation particularly to my honourable friends
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)
and Northumberland (Hon. Mr. Burchil), who
seem apprehensive at the idea that the system
may become too cumbersome, and think that
loans should be confined to the immediate
vicinity of the loaning unit. It struck me
that the situation might be comparable ýto
that of the banking systems of the United
States and Canada. I recall some years ago
a conversation with a close friend of mine who
was manager of a bank in the State of Washington. He said: "Your Canadian banks
cannot compare with ours. We do not get
directions from Washington as Canadian
bankers get theirs from Montreal or Toronto.
We have our own little bank right here."
He was speaking of the town of New Waterton. He continued, "I know ail my people, and
I make loans to promote local interests on
the basis of my local knowledge." There is
something to that point of view. On the
other hand, there are a great many favourable comments on the banking system of
Canada, wherein the combined operations of
ail the provinces are used for the development
of ail Canada.
I think there is a great deal in the larger
concention. We are not a little group of
hives, each concerned only with the welfare
of our own hive. Over and above ail is the
aim to develop this dominion. If the concept
of a common provision for the needs of the
world at large has any justification, the outlook for world progress would indeed be discouraging were we in Canada unable to cooperate to the extent that citizens of one part
of the dominion who were enjoying good
times could make money available for some
province which at the time was not sharing
the same degree of prosperity. I think there
is a basic principle involved here, and I am
sorry to say that I must disagree with my
honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck) in that respect.

He said: Honourable senators, much of

I understand that seven proi rchah centrals
have expressed their desire for this legislation, and have by votes at their provincial
conventions endorsed the dominion-wide
organization which is being created by this
bill.

The provincial directors representing the
organizations seeking incorporation uAder this
bill are:
Abram W. Friesen. Farmer, of Rosthern. li the

province of Saskatchewan, John Riley Robinson,
Manager, of Vancouver, in the province of British
Columbia, Norman Flaxman Priestly, Secretary, of
Calgary, in the province of Alberta, Thheodore

Saskatchewan, Wilford John McSorley, Fariner, of
Winnipeg, in the province of Manitoba, Ralph
Sharpe Staples, Manager, of Toronto, in the province of Ontario, and Daniel MacCormack, Clergyman, of Antigonish, in the province of Nova Scotia,
together with such persons as become members of
the association hereby incorporated are incorporated
under the name of Canadian Co-operative Credit
Society Limited, hereinafter called "'the Association".

The capital stock of the association is $1
million, divided into 10,000 shares having a
par value of $100 each.
Section 5 of the bill reads:
The association shail not accept money on deposit,
or iend money or otherwise carry on business
until
(a) the board of directors has been duly elected
or appointed;
(b> not less than two hundred and flty thousand dollars of its capital stock has been bona fide

and all liabilities of the association in connection
with or arising out of the incorporation, procuring
of subscriptions, organization or otherwise howsoever; and
(d) all other requirements of the Co-operative
Credit Associations Act antecedent to the granting
of a certificate have been compiled with.

I would like to add a few words about the
directors whom I have named, their occupations and their businesses:
Mr. Abram W. Friesen is a Rosthern, Saskatchewan, farmer, a director of the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, and a past president of the
Co-operative Union of Saskatchewan.
Mr. John Ripley Robinson is the manager
of the British Columbia Central Credit Union
Limited, and has had a long association with
the credit union movement in that province.
Mr. Norman F. Priestley has been closely
associated with the co-operative movement in
Alberta for over twenty years. For fifteen
years, he was manager of the United Farmers
of Alberta Co-operative, and at present is
secretary of the Alberta Co-operative Union.
Mr. Theodore Kober is manager of the
Saskatchewan Co-operative Credit Society
and secretary of the Saskatchewan Co-operative Trust Company.
Mr. Wilford J. McSorley is president of the
Manitoba Co-operative Wholesale Society and
has had a long association with the consumer
co-operative movement in Manitoba.
Mr. Ralph Sharpe Staples is president of
the Co-operative Union of Canada, as well as
president of the Ontario Co-operative Credit
Society.
Reverend Daniel MacCormack is director
of Radio Education for the Extension Department of St. Francis Xavier University in
Antigonish, N.S., and has long been intimately
associated with the co-operative and credit
union movement of that province.
These provisional directors, who are also
the incorporators, are as you will readily see,
capable and experienced men, and represent
all sections of Canada as well as the credit
societies which have expressed their intention
of becoming members of the new organization
when it is formed.
The provincial credit societies which will
participate in the new company are named
in the schedule attached to this bill. They
are:
Saskatchewan Co-operative Credit Society
Limited, with head office at Regina, in the
province of Saskatchewan; Nova Scotia Credit
Union League Limited, with head office at
Antigonish, in the province of Nova Scotia;

B. C. Central Credit Union, with head
office at Vancouver, in the province of British
uoiumbia,
Ontario Co-operative Credit Society, with
head office at Toronto, in the province of
Ontario;
Prince Edward Island Credit Union League
Limited, with head office at Charlottetown,
in the province of Prince Edward Island;
Alberta Central Credit Union Limited; with
head office at Calgary, in the province of
Alberta;
Co-operative Credit Society of Manitoba
Limited, with head office at Winnipeg, in the
province of Manitoba.
I also understand that three commercial cooperative organizations have signified their
intention of becoming members of this new
association.
The main reason why I was anxious to
get this before the Senate this afternoon is
that, as honourable senators will see, it is
closely interwoven with ithe general bill, Bill
338, which was explained by the senator
from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris). That
bill has been referred to the Banking and
Commerce Committee, which will be meeting tomorrow; the officials who will be there
to answer questions on the general bill are
the same ones whom it will be necessary to
question on this 'private bill. It seemed to
me, therefore, that it would be reasonable
to consider these two bills in committee
together. I intend ta move, after this bill is
read the second time, that it be referred to
the Banking and Commerce Committee. On
the other hand, if there is still a desire to
hold it over, I will have no further objection.
I understand that in order to get this before
the committee tomorrow I will need the
unanimous consent of the Senate.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

might be advisable towards the close of a

Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable

Hon. Mr. Lamberi: -I take this opportunity
to apologize to those who are not members
of the Banking and Commerce Committee for
the delay in beginning this sitting of the

that the Senate sitting be deferred briefly
while honourable members of the committee
endeavoured to finish their study of the legislation before it. It was thought that this
would facilitate the work of the bouse.
I agree with the honourable gentleman
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) that
we were possibly guilty of not adhering
strictly to the rules, and I hope that it will
not occur again.

INCOME TAX BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Hayden presented the report of
the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce on Bill 228, an Act to amend the
Income Tax Act.

The report was read by the Clerk Assistant
as follows:
The Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce to whom was referred the Bill (228 from the
House of Commons), intituled: "An Act to amend
the Income Tax Act", have in obedience to the
order of reference of April 16, 1953, examined the
said bill and now beg leave to report the same with
the following amendments:
1. Page 28, line 5: strike out the words "subsections are".
2. Page 28, lines 7 to 19: strike out lines 7 to 19
both inclusive.
3. Page 61, line 9: strike out the words "subsections are".
4. Page 61, lines 1i to 22: strike out lines 11 to
22 both inclusive.

The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, when shall these amendments be
taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I move that the amendments be concurred in now.
Honourable senators, I think I should make
a brief statement to the house on the second
amendment. It strikes out that part of section 37 which had to do with apportionment
of the interest on any bonds sold by a nonresident vendor between interest dates to a
resident purchaser. That part of the section
provided for a withholding tax which the
purchaser of the bonds had to withhold out of
the moneys paid to the non-resident vendor.
There were representations before our com-

mittee from the Investment Dealers Association that this would create complications in
their business operations. We also heard the

Minister of Finance in connection with this

section, and the committee's amendment has
his approval.

have had to come about sooner or later
I do not want to give the impression that
because, for one thing, it cost a certain amount I am entirely opposed to the C.B.C., for I

APRIL 30, 1953
am not. I believe it has carried out its duties
under the act fairly, besides providing some
splendid programs. However, I feel that
the narrow attitude which the C.B.C. has
taken of late may alienate the good will
towards it which has been built up in many
quarters. The purpose of the corporation's
latest move on television, with which I will
deal, would almost justify one in believing
that it wants to place a curtain around this
country ta prevent any material coming into
Canada from across the line. If that is the
object, it will be resented by Canadians
generally.
I have not much to say about the programs
themselves, but I accuse the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation of including in some
of its broadcasts items which, though doubtless not sa intended, are helpful ta Soviet
Russia. Why should lies be circulated over
the air? For instance, recently publicity was
given ta a statement from a Russian or
Chinese Communist source that the United
States government took 600 Koreans ta the
United States and subjected thern for test
purposes ta the atomic bomb; also that the
American's had put out the eyes of a thousand
North Koreans. I do not believe that the
truth can always overtake propaganda of
that kind, and if falsehoods are repeated frequently enough, there might be people in
this country who will conclude that there is
some truth in them. Another statement ta
which publicity was given by the C.B.C. was
with regard ta "germ warfare". Is there
any honourable senator who believes that the
American Army uses germs against the enemy
in Korea, or puts out the eyes of North
Koreans, or exposes the enemy ta the dangers
of atomic bombing experiments? Then, I ask,
why tell these lies over the air? If they are
untrue, and they are, why repeat them? Of
course the Russians are happy ta know that
reports of this kind are being circulated in
North America, because there are peopleone may call them simple-minded-who, lis·tening ta this sort of thing, say "Well, we
heard it, or something similar ta it, on the
air", or "We read an article about it in the
press," and for that reason may and do
accept it. We all know persans who, when
some report is questioned, say, "Oh, I believe
it because I read it in the newspaper," and
"If it is in the press it must be true."
I will not repeat what I have said many
times about Mr. Dunton's attitude ta the socalled "soap" programs. I suggest he come
down from his high pedestal and look at
these things as they really are. Somebody
dramatizes the "triangle" motive; someone is
courting another man's wife; the dialogue is
so charged with emotion that one can hear
the sobbing over the air. Apparently the

C.B.C. regards this as art. It might be well
if our special committee which is inquiring
into obscene and salacious literature took
some note of programs of this kind. To my
mind they do much harm, even though Mr.
Dunton thinks otherwise.
I am one of those who hold that attempts
by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ta
control entirely both television and radio are
detrimental ta Canadian interests. In this
connection I shall say something of which I
have personal knowledge and which, so far
as I know, has not been said before. The
C.B.C. is supposed ta protect private stations
in the matter of its channels and lines. The
protection of channels or lines for radio
in Canada is, I believe, one of the main
subjects discussed in conferences of representatives of North American countries, but
I believe that the C.B.C. pays no attention to
the channels distributed in the United States
ta private lines so long as these do not interfere with the corporation's own communications. In the province from which I come,
especially in the Greater Vancouver and
New Westminster area, our private radio stations are faced, particularly in the evenings,
with interference from two or three stations
across the line, and frequently the Canadian
private programs are blacked out. But the
C.B.C.'s own lines never suffer from that
kind of interference. I wonder whether this
is a pursuance of a policy of the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation ta induce or compel
the public, deprived of other programs, ta
turn ta those of the corporation. Personally
I should like ta know why the private stations
have been subjected in the past five or six
years ta interference from radio stations
across the line. I repeat that stations in the
United States have been permitted ta secure
"spots" which interfere very seriously with
many stations in British Columbia.
As for television, the official policy which
has been enunciated and is being put into
effect in British Columbia has made the people
of that province very angry indeed. I would
not be surprised if it becomes a major subject of political controversy during the forthcoming election.
The C.B.C. is now erecting a television
station in the city of Ottawa. I think Ottawa
is entitled to it. But whereas Ottawans are
ta enjoy within a month the facilities of this
station, so that they will be able ta view the
Coronation, we in Vancouver, where the
rights of private television stations are
denied, will not see the Coronation through
Canadian television but through the service of
United States stations nearby. Now, if the
abject of the C.B.C. policy ta designate certain large centres as alone entitled ta television facilities, and ta prohibit until some

tions, is

the

entrance

sta-

to United

States television, I say it will never do what
the C.B.C. expects it to do.
Take the case of Vancouver. Within the
next few weeks a station costing between
one and a half and two million dollars will
be completed at Bellingham, a nearby city
in the United States. Already the proprietors
are advertising the station in British
Columbia stores, and recommending people
to procure a set at once, because within a
month they will be able to tune in to BellingAs a result, this station is receiving

considerable public support and promises of
advertising from merchants in Vancouver
and New Westminster. The Bellingham station has made it clear that the greater proportion of its programs will be Canadian produced for Canadian viewers. It is little
wonder that the people in British Columbia
feel irritated, if not angry, over this kind
of policy. They cannot understand why private interests, which are willing to spend
their own money to erect television stations,
are not allowed to go ahead. It means that
we shall probably have to wait until January
or February of next year for our television
reception, while three cities in Canada are
enjoying it in the meantime and American
stations are capturing the market.
I am not arguing the merits or demerits of
television at all. I know there is a doubt
in the minds of many people as to whether
television will prove beneficial to the human
race.
Honourable senators, there is no doubt
that the owners of television sets in Montreal
and Toronto are viewing more programs that
originate in the United States than originate
in Canada. On my last trip to Ottawa I was
held up at the Toronto airport for some two
hours, and I was rather surprised to see that
the Trans-Canada Airlines, a governmentowned institution, was providing American
television programs for delayed passengers.
It might have been that the American programs were better than what the Canadian
station was showing. I am wondering if
the C.B.C. purposes to put some kind of an
iron curtain around Canada so as to keep
out American television programs. If this is
so, then I think the people of Canada should
be told; at any rate, I do not believe this
can be accomplished.
As I said at the outset of my remarks, I
am not opposed to the city of Ottawa being
given television privileges even ahead of my
own province of British Columbia. After all,
Ottawa is the capital of Canada.
I was rather amused a short while ago
when I read in the press that Ottawans

were to be virtually prohibited from installing outside television aerials after the C.B.C.
had

started

its local

television

b±uajcts

this summer. Apparently a mistake had
previously been made in the bylaw, and the
city council endeavoured to rectify that mistake one or two nights later. Even at that,
a person has to apply to the civic building
inspector if he wants to put up an aerial, and
he will have to prove that the equipment is
necessary to provide adequate reception of
outside television. Furthermore, all applications have to be given routine approval and
be passed on to the Board of Control and City
Council for sanction. The civic officials have
said that they want to avoid a "forest of
aerials" that would spoil the city's appearance. When one looks over Ottawa now and
sees all the poles, and telephone, telegraph
and electric wires that are strung about the
city one wonders how a few more TV aerials
on roof tops could add to the present eyesore.
I realize I perhaps stand on risky ground
when I say anything about the city of
Ottawa, for apparently some members of the
City Council resent the least bit of criticism.
I made a certain remark a short time ago
and was criticized for it. I have never taken
issue in public as to remarks made about
myself, but I think I am entitled to tell the
Mayor and members of the City Council
that so long as this city is looking for handouts from the dominion government, and so
long as the taxpayers of Canada are called
upon to contribute to these handouts, we
who are not from Ottawa have some right
to say something about the city. I have
never attempted, by anything I have said,
to run down the city, for as everyone knows
there is hardly any city or town that has
not got something that could be criticized.
The Mayor said that she could not understand why people scrambled after senatorial
appointments if they did not like living in
the city of Ottawa. She directed her barb
at me, and I should like to reply to Her
Worship that I never did any scrambling
for an appointment to this chamber. I have
been in public life since 1922. I first came
to Ottawa as a member of parliament in 1930,
and I can say with pardonable pride that
I have never had great difficulty in winning
an election. Shortly after the last election I
was summoned by the Prime Minister and,
without any solicitation on my part, he said
he wanted to appoint me to the Upper Chamber. Well, I have heard a lot of criticism
about the Senate, but I have never met a
man or woman in this country who would
refuse an appointment to this chamber. I
could have remained in the other house in
the capacity of Parliamentary Assistant to

APRIL 30, 1953
the Minister of National Health and Welfare
at an annual renumeration of $10,000, but
I have been long enough around the halls of
parliament to know that when the Prime
Minister summons you and says he would like
to appoint you to the Senate, you would be
turning down the appointment for all time
if you refused it then.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Opportunity knocks only
once.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes, and I was not that
foolish, to turn down the appointment. I have
always done my best to act in the interests
of the public in this honourable chamber. I can also say, without fear of contradiction, that since 1930 I have spent more days
in Ottawa than I have in and around New
Westminster. And I have never objected to
living in this city.
I do remember an occasion when I criticized the city of Ottawa, saying it had too
many aldermen and controllers to run the
business of the city smoothly and effectively.
All I can say is that I hope they do not
build their new city hall until they have cut
down the present number of aldermen and
controllers, otherwise it will be like the
building which houses the General Assembly
of the United Nations. They will simply be
putting up a new building to hold their
battles in. I was surprised that on that
previous occasion they seemed to take my
advice, for they reduced the number of aldermen from 26 to 18, but the number of controllers remained at four. However, I notice
they did not save any money, as those who
were left merely appropriated the balance of
the indemnities for themselves. I think that
the only saving to the city is something like
$100 a year.
And I say now that there are still too many
men and women on the Ottawa City Council.
Before coming here this afternoon, I looked
the matter up and learned that Toronto has
a mayor, five controllers, and nine aldermen.
Its population, I understand, is 1,200,000, and
its expenditures in 1951 were $76 million.
Vancouver, the third largest Canadian city,
bas a mayor, eight aldermen, and no controllers-a total of only nine to look after that
fair city with a population of more than
400,000, and expenditures last year of $35
million. But this capital city bas a mayor,
four other members on the Board of Control,
and eighteen aldermen, a total of twentythree looking after a population of just over
200,000, and expenditures last year of just
over $13 million. I would suggest in all
kindness to the Council of the City of Ottawa
that if it wants to get along more smoothly
and do its business better than it bas been
able to do it so far-as I understand from the
reports in the press-it should copy other

cities and cut down the number of its members still further. The more aldermen and
controllers you have, the more disputes there
are. This city could be run more efficiently
by a council of half the present number.
Regarding the television aerials I just have
one thing to say to the Mayor, and I say it not
in rancour. I remember a statement made by
Mr. Baldwin in the British House of Commons
to Mr. Snowden: "When a first-class brain
does something stupid, it not infrequently
happens that the stupidity is colossal."
An honourable member from Toronto bas
just reminded me that my remarks about
Toronto apply to metropolitan Toronto. I
thank him for drawing my attention to that.
As honourable senators know, in the early
days of radio some splendid recommendations
were made by the Aird Commission, although
at that time television was practically
unknown and the use of radio was by no
means as extensive as it is today. The commission recommended in its report that the
provinces be given a proper place in radio,
especially in regard to provincial educational
programs. That recommendation bas never
been carried out. I am surprised that the
provinces have not demanded a greater share
in radio educational programs. I realize it is
a very controversial subject, especially when
you begin to try to define what education is.
Generally speaking, of course, when we speak
of education we mean scholastic education,
not education in farm management or similar
subjects, which are discussed over the air
very frequently.
I do not want to delay honourable senators,
but I think it is important to place on the
record what Joseph Sedgwick, Q.C., had to
say-and I for one agree with him-regarding Royal Commissions. Speaking of the
Massey Commission's report, of which each
senator bas a copy, Mr. Sedgwick said:
If the appointing government finds that the report
suits its own views, it greets it with fulsome praise.
It speaks of the authors of the report as being
highly distinguished and unassailably competent,
and says that it would be unthinkable not to implement and adopt the recommendations of so sensible
and informed a body. If, as does sometimes
happen, the report fails to please the appointing
government, it is filed and forgotten and the
responsible minister points out (quite correctly)
that governments must make up their own mind,
and cannot abdicate their function to a Royal
Commission, even to one of their own appointing.
I have read the Massey report through
fairly well; I refer to it often, and all I can
see in it pertaining to radio and television
is just the odd thing that seems to suit the
C.B.C. And may I say to the honourable
the acting leader that while I was pleased
indeed to get an answer to my inquiry the
other day, I had wondered if I would actually
get the answers I asked for because last year

SENATE

when I placed two of the same questions on
the Order Paper the C.B.C., behind the scenes,
said it was not going to answer those questions. I stood on my rights as a senator and
said that if the C.B.C. wanted to live a
peaceable life it had better answer those questions. When that refusal was conveyed to
me I said, "Take it back and say 'Senator
Tom Reid demands an answer"'. The following day I received the answer-an admission
which the corporation had so long hesitated
to make; it was simply "No". I mention that
to show the attitude of some of these C.B.C.
officials to members of parliament.
Now, coming to some of the recommendations on the Massey report, I want to place
on the record something further that Joseph
Sedgwick had to say. It is quite apropos
the subject I am dealing with. He was
speaking of the personnel of that royal commission. I personally did protest and object
because there were no common citizens, shall
I say, on that commission, that all who were
appointed as commissioners to delve into arts
and letters, as well as radio and television,
were highbrows, as they are called. Speaking
of the commission, Mr. Sedgwick said:
Does there not seem to be here too much of the
cloister in the campus, and not enough of market
place and street?

I concede that, so long as the commissioners
dealt with education, the arts and sciences,
no more competent group could have been
found. However, in dealing with such matters
as radio and television, I think, with great
respect, that they were not competent at all.
Those who prescribe for the masses should
at least know the masses, even if they are not
among them. On this commission there
should have been at least one real down-toearth politician, one who had to fight his
way through a number of elections. I am
speaking for the masses when I rise in my
place here and now and speak about the
attitude of the C.B.C. on radio and television.
It has been said that the C.B.C. has a
monopoly in radio. There is no such thing
as a monopoly in radio in this country,
because there are many private stations as
well as the C.B.C. But, as Mr. Sedgwick said:
The net result of all this is that CBC has a
monopoly all right, but only in the sense that it
excludes Canadian competition; in the meantime it
is giving a very real monoply of a Canadian audience to the TV stations of Buffalo and nearby U.S.

I think that pretty well sums up my
thoughts on the C.B.C.'s television programs.
We in British Columbia have been greatly
discriminated against. Up to the present
time more than $3ù million has been spent
for a television system in Montreal, and a
similar sum in respect of the Toronto station.
How much the Ottawa installation will cost

remains to be seen; however, the capital is in
a somewhat special category. But all this

payer, and with a total annual expenditure of
$26 million he need look no farther to discover why his taxes are going up. As I have
said, the C.B.C. has now become a creature of
the government, and the government must
take responsibility for it. If the Canadian
government intends to compete with television in the United States, which is financed
by private industry, the people of this country must provide for the cost with everincreasing taxation.
In a few short years expenditures have
risen from $3 million to the present figure of
$26 million; and for this reason I deem it my
duty to stand up and say what I have said
this afternoon. After all, the people should
be the judges of what they want; and if honourable senators will look over the radio program surveys by the Haynes Company of
Toronto they will see that in most places, and
particularly in Montreal, Toronto, New Westminster, Vancouver and other Western cities,
C.B.C. has fewer listeners than any other
station. I made that statement when I was
a member of the committee of the other house
and it has never been contradicted.
I repeat my criticism of the committee of
the other house for not giving honourable
senators an opportunity to meet and discuss
with the officials the problems and expenditures arising under this bill. I do not
think that kind of treatment should be
countenanced.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Honourable senators, I
rise merely to congratulate the honourable
senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) upon the very interesting address he
has given. But while I am on my feet may
I express the hope that the present Mayor
of Ottawa will occupy a seat in this chamber
while the honourable senator is with us.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. Lambert: Honourable senators, I
move third reading now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
FINANCING AND GUARANTEE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. A. K. Hugessen moved the second
reading of Bill 363, an Act to authorize the
provision of moneys to meet certain capital

APRIL 30, 1953
expenditures of the Canadian National Railways systemn during the calendar year 1953,
and to authorize the guarantee by Her
Mai esty of certain securities to be issued by
the Canadian National Railway Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this is the
annual bill placed before parliament to prýovide for the financing requirement of the
Canadian National Railways for the current
year.
Honourable senators wlll remember that
last year the form of this legisiation was
changed so as to include the financing of al
capital expenditures for the railway company, whether authorized under the current
Act or under earlier financing and guaranteeing legisiation. That procedure is again followed this year.
The meat of the bill will be found in section 3. The section is divided into, four parts.
The first part authorizes the Canadian
National Railway to spend during the current year on capital account an amount Up
to $146 million odd; the second part of the
section would authorize the railway company
to acquire during the course of the current
year additional working capital up to $15
million; the third part authorizes the railway
company to make capital expenditures during
the first six months of next year-that is
1954-to
discharge
obligations
incurred
during this year, or preceding years, which
will faîl due for payment during those six
months; and the fourth part authorizes the
railway company to enter into obligations
covering its financial programi for the year
1954 in the amount of approximately $74
million.
These figures, honourable senators, appear
to be exceedingly large. It is true, however,
that to a large extent they do not represent
any new authorizations of expenditures by
this parliament; they refer to expenditures
to be made this year to cover authorizations that have been given by parliament in
prior years.
If honourable senators wiIl refer to section
3 of the bull, I will briefiy run over the
expenditures whi*ch are authorized by this
section.
First, the amount of approximately $47
million is authorized for additions and betterments other than new equipment; but of
that amount more than $35 million has
already been authorizeçi in previous acts,
and the only new authority asked for by this
bull is the balance of $12 million.
Provision is made for the expenditure of
slightly over $9 million for branch line construction. 0f that amount $2,700,000 is for

the Sherridon-Lynn Lake line, and $6,500,000
is for the Terrace-Kitimat line. Honourable
senators will recaîl that the authorization
for the construction of both those lînes was
gîven at previous sessions of parliament, and
that in both instances contracts have been
entered into between the Canadian National
Railways and the particular industries which
it is designed to benefit by the lines, which
industries guarantee to the railway suffidient revenue over a period of twenty years
to meet the interest charges on the -cost of
-construction.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask if these are
additional amounts?
Han. Mr. Hugessen: No; these are only the
amounts which are expected to be spent this
year for these two lines which have already
been authorîzed by parliament.
The next item is new equipment, for
which authorization is asked up to $89 million. 0f that sum $79 million represents
moneys to be spent for additional equipment
during this year, but which was previously
authorized by parliament during the years
1951 and 1952.
The only new money for which authorization is asked is the balance of slightly under
$10 million. That makes a total of $146 million.
In paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section
3 iýs the authorization to the company to
acquire additional working capital during
this year in an amount not exceeding $15
million. The reasons for which that authorization is asked are the following: owing to
the continued increase in the cost of materials
and supplies used in the operation of the
railway the amount of working capital which
is tied up in this way is constantly increasing. As at December 31 last, the amount of
cash actually available on hand to the railway
company amounted to slightly over four and
a haîf million dollars, to carry out operations
involving estimnated expenses of approximately $56 million per month during the
current year. It is an accepted principle
of industry that, as business expands, the
necessity of increased liquid assets immediately follows. In order to operate effectively, to pay bills promptly and take -advantage of discounts which may he offered, cash
must be available. The Canadian National
Railway Company is not in a position to
increase its working capital out of earnings,
since under the legislation now in force any
earnings in excess of the annual interest payments on its debt must be paid to the government by way of dividend on the government's
holdings of preferred stock of the railway
company. For these reasons it is considered

SENATE
necessary to provide an additional $15 million
nff
wnrkinga rapital to the company in the
course of the current year.
In paragraph (c) there is authorization
to make capital expenditures during the first
six months of 1954 to meet obligations already
authorized by this parliament either under
the present act or previous acts, to a total
not exceeding $80 million. That sounds like
a large sum, but I point out that the authorization is not a new one; it is merely intended
to enable the company to pay accounts which
will fall due in the period in question in
respect of authorizations already given by
this parliament.
Paragraph (d) relates to the capital expenditure program for the year 1954. It authorizes
the company to enter into commitments which
will become payable in 1954 or later years
to cover those capital expenditure programs
to a total of $74,500,000.
In other respects, honourable senators, this
bill follows practically word for word the
similar bill which was adopted by this House
last year. There is only one exception. The
total of obligations by way of bonds or
debentures or equipment trust certificates
which the company is authorized to issue
under this legislation is $221 million, but that
amount is to be decreased by the amount
which the company is authorized to issue, by
way of preferred stock, to the Minister of
Finance. Honoura'ble senators will recall that
last year, in the Canadian National Refinancing Act, it was provided generally that a
part of the capital obligations of the company
should be converted into what one might
call equity capital, in the form of 4 per cent
preferred stock, and further, that in each
year the company might raise its capital
requirements for that year by the sale of 4
per cent preferred stock-again to the Minister of Finance-to the extent of 3 per cent
of its gross earnings for that year. It is
estimated that the gross earnings of the
Canadian National Railways for the current
year will be of the order of $700 million. The
result will be that the total amount of bonds
and other obligations which the company
will bo authorized to issue under this bill,
totalling $221 million, will be reduced to
the extent of approximately $21 million by
the sale of that amount of 4 per cent preferred
stock to the Minister of Finance at par.
That, in brief, honourable senators, is the
bill that is now before you. I should like
to make one or two rather general observations arising out -of it.
The question has occurred to me, and I am
sure to other honourable senators, from time
to time and from year to year, as we are
asked to pass these bills warranting the
expenditure of sums which to ordinary men,

like you and me, seem quite astronomical,
whether as a country we are not going too
far in authorizing Uapial expcnditurcs by
the railway company.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: To put it in another
way, whether the company is not spending
too much capital. That is a very interesting
question, and I suppose the general answer
that can be made to it is that a railway is
never finished. Year after year there have
to be improvements, extensions of lines, additional equipment and additional facilities.
That is particularly true in the case of an
expanding economy such as is ours at the
present moment. I might give the house one
or two examples of that sort of thing which
are particularly appropriate at the present
juncture.
For instance, these new branch lines, Lynn
Lake and Kitimat, to which I made reference a few minutes ago, are essential to the
devel'opment of vitally important industries,
the expenditures for which will total something of the order of $25 million.
Another item relates to expenditures for
new equipment, particularly new passenger
equipment. The C.N.R. is very far behind in
this respect. As a matter of fact, I am
informed, until two or three years ago no
new passenger equipment had been purchased
by the Canadian National Railways since the
year 1935. The reason, of course, is obvious.
During the depression there was no need for
such equipment, and anyhow it was too
expensive, under the conditions then prevailing, for the company to purchase it. During the war it was impossible to acquire
new equipment; and that condition persisted
for another five years afterwards by reason
of shortages of steel and so forth, with the
result that during the past two or three years
the Canadian National Railways have been
faced with the problem of purchasing and
paying for a very large amount of new passenger equipment, amounting to many millions of dollars, which under normal
circumstances would have been spread over a
much longer period than the two or three
years within which that equipment must now
be paid for.
Another example is the program of dieselization of engines,-the conversion from steam
engines to diesel engines. The conversion
from steam engines to diesel engines is a program which is universal to the railways all
over this continent. It is extremely expensive, and in the case of the C.N.R. alone the
total expenditure for dieselization contemplated over a period of years is in the hundreds
of millions of dollars. Well, that is an extremely
expensive capital expenditure which this

APRIL 30, 1953
house has to contemplate on behalf of the
Canadian National Railway Company. It is
true, of course, that dieselization does bring
about very important economies in the operation of a railway, and that is particularly so
in long distance freight traffic and in the
shunting of freight in yards. It is to long
distance freight and yard freight that the
Canadian National Railways' dieselization
program is at the moment being largely
directed. There are, however, two or three
cases where a whole section of line has been
dieselized. For instance, steam engines have
been completely taken off the run from Matapedia to Gaspé. The whole line has been
dieselized at an annual saving of several
hundreds of thousands of dollars. In some
instances I am advised that the capital cost of
dieselization will be met by savings in operations in a period of not more than five or six
years.
Honourable senators, I spoke a moment ago
about the expanding economy of this country.
Very large capital expenditures are required
and have already been made in such places as
the Toronto and Montreal freight yards. It
can be seen that these things add up to
extremely heavy capital expenditures, but
even this explanation might not answer the
question which might arise in the minds of
some honourable senators: "Is the Canadian
National Railway perhaps not going a little
overboard in spending more money on capital
than it would if it were a privately-owned
company?" That is a very interesting question. I have been able to obtain some figures
about that which I think will interest the
house. I hold in my hand a table of the
property investments made by the Canadian
National Railways and the Canadian Pacific
Railway respectively, during the five-year
period from 1948 to 1952. With the leave of
the house I shall quote those figures to the
closest million.

I would ask honourable senators to relate
these amounts to the average mileage of the
two railways. As at the 31st of December
last, the Canadian National Railways operated
24,000 miles of line, and the Canadian Pacific
Railway 17,000 miles of line. Those are just
rough figures. In the result each railroad
has made approximately $3,000 of capital

expenditure for each mile of line operated
during the last five years.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It works out very evenly.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: It seems to indicate
that they have both been doing the same.
Furthermore, when talking about the great
capital expenditures of the railways I should
draw the attention of the Senate to a statement which appears in the annual report of
the Canadian Pacific Railway Company for
1952, which came out only a week or two ago.
It was reported that in the next five years,
from 1953 to 1957, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company will be faced with capital
expenditures of $475 million.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: For the operation of the
railways alone?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I really do not know,
but I think it can be said truthfully that the
vast bulk will be railway expenditures. The
figures I have just quoted to the house should
give some indication that the Canadian
National Railway Company is not going overboard in the making of capital expenditures,
certainly not in relation to its principal competitor, the Canadian Pacific Railway
Company.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Could the honourable
senator tell us what the public has been
spending on ordinary roads during the years
he referred to? That would be a good comparison, would it not?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I agree with my honourable friend that that would be an
extremely cogent comparison. I hope I have
satisfactorily answered the question that must
have been in the minds of honourable senators
as to whether the Canadian National Railway
Company would embark on such heavy capital
expenditures if it were a privately-owned
company. I do not believe that the Canadian
National Railway Company is engaging in
undue or excessive capital expenditures,
having regard to the problems with which it
is faced, and having regard also to the equally
vast capital expenditures which the Canadian
Pacific Railway Company has made over the
last five years, and which it will be called
upon to make in the next five.
I suppose one might finish this comparison
by making a very broad general statement.
According to the latest figures, the investment
of the people of Canada in the property
account of the Canadian National Railway
Company as of December 31 last amounted to
$2,436,000,000. During the last five years that
investment has been increasing at the average
rate of approximately $72 million. Having
regard to the fact that the gross annual
revenue of this country is running these days

SENATE
at a rate of something of the order of $20
hillion or more. I do not think that an increase
of $70 million each year in our capital investment in the Canadian National Railway Company can be considered to be excessive or out
of the way, particularly having regard to the
vital service which our transportation system,
our railway company, performs for the people
of this country.
Honourable senators, should this bill be
given second reading I will suggest that, as
in previous years, it be referred for further
consideration to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce. Officers of the railway company will be available in committee
to answer any questions that honourable
members may see fit to ask. This is our
annual chance to investigate the operation of
the Canadian National Railway Company, as
we have done each year when this financial
bill has been placed before us. I imagine
honourable members will again wish to take
advantage of this opportunity.
I think the tentative arrangements, subject
to the house agreeing to the second reading,
are that there shall be a meeting of the Standing Committee on Tuesday morning, at which
the officers of the railway will be present. I
have arranged with the clerk that there will
be made available to the honourable members of the Standing Committee on Banking
and Commerce, not later than Monday next,
copies of the document which the Canadian
National calls its annual budget for 1953,
showing its estimated receipts and expenditures and its estimates of capital commitments for that period.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Before the honourable
gentleman closes, may I ask a question about
something in this bill that seems very extraordinary, and to which the honourable senator made no reference. The bill is entitled
"An Act to authorize the provision of moneys
to meet certain capital expenditures of the
Canadian National Railway system during the
calendar year 1953"; and hidden among the
clauses of the bill to carry out the purpose
of the title I find an Ethiopian in the woodpile. If the honourable senator would look
at section 10, he will find that it says:
Where, at any time before the first day of July,
1954, the available revenues of Trans-Canada Air
Lines and its subsidiaries are not sufficient to pay
all the operating and income charges thereof as
and when due, the Minister of Finance, upon
application by Trans-Canada Air Lines approved
by the Minister of Trade and Commerce, may, with
the approval of the governor in council, place at
the disposal of the Trans-Canada Air Lines such
amounts as may be required to enable TransCanada Air Lines and its subsidiaries to meet all
such charges.

Why should a clause of that kind be
inserted in a bill to finance the Canadian
National Railways? It is a separate matter

and should be in a separate bill, and the
Canadian National Railway Company itself
snouid state why iL feedb this moncy.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: My honourable friend
will recall that the Trans-Canada Air Lines
is a wholly owned subsidiary of Canadian
National Railways, and one would assume
that financial requirements of the Canadian
National Railways under this bill would take
in the whole system, including the subsidiaries.
With regard to the Ethiopian in the woodpile, I can assure my honourable friend that
the Ethiopian has been there for at least a
year. This clause is exactly the same as it
appeared in last year's bill. As my honourable friend said, it provides that the Minister
of Finance may furnish an amount to meet
any deficit of Trans-Canada Airlines up to
June 30, 1954. So far it has not been necessary to make any advance, and I hope very
much that no advance will be necessary this
year.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I first want to rise in protest. They say an
opposition leader should always rise in protest, no matter how good or bad the legislation may be. I am not protesting about this
measure, but I am protesting against these
important bills coming before us within two

weeks of the end of the session. We have
been dealing here with the National Housing
Bill, a most important matter to Canada. On
the Order Paper before us we have the Radio
Bill, the Canadian National Railway Financing and Guarantee Bill and the Public
Service Superannuation Bill-one bill to
which this house should give very careful
attention. These are all matters of importance to Canada. Bills are continuing to come
before us, and many are not here yet. I do not,
and never did, think that the Senate can discharge its duties properly, when most of
the important legislation comes down within
the last two or three weeks of the session. It
seems to me that the dereliction of duty is
solely that of the government.
You may say that the opposition in the
House of Commons holds up government
business by long debates on the Speech from
the Throne and on the Budget. But the
Mother of Parliaments at Westminster has
been confronted with the same problem and
has solved it. For years it also was a problem in the House of Representatives at Washington, but it has been solved there too. Just
the other night a bill was sent over from the
British Commons to the House of Lords, and
it came back with seventy-eight amendments.
The opposition in the House of Commons
moved sixty-eight amendments more; but the

APRIL 30, 1953
Prime Minister brought in the guillotine, and
the bill passed.
Frankly, I could never see any good in
debates on the Speech from the Throne. I
say that after sixteen years' experience in the
legislature prior to my coming here. While
I was a member of the legislature I spoke
on every budget that was brought down there.
I had to go before the electors of Winnipeg,
and I considered my speeches good advertising, though I do not think they increased
the confidence of the people in me. Cannot
the same be said of members of the House of
Commons? I admit that every member of that
house should have a chance once a year to
lay before the parliament of Canada the
problems of his -part of the country and his
constituency, and what he deems proper for
parliament to consider. As you well know,
Mr. Acting Speaker, whenever there is a
motion to go into supply any member can get
up and make another speech. No protest
against the present system will be made in
the House of Commons, because every member there wants to be re-elected, but it is up
to us here to say that we do not think it is
of benefit to the people of Canada to make
all those speeches, and thereby delay consideration of important bills until the last
two or three weeks of the session. It seems
to me that the bills to which I have referred
are more important than anything else that
could be discussed.

statement for 1952 improperly reflected an
amount of $3 million taken into receipts, and
it failed to take into account the sum of $3j
million which the company was obligated to
pay for a retroactive wage increase. The
true result of the year's operations was a loss
of more than $6 million and not, as the statement shows, a profit of $142,000.
Parliament last year allowed the railway to
write off something like $1,250,000,000.
I
asked the President directly whether if that
amount were written off the railway could
balance its budget from that time on. He
replied, "With reasonable business conditions,
yes."
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is what he said.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am glad to hear my
honourable friend frorn Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) say that this bill will be referred
to committee. I doubt whether we shall have
the benefit of having the President with us,
but there are many questions to be asked,
particularly as to last year's statement. Technically speaking, the statement m'ay be quite
correct, but morally it is absolutely wrong
and cannot be justified. The press spread
across the country the fact that the C.N.R.
statement for 1952 showed a profit of $142,000.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: May I ask my honour,able friend a question with reference to the
retroactive wage increase? Is it not true that
the decision of the arbitrator did not come
out until after the end of the year?

visions of the Superannuation Act received it
in virtue of the statute: it was given to him
simply as a matter of grace, on a vote by the
G'overnor General in Council, who determined in each case what the pension should
be in recognition of good services rendered
by the individual. Under the present bill
a pension becomes a matter of right. It is
stated very clearly what pension a person
who is a contributor is entitled upon retirement to receive, so that the individual knows
exactly what his pension will be, and the
terms and conditions under which he will be
entitled to receive it; and as a matter of law
he can, if needs be, enforce his rights by
action.
This is one of the principal and very
important changes which this bill seeks to
bring about.
The next important change in principle is
to enable temporary employees, many of
whom have been in government services for
many years, to be included in the pension
plan. In the past the loose use in the act

SENATE
legislation temporary employees will have to
carry that burden themselves.
The contributions to be made by all those
who wish to participate in this pension scheme
amount to 6 per cent of the salary for males
and 5 per cent for females. These contributions must be made so long as the contributor
is employed, but not after he has, thirty-five
years of pensionable service to his credit.
On and after August 1, 1957, no further contributions will be made by anyone who has
attained his sixty-fifth birthday.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Does this provision as to
the 6 per cent and 5 per cent apply, no matter
what the salary of the employee is?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: It applies to the salary.
Hon. Mr. Reid: No, but no matter how
high or low the salary of the employee is,
does, this provision of 6 per cent or 5 per cent
apply?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Yes, except that no
person may contribute in respect of any
amount received as salary above $15,000.
There is a provision in the act which is
very important to all those participating in
the scheme. It provides that in future an
actuarial record or statement will be filed
with parliament to make certain that the
scheme is actuarily sound.
The government also makes a payment
equal to the sums paid in by the contributors
for current pensionable service, and in addition has agreed to allow interest on a 4 per
cent basis. It also stands behind the superannuation scheme, thereby guaranteeing its
solvency.
It may be of interest to know that a report
made by the Chief Auditor of the Department
of Insurance, tabled by the Minister of
Finance in parliament about a year ago,
revealed that the superannuation account was
inadequate to meet the full estimated liability
at that time. As a result, provision was made
for payment into this account of special
credits of $75 million in each of the fiscal
years 1950-51 and 1951-52; and a further sum
of $25 million in 1952-53. It was estimated
that as of March 31, 1953, there would still be
an actuarial shortage of approximately $189
million. Provision has been made to cover
that amount by credits, so that the fund will
be sufficient to meet the estimated liabilities.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: What would be the total
contributions made by the government?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: The government has

already paid $175 million, and $189 has to be
paid in, which is the estimated actuarial
shortage as of March 31, 1953. The fund was
inadequate to that extent.

Hon. Mr. Reid: Is it on a sound actuarial
basis now?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: It wili be whien these
sums are put in.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Nothing is being added;
it is just a matter of clearing up the debts.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: No. These sums which
have been calculated, and which are to be
deposited, will put the fund on a perfectly
sound actuarial basis, and this will be sufficient to meet the estimated liabilities.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Until the next time.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: The government stands
behind the fund, so that all liabilities will be
taken care of.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Can the honourable senator inform the house what annual contribution is made by the employees themselves?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: I am sorry, but I have
not got those figures. I endeavoured without
success to get them today, but they will be
available in committee.
Honourable senators, one important provision in the bill empowers the governor in
council to make regulations for the general
administration of the act, and particularly to
set the age at which a person shall retire
from the service. I would draw the attention
of honourable senators to section 30(1) (ad),
which reads as follows:
The governor in council may make regulations
notwithstanding any other act of the Parliament
of Canada, providing that, upon attaining such age
as is fixed by the regulations, a contributor shall
cease to be employed in the Public Service unless
his continued employment therein is authorized in
accordance with such regulations, and prescribing
the circumstances under which and the conditions
upon which he may continue to be employed in
the Public Service after he has attained that age.

In other words, there is no retirement age
provided in the legislation, and the governor

in council is given power to pass regulations
to fix the age of retirement and the conditions
of retirement for the contributor.

Hon. Mr. Reid: Would the governor in council pass judgment in each individual case?
What happens when a contributor reaches the
age of sixty-five and is desirous of continuing
his employment? Would his case have to be
dealt with by order in council?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: No. The act contemplates that regulations will be passed by the
governor in council to deal generally with the
conditions of retirement.
Hon. Mr. Reid: For how many years may
anyone work beyond the age of sixty-five?

Hon. Mr. Campbell: That will depend
entirely upon the regulations which may be
made by the governor in council. As I
pointed out, there is nothing in the act which

INTERNAL ECONOMY AND STAFF
OF THE SENATE
REPORTS OF COMMITTEE
CONCURRED IN

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth
and fourteenth reports of the Standing Committee on Internal Economy and Contingent
Accounts.
Hon. Felix P. Quinn moved concurrence in
the reports.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, I rise,
not to offer any comment upon the recommendations contained in these reports, but to
remark that I have noticed a growing tendency to curtail what few prerogatives and
powers remain to the House of Commons and
the Senate. Bit by bit we are coming under
civil service control, and an illustration of
this tendency is the recommendation in one
of these reports that, upon the recommendation of civil servants, a certain civil service

salary shall be increased. I do not know how
many honourable senators fully realize that
parliament is above the civil service, but I
would point out that if encroachments here
and there are not checked, we in this chamber
may end up by being ourselves no more than
civil servants. I have never raised any
objection to the deduction for income tax purposes of a part of my indemnity cheque, but
I have always doubted the legal right of the
treasury to do this. I reiterate that many
honourable senators seem not to realize where
we are drifting, and I want to draw their
attention to the fact, as indicated in these
reports, that it is a body of civil servants
that recommends this, that and the other
thing, and we merely accede to their reports.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I do not think the honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon.
Mr. Reid) fully understands the situation in
respect to the report of which he complains.
This report is a recommendation of the Internal Economy Committee of the Senate. It
contains certain proposals which were read
yesterday and are included in today's proceedings, but in fact the initiative in this case
comes from honourable members who are on
that committee. At an earlier stage some
suggestions with respect to the salary of one
official were made to the Civil Service Commission, and it replied in relation to that
salary with a certain proposal, which was
adopted. The initiative in this instance was
not that of the civil service or the Civil Service Commission, but of the Senate itself
through its representatives on the Internal
Economy Committee. That is the point I
want to make.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Can the honourable senator
explain why it is recommended, over the
signatures of Mr. Bland, Mr. Nelson and Mr.
Boudreau, "under section 59 of the Civil Service Act, that this class be exempt . . .", for

it is a member of this very class, on the staff
of the Senate, whose salary we are increasing.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: There are various classifications of employees of the Senate. Some
of these are wholly under the Civil Service
Commission, others come under the authority
of the Senate. The principal items in the
report on which recommendations are made
are such as the Internal Economy Committee
is, apart from any other consideration, perfectly competent to make. It is true that the
Treasury Board can withhold the necessary
funds. That is another matter. But so far
as the authority for the recommendations is
concerned, that rests definitely in the Internal
Economy Committee of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I have
a high regard for the honourable senator from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid), and also

SENATE
I wish to assist the acting leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Lambert) with some

reason for the action to which he has referred.
I entirely agree with the honourable senator

I attended

th:at we should cnntrnl the salaries of Senate

remarks by way of

the meeting of the committee, and therefore
I have some personal knowledge of the facts.
With one exception, all the matters contained
in the reports before us were exclusively dealt
with by the Internal Economy Committee;
and all the decisions recorded there were
made by them. No one else had anything to
do with it. There is only one recommendation
with which the Civil Service Commission had
anything to do, and this is the explanation.
The gentleman involved in that report serves
not only as Assistant to the Clerk of the
Parliaments, but as Chief Treasury Officer of
the Senate, under the Department of Finance,
and therefore is not wholly under our control;
but we desired that the work he does for the
Finance Department should be compensated
separately, and as only the Civil Service Commission has power to deal with a case of this
kind, its proposals were incorporated in the
committee's report and recommendations. I
have explained the circumstances so that the
honourable member may understand the

employees, but the main duties of the gentleman in question are performed on behalf of
the Department of Finance. The salary which
has been granted to this official for his
employment as Assistant to the Clerk of the
Parliaments is not what we asked for, but is
an improvement over what he has been
getting. I am sure that if the honourable
gentleman from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) were a member of that committee he

HOUSING BILL

G. Hawkins moved the second

reading of Bill 339, an Act to amend the
National Housing Act, 1944.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to effect certain amendments
to the National Housing Act.
Before proceeding to a detailed consideration of the amendments, it might be appropriate to review briefly the progress made in
respect of housing programs during the past
seven years. During this period starts in
Canada, excluding conversions of existing
buildings, totalled 570,000. The support of
the federal government in the field of housing
during this period was to a large extent
carried out under the National Housing Act.
During this period 141,249 dwelling units
were financed under joint loan terms of the
act. Another 30,000 were built on direct government account. This included 28,000 units
in the veterans' rental housing program, and
a further 1,760 under the public housing
section, section 35, of the National Housing
Act. A further 18,000 units were built under
the rental insurance plan. In addition to
these, Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation has built 12,000 permanent married
quarters for the armed services, as well as a
number of units for other government
departments, including the Department of
Defence Production. Housing assistance by
the federal government has also been forthcoming under the Veterans' Land Act, the
Canadian Farm Loan Act and the Farm
Improvement Loans Guarantee Act. The net
result is that two out of every five permanent
post-war houses in Canada have been built
with assistance of one kind or another from
the federal government.
Honourable senators are no doubt aware
that operations under the National Housing
Act may be broken down into three major
classifications:
(1) Housing financed jointly with the lending institutions;
(2) Housing constructed by means of financing on direct account; and
(3) Housing programs carried out jointly by
the federal government and various provinces
and municipalities.
It is readily appreciated that the major
portion of housing under the National Housing
Act is financed jointly with various lending
institutions. These lending companies include
life and fire insurance, trust and loan companies and fraternal societies. The importance
of the participation of these companies in
mortgage lending and financing of house construction cannot be over-emphasized. Their

commitments in the whole mortgage field in
1951 amounted to $434 million, and in 1952 to
$497 million, an increase ot là per cent. The
level of net mortgage investments by these
companies in 1952 absorbed one-half of the
total increase of assets during the year, and
their mortgage holdings at the end of the
year represented something more than onequarter of their total assets. In fact, since
1945 they have participated in lending under
the National Housing Act to the extent of
over $620 million.
By 1947 it became apparent that the government in addition to its joint lending would
have to make direct loans in those areas and
for certain projects where the lending institututions were not prepared to participate. At
that time section 31A was introduced to make
loans available to home owners in outlying
areas. In addition, direct loans were made to
finance rental insurance projects for which
institutional mortgage loans were not available. Direct loans have also been made for
defence workers' housing, and since last July
an arrangement has been entered into whereby the lending institutions may act as agents
of the corporation to make loans on direct
corporation account in centres of from 5,000
to 50,000 population. This was effected in
order to prevent certain centres from being
deprived of mortgage money and to facilitate
National Housing Act benefits to prospective
home owners in those areas. Up to the end
of 1952 loans had been approved under section 31A of the act in respect of 16,292
dwellings.
In considering the joint federal-provincial
operation to provide low rental housing, it
will be recalled that immediately following
the last war the chief supply of low rental
housing was achieved through the veterans'
housing program. This was carried out under
a scheme whereby a portion of the land and
services was provided by the municipality
and the construction by the federal government. By 1949 this program had come to an
end and section 35 of the act was enacted with
a view to meeting the most urgent problem
connected with housing, that is, the provision
of serviced land. The new section provided
for a joint participation in land assembly and
the construction of low rental housing projects to be participated in by federal and
provincial governments on a 75 per cent-25
per cent basis.
Under this program two operations have
been successfully carried out:
(1) Low rental housing developments have
been built, the ownership of which is vested
in the federal-provincial partnership, and a
local housing authority is set up to manage
the property. Care is taken to see that only

td $500 million. In other words, at the
present time the limited amount is $300 million, and it is planned to increase this amount
to $500 million.
The fifth amendment is in respect of rental
control under the Rental Insurance plan. As
the act presently stands, the amount of rent
which may be charged by a borrower in
respect of units financed under rental insurance is limited by agreement between the
corporation and the borrower. At present
the period of control is three years from the
date off "completion of the entire project".
This has meant a hardship to the borrower in
large housing developments where the cornpletion dates of various units may take place
over a period of years. The amendment contemplated here would permit a rent control
period to be on a unit basis or as the units
are completed.
The sixth amendment revises section 12 of
the National Housing Act, sometimes known
as the slum clearance section, which provides
for federal grants for municipalities in clearing, rehabilitating and replanning blighted
or substandard areas.
The new section contains two major
changes. First of all, the present section 12
authorizes the minister, with the approval
of the Governor in Council, to make a grant
to a municipality to assist it in acquiring and
clearing a slum area. A condition of such
grant at present is that the area to be
acquired and cleared must be sold to a limited
dividend housing company for the construction of a housing project under section 9 of
the act, or to a life insurance company for
the construction of a housing project under
section 11. Both sections 9 and 11 provide
for loans to companies intending to construct low and moderate rental houses. At
present the amount of the grant must not
exceed one-half of the difference between the
cost of the acquisition and clearance of the
land and the price at which it is sold to a
limited dividend company or a life insurance
company. The remainder of the excess costs
must be borne by the municipality or the
province aand the municipality jointly. The
amendment contained in this section makes
it possible to sell the land not only to a
limited dividend company, or a life insurance
company, but to a province and Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation jointly for a
housing development under section 35 of
the National Housing Act. The basis of
sharing the cost of acquisition and clearance
remains unchanged. The cost of development
under section 35 is borne by the province and
the federal government on a 75 per cent-25
per cent basis.

The second major change affects the present
requirement that the cleared area be redeveloped for housing puiposes. The noew amendment permits the new area to be used either
for housing purposes or municipal, provincial
or federal purposes, provided the municipality
makes available an alternative area for housing development of a size sufficiently large to
bouse the same number of persons who were
living in the cleared area.
The seventh amendment raises from $150
million to $250 million the statutory appropriation for loans for rental housing financed
under the act.
It is proposed to refer the bill to the Banking and Commerce Committee, and I recommend the legislation to honourable senators
for their earnest consideration and approval.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
do not intend to discuss the amendments to
the National Housing Act. I have a strange
feeling in my mind whenever amendments to
this act come before us. I hope I am just as
wrong as any man could possibly be, but I
am rather fearful of where this sort of thing
is going to end. I admit many people cannot
get living accommodation in this country, and
I know that this is a terrible situation. But
when I know of property that was considered
to be reasonably priced at $10,000 ten years
ago and is selling today for $20,000, I just
wonder where it will all end. Perhaps I am
wrong, and it may be that the fellow who
is paying $20,000 for a house which could have
been bought ten years ago for $10,000, is
right. Prices may never come down againone cannot tell-but history has a habit of
repeating itself. A United States committee
on real estate has carried on an exhaustive
investigation for 150 years. The managing
director of that organization delivered an
address in my city about three years ago, and
he related that records for the last 150 years
have shown that property values in the United
States have consistently reached their highest
mark and lowest mark in a cycle of 18 years
-the high-mark in the cycle has been reached
in 9 years, and then prices have begun to
drop and the low point has been reached in
the next 9 years, after which prices have
begun to rise again and the cycle has started
in once more.
However, I admit that there are two or three
factors that may cause a variation in that
cycle in Canada. One is immigration. A
great many people in Europe would like to
come to Canada to live. They think this
country has a great undeveloped area which
they and their families could help to develop.
They think, too, that Canada is removed-as
far as any part of the world can be removed
-from the immediate threat of war, or, worse

MAY 4, 1953
than that, the sudden attack of war without
notice. Another reason for their desiring to
come is that we are situated alongside a
wealthy neighbour which, militarily and
scientifically, is the most powerful nation in
the world. Now, these are strong inducements
to many people in Europe to emigrate to this
country, and it may be that for years to come
the same cycle that I have mentioned will
not operate in Canada; it may be a cycle of a
longer or a shorter period of years. But I
have never in my life known an instance.
where a government institution that has gone
into business has in the long run stood up
during tough times-I am not talking about
depression times-and grappled with the
situation as well as private concerns and
individuals could. It is true, I know, that in
this country the life insurance companies play
a big part; they are very ably managed and
do their best to protect policy holders.
When I look at some building that has been
done in late years, I wonder what is going
to happen to it. In my own city there are
square blocks, containing four or eight apartments, with no decoration, each building
looking just like a box, and in a part of the
city where nobody would live if they could
find accommodation in any other part. Under
present conditions those properties can be
rented, it is true; but the government guarantees the net rental to be so much, and that is
the feature that I am afraid of. In my city, and
in other cities too, I see properties being built
that will be the very firist to become unoccupied as soon as there is a slowing down
in the demand for housing. I am aware of
the present demand. I realize that a house
that ten years ago cost $10,000 to build costs
$20,000 today, but unless wages go up proportionately through these years of peace-and
so far they have not--certain types of people
can never hope to own a house. Of course, if
it is going to be the policy of the government
and of the provinces and municipalities concerned to pay the difference, well and good.
However, it is the taxpayers who will have
to pay it.
Hon. Mr. King: It has been the policy of
parliament.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, not to furnish free
rentals-not yet. If that policy is adopted the
federal government will want the provinces
and the municipalities to come in. Free housing has never yet been provided, even for
the veterans. With the present cost of housing,
certain classes of our population cannot possibly contribute the proportion of their
income that is required, which is maybe 20
to 25 per cent. None of this legislation has
ever attempted to solve that problem. There
was some talk about setting aside certain
68112-37

land in my city, the dominion government
to pay 75 per cent, and the province to pay
25 per cent. The province refused to comply;
it offered to contribute 12j per cent, and the
city refused to pay the other 124 per cent,
and the thing bogged down. I am not speaking with respect to the veterans, I am speaking of ordinary rentals. In many instances
in Winnipeg when houses were rented, the
great trouble was that they were rented to
people who should not have been in them at
all, and now it is difficult to get them out.
Now in Ottawa, they are trying to raise the
rents of houses for the veterans, to take care
of the increase in taxes. There is a similar
problem in Winnipeg right now. People are
saying, "Why should we pay taxes for some
people to have houses below their economic
value, or even at the cost value of the buildings?" That is a pretty hard question to
answer.
I do not know whether or not I read the
papers correctly, but I think that trade is not
quite as active now as it was some time
ago. I am not introducing another subject.
The point I am trying to make is the cost of
housing has got to be borne by the public
generally, if the people who are seeking a
place to live cannot pay it. But I am persuaded that the day may come when the
housing scheme will back up a little on us.
And there is nothing that can collapse so
quickly as housing values and rental values.
In the depression years I saw house after
house rented for $16 per month which today
are rented at $75 and $100.
I raise this question not to oppose the bill.
I am glad the honourable gentleman is going
to move to have it 'sent to committee, where
we shall get a further explanation.
Mine may be a voice crying in the wilderness. I honestly hope that generations following after will not run into difficulties resulting
from housing schemes. But I am afraid that
if they do they will say, "Why didn't those
fellows back in the fifties call attention to
what might develop from the housing
situation?"
For these reasons I have always been a
little apprebensive of measures such as the
one now before us.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Honourable senators,
may I ask the sponsor of the bill if he has
information as to the number of housing units
built last year under the auspices of the
Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation?

like this question to be answered in committee: Is there really a cash fund or just a
paper entry? The view is taken by many in
parliament, among the public and in the civil
service itself, that each year the government incurs a deficit of several million
dollars to keep this fund solvent. But after
studying this bill and reading the various
reports which have been placed before the
government, I believe that this amount of
$189 million is only an estimate made by an
actuary of what he thinks might be required
if the whole government system collapsed.
This, of course, is a preposterous idea.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask the honourable
gentleman a question? Does the deficit not
result from the fact that the actuary bases
his estimate on the life expectancy of civil
servants?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I shall reply to my honourable friend by asking him a question. I take
it that the deficits vary from year to year,
but last year it amounted to only $1,425,000.
At the same time some $15,352,000 was paid
out of the fund to persons drawing superannuation, and '$13,927,000 was contributed
by civil servants. I again ask the question:
Why is there any need for this amount of
$189 million?

Hon. Mr. Haig: I shall give my honourable
friend an illustration when I take part in
the debate.
Hon. Mr. Davis: May I interrupt my honourable friend to ask a question? Is it not
true that if the money is being extracted
from the pay cheques of civil servants it
must be in the fund somewhere? My honourable friend says it is just on paper.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I said that the $189 million
which is being asked for is a paper or bookkeeping entry. Some actuary merely says
"We should have these amounts on the books
to keep the fund solvent." That is why I

mates which were passed by parliament
include this amount of $189 million? If that
is so, then naturally the amount would be
shown as having been paid out and as being
charged to the country.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I do not think so. The $189
million is the latest figure from the government itself. The Minister of Finance, in
explaining the bill in the other house, said

that it would take $189 million to clean the
matter up. That is the way he put it.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: There is a further amount
in the estimates this year.
Hon. Mr. Haig: There is every year.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Yes. And does that amount
not have to be paid out from the superannuation fund?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Well, I do not think it is
actually paid at all; it is merely drawn from
one account to another. There is no actual

payment. I do not believe they really have
that cash in hand, nor do I believe they
require it. It is different from the operation
of the Unemployment Insurance Act, under
which a fund is set up and is invested. That
is not the case here. If the deficit last year
was only $1,425,000, why is $189 million
needed to clean it up? That is just one of
the many features of this legislation which
has puzzled me.
One particular criticism I have of this bill
is that employees in the lower salary brackets
are going to be called upon to contribute
more towards their superannuation. At the
present time those earning up to $1,200 a
year are only requijed to contribute 5 per
cent of their income, but if and when this
legislation becomes law they will be required
to pay 6 per cent. Furthermore, those earning between $1,200 and $1,500 will be required
to contribute 6 per cent, whereas at the present time they .contribute only 51 per cent; and
the present requirement of 6 per cent contribution by those earning over $1,500 will
be unchanged. I think this aspect of the
legislation should be gone into thoroughly in
committee.
I would object to civil servants who earn
$20,000 a year or more being allowed to draw
a pension based on a salary of $15,000. We
must bear in mind that if the statement
made by the minister is correct-and I assume
it is-a man receiving $15,000 a year would
contribute $900 a year to his pension and
the government would match that contribution with a similar amount. It is my opinion
that persons receiving $20,000 a year from
the Civil Service should go and get insurance elsewhere and not ask the citizens of

MAY 4 1953
this country to put up $900 a year to help
protect them by a pension based on the
$15,000 salary limit. Honourable senators
are aware, of course, that a civil servant
cannot receive a pension based on a salary
over $15,000.
I would like to make just a few comments on
the high salaries we are paying some of our
civil servants. Honourable senators tonight
gave second reading to Bill 339, an Act to
amend the National Housing Act, 1944. I am
not going to criticize the President of the
Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation,
but at $20,000 he is one of our highest paid
officials in the Civil Service. He gets more
than our cabinet ministers or even our Prime
Minister. When I was a plant manager I
never had a workman under me who received
a higher salary than I did. I think that is
a general principle in business and in industry.
The Prime Minister and his cabinet are responsible to the people of Canada for the annual
spending of some $5 billion or more, and
yet we find some civil servants drawing a
higher salary than they do. As I said before,
a civil servant earning $20,000 can contribute
$900 a year to his pension and the government
will match that amount. Based on an annual
salary of $15,000 this will give him a pension
of $6,000 after twenty years. And there are
many others who will draw pensions on the
basis of a salary of $15,000.
I am not going to say a great deal about the
high salaries, although I could; but I do object
to some departments of government refusing
to say what their employees are receiving. I
think it is a dangerous state of affairs when
they can defy parliament and not tell what
some employees are being paid. Perhaps
we have been spoiled by the salaries paid by
the United Nations. Canada has never to
my knowledge protested against the high
and steadily rising salaries of United Nations
officials, to which the Canadian taxpayers contribute. And yet we wonder how taxes can
be cut down. I do not believe much attention
will be paid to my protest; but listen to what
Dorothy Thompson says about United Nations
salaries:
U.N. salaries are scaled to normal home salaries
plus a per diem alowance ranging from $10 to $20
per day. The recipients have cars at their disposai, pay no income tax, get cigarettes, liquor,
etc., free of customs and way below home prices.
The theory is that otherwise no one would serve.
And I agree with her, when she adds "This
is nonsense." It is just utter nonsense that no
one would serve. We have never heard a
voice in protest against these high salaries,
which Canadians are helping to pay. Some
U.N. officials are having their superannuation
held in abeyance until they come back to

Canada from leave of absence; their superannuation will be held in statu quo until they
return.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Are we paying any superannuation to United Nations employees?
Hon. Mr. Reid: No. My honourable friend
could not have heard what I said. The superannuation credit of these men who are on
leave of absence from the Civil Service rests
until they leave their United Nations positions and return here. Of course, those who
definitely severed their connections with the
Civil Service are on their own and no longer
have any superannuation credit. But the
money paid into the fund by those who have
gone on leave is held for them, and they can
start in contributing again when they return,
and later collect.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Will my honourable
friend tell me what the basis of superannuation is, what the formula is?
Hon. Mr. Reid: What do you mean by the
formula?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: On what basis is the
pension for a retired employee worked out?
Hon. Mr. Reid: My honourable friend will
have to get that information in committeie.
It is an important question.
Now I want to raise another matter, which
I mentioned the other evening and about
which the acting leader of the government
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) said I was wrong. It
will be remembered that when the reports
of the Internal Economy Committee were
being considered, I got up and immediately
protested against the Senate's losing control
over its employees. The acting leader of the
government endeavoured, as I suppose was
his right, to correct me. But I wonder if any
honourable senators noticed what certain
sections in the present bill will do to the
right or powers of the Senate and the House
of Commons. This to me is very distressing
indeed. Paragraph (j) of clause 2 defines
"Public Service" in this way:
(j) "Public Service" means the several positions

Compare that with what section 2(c) of

which I will continue to speak until something
is done. It has long been my thought that
the leaders of labour and civil servants in
this country have led the workers and
employees in the wrong direction by advocating retirement at sixty-five years of age.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I believe that when you
force men or women to retire at sixty-five
years, without an occupation of some kind to
turn to, you pronounce on them the death
sentence. Insurance companies tell me that
the average length of life of people who are
superannuated with nothing to do is three and
a half years.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask the honourable senator if he has found any reference to
retirement at the age of sixty-five years in
this legislation?
Hon. Mr. Reid: The bill contains a hint that
it may be raised to sixty-eight years of age.
I was about to commend that extension to the
house.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I think if my honourable
friend reads the bill closely he will find that
no retiring age is specified, but that it is left
to the Governor in Council to determine what
the age shall be.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I do not think there is such
a provision in the Civil Service Act.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: It is in the bill before us.
Hon. Mr. Reid: When the bill is before the
committee I may have 'an opportunity to
check on it.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: My point is that the bill
now before us contains no reference to sixtyfive years as the retirement age. I mention
that fact because of what the honourable
senator has said about bringing up the
question.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: But the remarks are in
order.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Quite in order.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I realize it might be impracticable to allow employees to stay in employment as long as they might want to, but the
government should make a straightforward
statement as to the retirement regulations and
raise the age for compulsory retirement. As
a matter of fact, the hiring and retirement of
civil servants does not come under the act
now being considered, but under the Civil
Service Act. What the acting leader has had
to say with respect to retirement has no bearing on the provisions of the Civil Service Act.
As honourable senators know, there have
been instances of employees being retained
beyond the regular retirement age; but it is

not the policy of the government to allow all
employees to stay beyond the age of sixtyfive.
In this respect I should like to read to
honourable senators a short extract from an
article headed "The Problem of the Older
Worker", which appeared in the April issue
of the Canadian Unionist. I quote:
In 1881, the number of Canadians over 40 constituted 20 per cent of the population; by 1951, this
had increased to approximately 32 per cent. When
we consider this trend in relation to the fact that
one of the chief difficulties facing the National
Employment Service in matching unplaced applicants with unfilled jobs is the tendency on the part
of employers to reject applicants over 40 (over
35 for women). one major aspect of a serious problem is exposed.

Here may I interject that it is hard to understand why, when women are healthier and
live longer than men, there should be a lower
minimum hiring age for women.
The article continues:
...
In 1881, there were 15 adults under 65 to every
one over 65. Today, there are only seven adults
under 65 to every one over 65. By 1971, it Is
estimated that there will be only five to one. When
we consider the effect of the trend towards more
pension plans with compulsory retirement rules,
now normally set at 65, another major aspect of
this problem is seen. From the point of view of
the national economy, the question arises whether
or not it is economically possible to maintain a
high standard of living In the face of trends which
see increasing numbers of older people rejected or
withdrawing from the productive section of society,
reducing their ability to consume goods and services (at the other end of the age scale more are
remaining at school longer), while the burden of
production, taxation (part of which must be for
old age assistance), etc., must be borne by a
decreasing percentage of the population, a trend
not likely to diminish.

Then I was rather interested in an article
by Dr. F. B. Bowman. He writes:
Certainly, efficiency does not suffer when men
of sixty-five years are employed. It bas been proved
that absenteeism is lower between the ages of
sixty and seventy-five than between the ages of
twenty or forty. In 1900, 4 per cent of the population reached the age of 65, in 1952 over 8 per
cent reached it, and the number is rapidly growing.

I will quote one more sentence from this
article:
Some day, perhaps the stupidity of evaluating
a man's ability on the number of his birthdays will
be realized. Particularly does tbis apply to the
professional cultural groups.

I was rather pleased to see that, at long
last, organized labour has taken a stand in
this matter. For some reason or other, in
the earlier years it was unwilling to do so.
I have here an article by A. R. Mosher,
President of the Canadian Congress of
Labour. Having reached the age of seventy
or over, he has begun to see things in a
different light from what he did when he
was forty or forty-five. He, with some others,
must accept a degree of responsibility for

SENATE
having led labour up the wrong channel in
connection with this matter of retirement.
It is my impression that many civil servants in Ottawa are opposed to civil servants
being retained beyond the age of sixty-five;
and this, for one reason. The average civil
servant is thinking about the effect of retirement upon promotions. May I point out to
those who think in this way that no more
false doctrine has been preached, no doctrine
whose acceptance brings death more quickly
to those those who are misled by it, provided
they are in good health mentally and bodily,
than that retirement at sixty-five should be
compulsory.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: Did not the civil
servants ask to be retired at sixty-five?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Not so far as I know. I
believe that is a mistaken idea which has
grown up. I do not think the service as such
has demanded retirement at sixty-five.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: I thought they did,
years ago.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Finally, a brief quotation
from an editorial:
Had they stopped work at 65, neither St. Laurent
nor Churchill could ever have led their countries.
Smuts and King would have been out of World
War IL and Eisenhower would now have but two
years to go ...
Today's man of 70 is no rare specimen to be
hung up in the closet with the worn-out shoes and
the 1890 bathing suit.

I am not going to read it all, but it is a
very good article, and it shows that the
usefulness os a man or a wuian duesuut
depend solely on his or ber age. We know
there are men and women who are old at
forty, and others who are young at seventyfive. This parliament is being led by a Prime
Minister who is very active and virile, of
great strength of mind and body, but who
would already have been retired had he been
employed in the Civil Service.
I make no apologies, honourable senators,
for again bringing this matter of retirement
age to your attention. I feel keenly about it.
I have spoken on it openly, on platforms and
in private, and in parliament. I trust the
government will show some leadership, in
the spirit of the article I have just read,
recognizing the smallness of the gap available for productive labour between the group
that is now being kept longer at school and
the group of useful men and women who
are retired at sixty-five. The available
working force may soon be too small to bear
the financial burden in Canada of the welfare
state.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: Honourable senators, I
move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at

THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Honourable senators, I
move the third reading now.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Honourable senators, while
I have no objection to the bill receiving third
reading today, I should like to renew the
question I asked of the sponsor (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) last Thursday as to the economic
effect of dieselization on the Maritime provinces.
I recall that when Mr. Donald Gordon,
President of the Canadian National Railways,
was before the committee of the other house
he made the statement that a number of
selected runs by diesel locomotives had shown
a saving of, I believe, $2,685,000. A statement was made before our Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce today to the
effect that on Prince Edward Island there
had been a saving of $235,000.
My question is whether the railway system
has made an estimate of the total savings
likely to result from a changeover from the
use of coal to the use of oil during the fiveyear period in which the changeover would
take place.
I would remind honourable senators that we
were informed that in 1951 some 280 steam
locomotives were converted to the use of oil,
and another 115 were changed over last year,
making a total of 395 for the two-year period;
and that the full changeover program would
be completed by 1956.
We in the Maritime provinces are particularly interested in the effect of the conversion
from coal to oil on our part of the country.
When I have an answer as to the estimated
savings by reason of the changeover, I shall
perhaps have a further question to ask.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
that point was discussed in the house last
Thursday afternoon and was again raised in
the committee this morning; and the question
which my honourable friend has now asked
was asked of a Vice-President of the Canadian National Railways, who appeared as a
witness before the committee. He informed
us that the Canadian National Railways had
made no estimate of the total savings which
may be expected to result from the complete
dieselization of the road. In fact, he indicated
that at the present time it is impossible for
them to make any such estimate. He did
say that savings in the particular regions in
which total dieselization has been brought into
operation-that is, Prince Edward Island, the
Gaspé line, and one or two others-average

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I do not know if there

from dieselization of the whole railway system. I did notice from the evidence which
the President of the company gave before

except for special lines, such as the Gaspé
line and the Prince Edward Island line, the
company is adopting the policy of dieselizing
those services throughout the system where
the best prospects of effecting savings are
offered. For instance, he testified that the
company could anticipate immediate savings
in dieselizing the long-distance freight service, and that it could see immediate and
important savings in dieselizing the shunting operations in its yards; and therefore,
except for the special lines mentioned, it is
confining its dieselizing process to longdistance freight trains and to yard operations,
leaving the dieselization of the passenger
services, where the savings are not quite
so apparent, for a later date.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: My question is really whether the savings to which you refer will be
reflected in decreased freight rates to and
from the Maritime provinces.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I am afraid that is a
question that I am totally unable to answer
for my honourable friend. I would say to
him, however, that, as he appreciates, the
capital cost of dieselization runs into hundreds of millions of dollars; and I should
think that the proper thing to do would be to
pay off some of that capital cost before there
was any question of decreasing freight rates.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Thank you.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
PUBLIC SERVICE SUPERANNUATION
BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Campbell for the second reading of Bill 334,
an Act to provide for the superannuation of
persons employed in the Public Service of
Canada.
Hon. Arthur Marcotte: Honourable senators,
my remarks will be very brief indeed. Indeed,

08112-381

were it not for the fact that I could not
clearly hear all that the honourable senator
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) was
saying last night I would not have adjourned
the debate. Now that I have read his speech
I want to offer him my warmest compliments.
He is the first honourable senator who during my membership here has gone to so
much trouble and done so much research to
prepare himself for a discussion on superannuation. He obviously spent a great deal
of time in the careful study of statistical and
actuarial reports. I am very glad indeed
that he covered some of the points I intend
to discuss. No purpose would be served by
repeating what has already been said, but
I want to emphasize in just a few words
what he said about the powers that this
bill would take away from the Senate and
the House of Commons.
In presenting the bill the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell) said it
was a very involved and complicated piece
of legislation. In fact, it is. It would take
weeks of work for anyone to go into the
measure and find out exactly what its purposes are and what it is intended to accomplish. Unfortunately, we have not that much
time left this session. As the honourable
senator said yesterday, and I repeat, this is
not the first time that the Senate has complained because of important legislation coming over here at almost the last hour, when
there is no time to give it the attention it
should receive. The honourable senator from
Toronto said also that he would attempt
to deal very briefly in principle with changes
proposed by the bill, but curiously enough
the most important change was not touched
upon by him at all. I refer to the change
which would have the effect of taking away
certain privileges now enjoyed by the Senate

and the House of Commons. Now is the
time to consider the proposed change, while
it is in our minds.
Paragraph (j) of clause 2 of the bill reads:
"Public Service" means the several positions in
or under any department or portion of the executive government of Canada, and, for the purposes
of this act, of the Senate and the House of Commons of Canada, the Library of Parliament and
any board, commission, corporation or portion of

of
Canada specified

the Public
schedule A.

Section 2(c) of the present act defines "Civil
Service" in practically the same terms, down
to the words "the Senate, House of Commons
and Library of Parliament", but then there
is this saving clause:
but saving all rights and privileges of either house
in respect to the control or removal of its officers,
clerks and employees.

Both houses have been enjoying these rights
and privileges at all times since Confedera-

tion. Some attempts have been made to do
away with them, but the attempts have never
succeeded. And, hunouablie SenÎatGrS, I hopc
that we shall not conclude this session without making sure of retaining what is really
something very dear to us. These traditional
rights and privileges, of which the bill would
deprive us, affect every one of us, affect this
body as a whole. Yet unfortunately only
about half of our members are here today.
Is it fair to have the bill dealt with in these
circumstances? I do not think it is; and I
am quite sure that if our absent colleagues
were present they would join with the honourable member who spoke yesterday and with
me in our attempt to retain possession of
our cherished rights and privileges.
It bas been said that if this proposed new
act be passed the governor in council will
determine the age of retirement for all civil
servants. But do you think, honourable
senators, that the cabinet would take the
trouble to look into every one of a hundred
thousand cases? No; it would deal with only
a few cases, possibly of people that it would
not like to see touched by the regulations.
I do not intend to go any further in the
matter, for the bill is going to committee,
and we shall have a chance to discuss it
there. Perhaps the Standing Committee on
Civil Service Administration is the appropriate
committee. However, it bas not been given
a chance to meet very often, and I do not
know if there would be time to convene it
for consideration of this bill. In any event,
I understand the proposal is that the bill be
referred to the Banking and Commerce Committee. It will receive further consideration
there; but I repeat my complaint that we
are not being allowed anything like enough
time for the study of this important and
complicated measure.
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators,
I agree with the remarks made by the honourable senator from Ponteix (Hon. Mr.
Marcotte).
The effect of this proposed measure is to
deprive parliament of privileges it now
enjoys as to matters affecting its staff. Paragraph (j) of section 2 defines the words
"Public Service" in this way:
"Public Service" means the several positions in
or under any department or portion of the executive government of Canada, and, for the purposes
of this Act, of the Senate and House of Commons
of Canada, the Library of Parliament and any
board, commission, etc.,

As honourable senators know, the present
act excludes from the general regulations
the staffs of the Senate, the House of Commons and the Library of Parliament.
Because of that, a member of any one of

these staffs, whom it is desirable to retain
beyond the regular retirement age can be
The second feature of the bill to which
I wish to call the attention of the house is
covered by paragraph (ad) of section 30 (1),
which reads as follows:
The governor in council may make regulations
notwithstanding any other act of the Parliament of
Canada, providing that, upon attaining such age as
is fixed by the regulations, a contributor shall
cease to be employed in the Public Service unless
his continued employment therein is authorized in
accordance with such regulations, and prescribing
the circumstances under which and the conditions
upon which he may continue to be employed in the
Public Service after he bas attained that age.

Honourable senators will readily note that
although the regulations are to be made
by order in council they will have to do with
the classification of employees by categories;
thus, the regulations will have a general and
not a specific application. The retention of a
certain employee beyond the prescribed age
limit is a specific, not a general, question.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Vien: For example, the Prime
Minister of England, who today is 78 years
of age, is considered to be compos mentis,
alert, and quite capable of discharging the
duties of his high office; as is also the Prime
Minister of Canada, who has passed the age
of 70. How can it be determined by general
regulations whether it is in the public interest
to retain the services of an official

who has

reached a fixed age, whether it be 65 or 70?
This rather hazy legislation, which bas
obviously been drawn up by a bureaucratic
institution, takes from the governor in
council the power to deal with a particular
individual except by changing the general
regulations. For after the governor in council
bas made the regulations, then, according to
the paragraph I just read:
. . . upon attaining such age as is fixed by the
regulations, a contributor shall cease to be employed
in the Public Service unless his continued employment therein is authorized in accordance with such
regulations . . .

I say that principle is wrong; it ignores the
fundamental

discretion of the

.governor in

council with respect to exceptional cases.
Therefore, if for no other reason than
these points which I have raised-first, that
we should retain the prerogative of parliament to control its staff; and second, that

the regulations should have specific, not
general, application-this bill should receive
most careful study, and departmental officials
should be called upon to justify these proposed changes which seem to me unwarranted.

MAY 5, 1953
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask the honourable
gentleman a question before he sits down?
Am I to understand that in his opinion passage of this bill would mean that the officials
of the Senate and of the House of Commons
would be controlled by order in council?
Hon. Mr. Vien: No. I have been speaking
with respect to superannuation.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The control is only over
retirement.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Under the act in its revised
form the governor in council would pass
general regulations. The higher officials of
the Senate and the House of Commonsother employees are under the Civil Service
Commission-could no longer be retained
at the discretion of parliament; they would
have to be superannuated at the age of sixtyfive years unless under the general regulations their tenure of office was continued. By
virtue of these regulations the governor in
council may pass an order in council to
extend their employment year by year until
the age-if I mistake not-of seventy. So
unless the general regulations otherwise provide, instead of the Senate and the House of
Commons decreeing the continuance in office
of such employees, it will be done by the
governor in council. Of course, the governor
in council can at any time change the regulations; but they will be applicable to all cases
instead of to any one in particular.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What the senator from De
Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien) has just said is,
to me, rather startling. As the law stands,
if the government decides to continue in its
employ any person whom, for special reasons,
it desires to retain, it can do so under order
in council. But, as I understand my honourable friend, if the present-bill should become
law that will be no longer possible. Supposing it is desired to hold in the service some
particularly capable individual who has
passed the normal retirement age, what
follows? If he is so continued, will all other
employees within that classification also
become eligible for continuation in office?
Hon. Mr. Vien: Under the general regulations there will be certain provisions to continue certain people in office, but the general regulations will provide the conditions
under which their continued employment
may be authorized.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Let us suppose that it is
desired to keep in the service some high
executive in the Department of National
Revenue: how can that be done without
necessarily placing others in the position of
being exempted from retirement?

Hon. Mr. Vien: I speak subject to correction, but my understanding is that at the
present time the governor in council may
by order in council grant an extension of
time to any civil servant.
Hon. Mr. Euler: How is that to be changed
by the bill?
Hon. Mr. Vien: By section 30, subsection (1),
paragraph (ad), which reads as follows:
The governor in council may make regulations
notwithstanding any other act of the Parliament
of Canada, providing that, upon attaining such
age as is fixed by the regulations, a contributor
shall cesse to be employed in the Public Service
unless his continued employment therein is authorized in accordance with such regulations ...

Hon. Mr. Euler: Probably in this matter
I am rather stupid, but I wish my friend
would tell me thisHon. Mr. Vien: I have told the honourable
memberHon. Mr. Euler: One moment, please.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I want to protest against
the suggestion that I imply stupidity on the
part of the honourable gentleman: I said from
the very beginning that the wording of this
subsection is extremely nebulous.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Probably that is so. But,
pursuing the supposition I made a moment
ago: we want to keep in the service a certain
official, and the governor in council decides
to do so. What follows if this bill becomes
law? As the law stands, if the government
decides by order in council to keep an individual in office beyond the ordinary term it
may do so. Will it be otherwise under the
new law?
Hon. Mr. Vien: It is exactly as I stated.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I as an amateur
attempt to throw some light on my honourable
friend's question. The point which needs to be
cleared up is with reference to the provision
of the present act that the age of retirement
shall be sixty-five. We ail know that there
have been innumerable exceptions to this
provision, and that in face of the law extensions have been made to the age of sixtyseven or sixty-eight. I think it is only fair
to assume that the present bill was drafted
from a desire to have the law applied according to its letter, and not by order in council
to make exceptions to it. The omission of
any specific age of retirement from the new
act will make it possible for the governor
in council to enforce the law according to the
exact requirements of the act. I think that
is all there is to it.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Oh, that is not all there is
to it.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I am speaking of the
meanings which have been read into this
part of the enactment. I think this part deals
entirely with the age of retirement. I do not
believe there is any intention whatsoever to
interfere with the internal economy administration of this house or the other. Should
the question of the retirement of some
employee of this house arise, there seems no
doubt that, if circumstances justified it, the
governor in council could retire the individual
before the age of sixty-five, but not-anyway,
in my opinion-without a recommendation
from our Committee on Internal Economy.
Hon. Salier A. Hayden: Honourable senators, in my view this is a rather important
bit of legislation, and an improvement on the
present law. I think the sum-total effect of
the bill is to establish a tidier and more
up-to-date superannuation plan, and machinery for the administration of the plan, than
there is under the present Superannuation Act.
As I sat here listening, I was rather interested
to notice that the discussion swung around to
whether the Senate is to be deprived of some
right to deal with certain of its employees
in the matter of retirement, and to the question of compulsory retirement at the age of
sixty-five, under the act, and the absence of
a provision for this in the bill. I shall have
something to say on that in a moment, but
first I would like to point out some of the
changes and benefits contained in the bill,
and then come to what I regard as the real,
human considerations to which we should give
our attention. We talk in general terms about
superannuation, but superannuation has to do
with persons, individuals, human beings; and
it is for us to see what will be the result of
the application of this bill as and when it
becomes law, and, particularly, how it will
affect the majority of our civil servants. Do
not let us translate it in terms of what it
gives to those who are in the higher income
brackets of the Civil Service. That is not a
fair test, because these people represent a
minority, and at times they have ways of
being more vocal than those in lower income
levels.
Honourable senators, this legislation is beneficial in that it creates a right to superannuation, whereas the present law provides only
that the governor in council may authorize;
in other words, at the present time the
authority is merely permissive.
Under the present act an employee arrives
at the amount of his superannuation by basing
it on the last ten years of his service. That
provision has been changed to the best ten
years. I would warn honourable senators not
to be fooled by this change. It is true that the
amendment represents an improvement and

should have been made. The real benefit that
would accrue from this chanee miebt take
place if a civil servant, at some stage during
his working years, were demoted with a consequent decrease in salary; or, if there was a
recession as a result of which you had a general percentagewise lowering of salaries.
That is not fanciful or far-fetched, for it
actually occurred some time during the period
from 1930 to 1935. Selecting the best ten
years of an employee's service will mean an
advantage to some employees who heretofore
have had to come under the rigid rule now
existing in the law.
Additional persons are brought under the
superannuation plan, and there is an increase
in benefits to a widow and children. At the
present time the combined drawing that can
be made by widows and children under sixteen cannot exceed 75 per cent of the pension,
but under the bill this has been increased to
90 per cent.
Another feature of the bill is that the government specifically provides that it will
match the contributions made by the civil
servants. I have searched the present act, and
I have been informed that it contains no statutory provision to this effect.
I understand that government contributions
in the past were not made regularly over
the years to match the employees' contributions. This failure 'or oversight is being corrected through contributions which the
government will provide.
Honourable senators, let us go to the other
side of the question. I am advised that the
average salary throughout the entire Civil
Service ranges between $2,400 and $2,600 a
year, and if this amendment goes through a
civil servant will be entitled to 2 per cent 'of
his average salary over his best ten years.
In order to arrive at the maximum benefit
under the superannuation plan the civil servant must have worked the full period of
thirty-five years. In this event he would
qualify for 70 per cent of the average of his
best ten years. The average employee's
pension is computed on the basis of 70 per
cent of $2,400 to $2,600, which amounts to
$1,600 or $1,700 a year. That is the optimum;
the percentage would be reduced for those
who come into the Civil Service late in life
or who retire earlier for some reason or
another and have not put in thirty-five years
of service. Employees with thirty years of
service would get 60 per cent of the average
of their best ten years. The application of
70 per cent on thirty-five years' service to
those in higher brackets-who are fewer in
number-produces an income which in certain circumstances would enable a person to
get along reasonably well at the time of life

MAY 5, 1953
when he retires. On the other hand, applying 70 per cent on thirty-five years' service
to those in the lower brackets, who are
more numerous, produces an amount of not
more than $1,600 or $1,700. This brings one
to the realization that in -the event of the
sudden demise of a retired civil servant, his
widow would be entitled to only 50 per cent
of his pension. In my opinion this is one
eventuality of the legislation to which we
should address ourselves. It is unlikely that
we can do anything about it at this stage
of the session, and for ail I know the government may plan to make some special
contribution. I have not the ability to calculate whether a change in the number of
years of service would call for additional
contributions by the government to keep the
fund actuarially sound, but I think we should
consider thoroughly this aspect of the legislation. While I am not indifferent to those
civil servants belonging to the higher income
brackets, I am more concerned about those
in the lower brackets. These people constitute the great majority of civil servants
and who forn the basis of the working force
in the day-to-day operations of the government. We should study this plan from the
point of view of what the majority of
employees stand to benefit from it. I understand that when this legislation was being
considered the suggestion was made that
the pension should be based on the best five
years rather than the best ten years. A fiveyear provision might be drawing too fine a
bead, but some percentage between five and
ten might be adopted which would produce
a higher level of pension for the average
civil servant. It must be remembered that,
even if the period of service were reduced
to thirty years and the pension were based
on the best eight years, the number of those
who would qualify for the maximum benefit
would niot be great.
Honourable senators, there is no person
more jealous of the rights of the Senate than
I am. While I would fight strenuously to
maintain the position of this chamber at all
times, I am more concerned just now to see
that the true objective of the superannuation plan is reached. Within reason, the
greatest benefit should be given to the
greatest number of employees-those in the
lower income brackets. Their superannuation benefit on retirement will be substantially less than the arnount they earn while
working, and their capacity when on retirement to do anything else which would produce income will be substantially less than
that of persons with professional qualifications, who were in the higher brackets while
in the Civil Service.

My opinion is that this bill in two important particulars requires some study by us,
and some comment; first, as to whether or
not the best ten years is properly the part
of the term of service that should be used
in the formula for the purpose of averaging,
or whether it should not be something less
than ten years; and secondly, as to whether
or not 35 years should be the maximum
period of working years on which the superannuation may be computed. At present the
formula is 2 per cent per annum for every
year of service up to a maximum of 35 years
-that is, a maximum of 70 per cent-which
is applied to the employee's average salary
for the past ten years. Now, should the
maximum period for computation be reduced,
say to thirty years, and the annual percentage stepped up to a 2j per cent basis?
I think those are the phases of this bill on
which we should concentrate our attention.
The other parts of it are tacked on as
requirements that are necessary in order to
give a plan that will be fully operative under
all conditions. The purpose of a superannuation plan, in any event, is to provide a
decent amount of superannuation for the
majority of people who are in the plan.
Therefore, we should consider whether this
Public Service superannuation plan does that
or not, and, if it does not, what could be
done within reason to bring that situation
about as soon as possible.
There has been some discussion about the
change from the present compulsory retirement age of 65. That is the provision in
the present law. But in many instances the
governor in council, on satisfying the conditions that are contained in the present law,
may extend the term of service of a person
who has reached the age of 65, for a period
not exceeding five years. Under the proposed bill the problem is tackled from the
other side. That is, that there is no retirement age limit in the bill, but it is provided
that the governor in council may by regulation establish the conditions for retirement.
But there is also provision in the bill that
under those same regulations he may
establish conditions for the continuance of
a person in the service for a period beyond
what the regulations say is his retirement
age. It is true that in the one instance you
are dealing with a particular case as it arises.
Under the bill you would be dealing, possibly, in a more general way by regulations.
That does not disturb me very much, because
the same hand that makes the regulations
can always change them, or make new ones;
and if a case is encountered that requires
special treatment, I am sure the necessary
regulation would be passed. I do not think

572

SENATE

we need be too much concerned about the
change that the bill makes in that regard.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members, I
am not going to follow the line of argument
of my honourable friend who has just taken
his seat. He has made his points clearly.
But I am and have long been disturbed about
this superannuation fund, as to whether it is
actuarially sound. It is true that about $175
million has been put into the fund, but I
understood the promotor of the bill to say
the other day that it was about $189 million
short. I do not know how that amount is
arrived at. I listened with much interest
to what the honourable member from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) said on this
point last night. I think that the committee
to which the bill is sent should bring the
officials before it to tell us how the fund
stands from an actuarial standpoint. It is
unrealistic not to do so, because this is
really a plan by the government to insure
civil servants se that when they attain a certain age and retire they will get a monthly
income for the rest of their lives. Just as
with an insurance policy or an annuity plan,
there must be sufficient money in the fund
to make the payments.
I have had a little experience with superannuation problems. In 1905 the Winnipeg
School Board, of which I was a member
for many many years, started a pension plan
for its teachers. A teacher receiving a salary
of $1,000 paid into the fund $10 a year; a
teacher receiving $1,250, paid in $15 per
year; and any whose salary was above that
paid in $20 per year.
Teachers' salaries
were lower than now, but $1,000 in 1905 would
certainly buy more goods then than $2,000
would today. That plan was continued until
at lcast 1921, as I know, for I was on the board
until the end of that year; and during the last
six years that I served there some members
were terribly agitated because newer members queStioned the ability of the fund to meet
its liabilities. Well, what happened? It went
along in that way for, I should think, eight
or nine years, until the board was suddenly
confronted with the fact that the fund could
not pay any more superannuation at all. So
the board had to enter into a new agreement;
it bought a Dominion Government annuity
for each teacher, to become effective at retirement age. The board was supposed to pay
half of the cost, and the other half was put
up, and is still being put up, by the taxpayers of Winnipeg.
The fact was that
teachers who were on the staff from 1905
to about 1950, never paid sufficient into the
pension fund to enable it to meet its obligations. As a member of the board, I criticized
and made all the trouble I could all along,
but I got nowhere.

Because of my experiences as a member of
that board I think we should find out what
are the actuarial requirements of the superannuation scheme now before us, and the
federal treasury should pay enough money
to make it actuarially sound. We cannot
go back to the people who have already been
retired, but we can make persons employed
from now on pay enough to keep the fund on
a sound actuarial basis. A number of mutual
life insurance companies-I will not mention
names-used to sell a policy of $1,000 or
$2,000 for $12 or $14 a year. Some people
told the policyholders that it was not
actuarially sound, but they would not listen
to the warning. Well, it was no surprise to
me when the legislature-of which I was
then a member-was suddenly confronted
with the fact that for each policy of, say,
$2,000, the companies had a reserve of only
$1,000.
The legislature had to pass an Act
reducing the amount of the policies; otherwise,
the policy holders would have had to pay an
additional premium.
I am well aware that we are short about
$189 million under the commitments to the
superannuation fund and that we will likely
go farther behind. But what will happen if
the time comes when business is not as brisk
as it is today and our revenues are lower?
At some stage of the game we have to get
down to a sound and fundamental basis on
which we can carry our obligations through
to the end.
I come now to the question of the course the
Senate should follow with respect to this
lcgislation. I am bitterly disappointed that
this bill did not reach us a month or six
weeks ago, when we had time to give it the
thorough examination it deserves. No other
body is better qualified than is the Senate
to deal with the proposed changes. I say that
for the reason that we are not subject to
political dictation. We do not have to worry
about the attitude of the civil servants in
Winnipeg, or Regina or Halifax. Of course,
we have to remember, as the honourable
senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) bas
said, that the public service is the life blood
of the government of Canada. We all know
that the British people boast of the greatness
of their public service. I would like to be
able te make the same boast about the public
service of Canada.
I know many public
officials who, had they gone into the mercantile business, would have made some of us
who think we have done fairly well look like
second-raters. But while we are thinking of
the higher officials, let us not forget the rank
and file members of the service who do much
to maintain its high standard.
I am reminded of an experience in conducting an election campaign in 1914. I had

MAY 5, 1953
the task of canvassing my district, which consisted for the most part of factory and railway employees. My practice was to call at
the homes in the afternoon, when I was
invariably told by the wife that her husband
would return from work at a quarter past five.
On one such call I informed a housewife
that I proposed to hold a meeting in the red
school, and that I would try to return in time
to see her husband. I arrived at his gateway
at the same time he did, and there saw his
children run out to greet him and grab him
by the legs. As he picked up the smallest
one in his arms I was struck with the
thought that these children had as much right
to the good things of life as my own children
had. From that moment I never forgot the
place which the family of modest means
holds in the community.
As to the bill itself, we should have every
opportunity to study it and examine the
officials to find out what it actually proposes
to do. Perhaps I should not say what I have
in mindHon. Mr. Lambert: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. Haig: -but
I think there is
another place within a hundred miles of here
which does not pay as much attention to
the details of legislation as we do. I can
understand why that is so; perhaps if I were
in that other place I too would have an eye
to the political effect of legislation. But the
measure now before us is, to my way of
thinking, more important than the bill having
to do with the Canadian National Railways
which we dealt with in committee this morning. I was hopeful that this legislation would
be allowed to stand over until next sessionwhich will likely be in the fall-but the
remarks of the honourable senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) would indicate
that that is most unlikely. In any event, I
suggest, within the next two years the Senate
should undertake a study of the whole Civil
Service superannuation plan, in much the
same way as it reviewed a few years ago
the income tax law. I would remind honourable senators that although at first the government turned down the recommendations
of the special committee appointed to study
the Income Tax Act, all %hose recommendations have since been incorporated in the
law of Canada.
Unlike my honourable friends from Ponteix
(Hon. Mr. Marcotte) and from De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Vien), I am taking no side with
regard to this bill. I merely say that I am
not clear on the whole matter. I know-and
the point was emphasized by the honourable
senator from Toronto--that if government
regulations prove unworkable, they are soon

replaced by a new set of regulations. I am
sure the country will approve such legislation in respect of our civil servants as will
satisfy them. No staff is worth its pay if it
is a dissatisfied staff.
I am in favour of the bill being referred
to a committeé of the house, particularly for
the purpose of studying more closely the
financial aspects of the bill and to find an
answer to the question asked by the honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon.
Mr. Reid):. Where is the money now?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I would like to know where
it is.
Hon. Mr. Haig: For those reasons, honourable senators, I am in favour of the bill
being referred to a committee at an early
date.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. J. W. de B. Farris: Honourable senators, in my seventeen years in the Senate
not a session has passed but I have heard the
same old complaint that the Senate is called
upon to consider legislation at such a late
date in the session that it is impossible to
give it adequate consideration. I wonder
sometimes who is basically at fault. The
Senate is not compelled to pass any bill until
it is satisfied that the proposed legislation
is proper.
As to the bill before us, I too feel that we
should have more time to consider it. However, I would not take the responsibility of
voting against it now, nor of challenging the
practice which has gone on since Confederation, by delaying at the last minute the
prorogation of parliament in order that the
Senate might further consider a number of
bills.
Early in the next session however, we
should know whether the Senate is again to
be required, in the last days of the session,
to consider and pass important legislation.
Failing a satisfactory assurance, if the
honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig)
will state that he intends if necessary to
hold up prorogation of parliament pending
proper consideration of the legislation then
before us, I will join him in that stand. Under
those circumstances we should not hesitate
to keep the House of Commons in session, if
necessary, for another two or three weeks,
while we give the legislatiron before us sufficient consideration. With that fair warning
to the other house, I think the people of
Canada would back us up in that stand.
However, as I said, I think the honourable
leader opposite is the one who should spearhead such a movement; and I for one would
be glad to join him.

furtherance of the use and enjoyment by our
people of television and radio, an amount
equal to the returns received by way of excise

decision carries a popular and constructive
appeal. It gets rid of a direct levy, a nuisance
and an annoying tax, and although another
tax is substituted, it is indirect and provides
revenues for the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation. With the assurance of this grant
year by year, the corporation can look ahead
and estimate with some certainty what its
revenues will be. It is one of the methods by
which parliament can provide money for commissions and corporations as well as for
departments. The other way would be in the
form of estimates, but the government bas
chosen to do it in this statutory way as a
matter of policy. I suppose one could argue

about $80 million, and about 15 per cent of
this amount would produce revenue of
roughly $10 million.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: How much revenue did

NORTHERN PACIFIC HALIBUT FISHERY
CONVENTION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Thomas Reid moved the second reading of Bill 341, an Act to implement a convention between Canada and the United
States for the preservation of the halibut
fishery.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to obtain approval for ratification of the convention or treaty between
Canada and the United States of America for
the preservation of the halibut fishery of
the Northern Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea,
signed by Canada and the United States of
America in Ottawa on March 2, 1953, replacing the 1937 convention, and to provide the
necessary legislation to implement the new
convention. May I point out that the first
treaty was signed in June, 1923, and it is
interesting to know that this marked the first
occasion on which a treaty was signed by a
minister of the Canadian government. It was
signed by the late Right Honourable Ernest
Lapointe, then Minister of Justice. I would
also point out that this was the first treaty
ever signed to control international fisheries
in the high seas.
In 1932 the period for halibut fishing was
eight and one-half months, and in that year
some 44 million pounds of halibut were
caught. Because of improved methods of
fishing and the increase in the size and numbers of fishing vessels, approximately 56
million pounds of halibut were caught in a
period of only one month in 1951.
Honourables senators, the bill before the
bouse contains four amendments. The first
amendment changes the name of the commission from "The International Pacific Fisheries
Commission" to "The International Pacific
Halibut Commission". When the treaty was
first signed, in 1923, it was the only international fisheries treaty in existence but since
then a series of international treaties have
been signed by Canada for the preservation
of fisheries on our coasts and the coasts of
other countries, and it has been thought that
we must now be more specific in our designation of this commission. That is why the
commission will henceforth be known under
the new name which I mentioned.
The second amendment results from a
request made by the Americans. The United
States government would now like to give
representation on the commission to the territory of Alaska, and it has asked that the
number of commissioners for each country
be increased to three, so that this may be

SENATE
done. In the United States the control of
fi::hcriecs rests principally with thp indlividuail
states rather than with the federal government, and Alaska, a territory belonging to
the United States, has demanded representation on the commission. At the present time
there are only four commissioners, two from
each country. This number is to be enlarged
to three, so as to make provision for a representative from Alaska.
Some doubts were raised by legal officials
of the United States government as to whether
under the treaty the commission had power
to establish more than one period of time or

season for halibut fishing.
pointed out that quotas are set each year
for catching halibut, and last year some 62
million pounds were caught in a period of
less than two months. The members of the
commission feel that there should be two or
three fishing periods at different times of the
year, rather than one open season.
The last amendment is a very minor one.
Fishing on the actual halibut banks has been
controlled, but halibut can be caught on the
West Coast in other areas incidentally to fishing for cod or sole or other groundfish. There
have been regulations to control the sale or
disposal of halibut caught in other areas
during the closed season while the fishermen
are fishing for other species, but there has
been no regulation to control halibut caught
incidentally to other fishing in the open season.
The new convention makes provision for
that.
Honourable senators, except for these minor
changes the treaty will be the same in all
other respects as the previous one. In conclusion, I should like to point out one further
interesting feature with regard to the treaty.
The original treaty was signed, as I said
before, by the late Right Honourable Ernest
Lapointe, Minister of Justice. The present
treaty bears the signature of his son the
Honourable Hugues Lapointe, Minister of
Veterans Affairs, and that of the Honourable
James Sinclair, Minister of Fisheries.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: How does the treaty
deal with the incidental catching of halibut
that my honourable friend spoke about?
Hon. Mr. Reid: At the present time we have
regulations to control the disposal of halibut
caught during the closed season, but there
have been no regulations to control halibut
caught incidentally to other fishing during the
open halibut season. The new convention
will make provision for that.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: What is done with the
halibut that is caught incidentally to other
fishing?

Hon. Mr. Reid: That is quite a question.
I have mv own ideas about what has happened
to halibut that has been caught in that way,
but I would rather not place my views on
record. I know that provision is being made
to take care of that situation.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: How are the Japanese
fishing fleets controlled?

will be controlled under the International
Convention for the High Seas Fisheries of

The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
THIRD READING
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall the bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, as
this bill proposes only minor changes to the
treaty I would move that it be now read the
third time.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
SALACIOUS AND INDECENT LITERATURE
REPORT OF COMMITTEE CONSIDEREDDEBATE ADJOURNED
The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the report of the Special Committee appointed
to inquire into the sale and distribution of
salacious and indecent literature in Canada.
Hon. W. Ruper± Davies: Honourable senators, I wish that at this late hour I could
simply move the adjournment of this discussion but, unfortunately, owing to sickness in
my family I cannot be here tomorrow, and
I do not know if I could come on Thursday.
So if you will bear with me for a while,
although I cannot promise to be brief, I shall
be as brief as possible.
I do not like reading speeches; I feel that
they lose something by being read. When I
was campaigning some years ago I thought I
had some fire, but I do not know if I have
any left. I do know, though, that if I read
much of what I have to say, it loses a great
deal of the effect it might otherwise have.
However, I have very copious notes here,
and so that I may not wander too far afield
I shall, with your permission, follow them
pretty closely.
As honourable senators know, the special
committee appointed by this honourable body
to inquire into the sale and distribution of

MAY 5, 1953
indecent and salacious literature has held
many meetings and received much notice in
the press of Canada. I feel that the thanks
of the Senate is due to the members of this
committee for the painstaking way in which
they have carried out their assignment and
for the patient and sympathetic hearings they
have given to the various witnesses and delegations that have come before them.
I should like to pay a tribute to the late
Honourable Senator Doone, from Charlotte,
New Brunswick, who originated this committee. It was a great blow to his fellow senators when he was called in the prime of life.
I am aware that tributes to his memory were
expressed here shortly after his death, but I
think it is fitting that before starting to deal
with the work of the committee which he
founded, I should say a few words about him.
The late senator was a sincere, conscientious
man, who before he entered the Senate, had
given splendid service to his native province
of New Brunswick. He was always much
interested in matters that came before this
honourable body. I am sure he undertook to
head the committee on indecent literature
with an earnest desire to do something to
cure what he regarded as a menace to the
life of young Canadians. It is a great pity
that he could not have lived to see the work
of his committee completed.
The sittings of the committee have all been
widely reported in the press; -alro by the
Senate Hansard staff, for the use of the senators who are not members of the committee.
This was, I feel, a very wise arrangement:
it not only preserved a record of the sittings,
but gave us all a chance to read the proceedings in detail carefully and to form our own
conclusions about them.
This question of indecent literature is a
very big one, and because it has had such
publicity in the press of Canada I should
like to deal with some features of the submissions to the committee.
We all realize that certain problems which
affect our everyday life in Canada are
insoluble. We also realize, I think, that our
attempts to solve some of these problems by
prohibitory measures have not been very
satisfactory. One of our greatest problems
used to be the liquor traffic, and at one time
I believed prohibition was the answer to it.
I worked hard for prohibition, believing it
would make for a more sober and righteous
nation. I headed up the organization in my
county, and for the first time we recorded
a majority for the temperance cause there.
I was delighted and thought we had made
a great step forward. Honourable senators,

I was never more mistaken in my life. Prohibition was, in my opinion, a complete and
absolute failure. It did not stop either drinking or drunkenness. It encouraged illicit
drinking, and made a lot of scoundrelly and
unscrupulous people rich.
The trouble with prohibition was that it
was a severe, regulatory law which interfered with what many people regarded as
personal rights and freedoms. The problem
of the liquor traffic had become a very confused one. Many people believed that the
mere physical act of taking a drink of intoxicating liquor was a mortal sin. On the other
hand we had in Ontario thousands of respectable citizens-decent, normal, law-abiding,
church-going citizens-who desired an occasional drink of liquor. They resented prohibition and purchased what liquor they
wanted from bootleggers illegally. Furthermore, they did not feel the slightest shame
about it.
Prohibition, I repeat, was a failure. It
did one thing, however: it eventually put the
liquor business in the hands of provincial
governments, and made it not only respectable
out a money-maker for the provinces. I quite
realize that the liquor traffic has nothing to
do with the sale and distribution of indecent
and salacious literature. I mention it, merely
to show how a Canadian legislature tried to
deal with a difficult problem-on the rights
and wrongs of which the people held divided
opinions-and to point out what a failure
it was.
The committee whose report I am discussing met on many occasions and heard many
delegations. It also received many briefs
which were sent in from organizations in
various parts of the dominion.
I should like to warmly congratulate the
committee on its report. In my opinion it
is a very wise one, and, considering the
rather extreme statements made by some
witnesses, a very restrained, fair one. I
feel that the committee is deserving of the
congratulations of this honourable body
upon its very very constructive report.
I followed the reports of the committee
meetings carefully. The committee was, as
I have said, very patient. I felt, however,
that it had to listen to far too much generalization. There seemed to be too many
witnesses who were over-anxious to condemn certain magazines and books that are
to be found in the bookstores, news stands,
cigar stores, station waiting rooms, etc., without very much, if any, proof of the ill
effects of these publications. I felt that many
witnesses would have been much more convincing if they had been more specifle.

SENATE

There is one thing which I think we should
keeo in mind, and that is that the sale and
distribution of books and magazines, whether
decent or indecent, is a business. It is an
important business, and one which gives
employment to thousands of people in this
country today. Furthermore, the printing and
distribution of pocket editions of books gives
work to quite a large number of printers,
bookbinders and salespeople. It is a serious
thing to interfere with a business, even with
a business which some may think has features of doubtful value. While I quite realize
that many people feel that any business
which in their opinion does harm to the
morals of our people is entitled to no consideration, we must not forget that there
are two sides to every question.
In addressing this honourable body today
I am speaking as a senator, but I find it hard
to forget that I am also a newspaper publisher and also that I am an unashamed
reader of what are commonly known as
"whodunits". The "whodunits", or the
mystery-detective stories, are very popular.
They are read by possibly a million men and
women in Canada and by millions in the
United States. A recent magazine article
stated that some 30 million copies of the
cheap books by Erskine Caldwell had been
sold in the United States. As honourable
senators know, one of Erskine Caldwell's
books was the subject-matter of a prosecution in an Ottawa court n-ot long ago.
For the most part these books are quite
harmless morally. I am sure they have no
ill effects on adults, and I think it is open
to question where they seriously affect
younger people who read them. As a matter
of fact, I doubt very much if many teenagers read mystery-detective stories. I have
inquired from some of the dealers both here
and in Toronto and they tell me that the
younger people buy what are known as
comics, some crime-comics, and western
adventure stories.
May I interject the remark that I am more
familiar with these publications in the pocketbook form than with magazines. I have
examined news stands here in Ottawa carefully.
It was said by more than one witness before
the committee that many book covers are
objectionable because they play up the halfnaked female. Now, in this modern world,
when we have the two-piece bathing suit,
and even the Bikini bathing suit, when we
have "Miss This" and "Miss That" chosen for
this and that prize because she looks more
attractive in a skimp bathing suit than her
competitors do, we are used to seeing the
female form divine half naked as we were
not twenty-five and thirty years ago. My

objection is not to the display of naked female
pulchritude on book covers, but to the fact
tnat in too many cases Lie illuLatiu ont thc
front of a book has no relation whatever to
the contents inside the covers.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Reid: You were disappointed, were
you?
Hon. Mr. Farris: We must have that
changed.
Hon. Mr. Davies: I would not go as far as
some have suggested and advocate that the
covers should be plain, unadorned with any
picture. That is the English style; it is not
the American nor the Canadian style. But I
do think that the publishers should play down
the sexy covers and always try to have on the
front cover a picture which relates to the
story. We must remember, though, that no
more nakedness is displayed on the covers of
these pocket detective stories than in the
pages of many high-class magazines.
It is worthy of note that there are at the
present time many nudist magazines for sale
in Great Britain; they appear on practically
every news stand in that country. The
Associated Press of April 6 carried a dispatch
to the effect that the higher councils of British
nudism had put out feelers to see if there
would be any objection to nude bathing on
public beaches. I do not know what the
attitude is in this respect in Britain, but some
six years or seven years ago when I undertook
to go for a swim near the city of Boston,
wearing a pair of trunks, a police officer blew
his whistle and said "Better get something on,
buddy." Of course, I had to do what I was
told. Whether the British people are more
moral than the Canadian people, I do not
know, but the book Forever Amber was
banned in Britain. To my thinking it was a
most silly and innocuous book. I read only
about a third of it, and then became disgusted
with it.
As I understand the object of the committee
which has just made its report, it was to try
to protect the young people of our country
against the immoral influence of certain
books and magazines. It was not particularly
concerned with what the adult population of
Canada reads. I hope this is so. I know that
was not the view of some of the extremists
who submitted briefs to the committee.
I do not believe that the Senate has any
business at all to legislate as to what I or
my fellow-men and fellow-women shall read;
that is our own business and nobody else's.
If a man or woman gets a thrill out of reading an exciting sexy novel, who am I to say
them nay? After all, this is a free -country
and we are not the keepers of our brothers'

MAY 5. 1953
consciences. It seemns to me this honourable
body would be going far afield if it attempted
to deny to aduit Canadians the right to
choose their own reading matter.
I know that there are quite a lot of people
in Canada who feel that they are qualified
to decide what people shail read and what
they shall fot read. This group of people is
divided into two classes: First, those who
sincerely believe that in some way they have
a mission to regulate the morals of their
fellow mortals. Many of these are quite sincere. And secondly, there is the all-toonumerous group which loves to mind other
people's business, and delights in regulating
their lives. The more laws this group can
have passed restricting the freedoms of
people, the better it is satisfied. Too often
many memnbers .of this group know littie
about the things of which they complain.
A few years ago I was startled to learn
that a relative of mine was among a group
who went to Toronto to attempt to ban the
magazine Esqui.re. I cal'led on this lady and
asked her if she knew anything about the
magazine, and if she had ever read a copy.
She said she had only seen a copy supplied
by another lady member of the delegation
which. met in Toronto. Beyond that, she
admitted, she knew nothing about the magazine. I set out to tell her that it was a men's
magazine, selling at 50 cents a copy, and
published for the purpose of advertising the
latest styles in men's clothing. I assured her
that it was a hîgh-class publication, although
it did contain pictures of semi-nude women.
I arn ashamed, honourable senators, that
one of my own relatives should attempt to
ban a magazine of that type.
I cali to mind another incident, which
happened when I was publishing a weekiy
newspaper in an Ontario town. Two ladies
called on me-one of themn a teacher of the
primary department in the Sunday school
of which I was superintendent at the tîmeand asked me to write an article condemnîng
the bad movies currently shown at the local
cinema. I asked themn, "Do you ever go to
the movies?" They replîed "Oh, no". When
I queried them as to, how they knew the
movies were bad, they told me th.at they had
been so informed. "Ladies", I said, "'let me
tell you that the manager of the theatre is
having a hard time. When he came to me
a while ago and asked what he should do,
I suggested that he run a series of high-class
travelogues, whîch he did." Then I asked te
ladies whether they had patronized those
high-quality pictures, and they admitted they
had not.

Those people, honourable senators, were
typical of many of the witnesses who
appeared before the Senate committee. They
brought in brief s and taiked about many
things about which, they knew littie or
nothing.
The committee had before it in February
a lady who represented a very well-known
national organization and one which does a
great deal of good. She brought with her some
books and magazines which she laid before
the committee, pointing out that they were
very bad indeed. Let me read an extract
from her statement before the committee.
She said:
The great volume of sex books, comic type papers.
and newspapers-

without any distinguishing mark, are lînked
with sex books and comic-type papers.
-samples of whieh I have with me here. is a
greater menace te the youth of the country than it
is to aduits. Not only are these books morally
degraded, but they are also intellectually of the very
lowest order. They are written in bail English and
often there is hardly any attempt at a plot in a
story.

In the course of the questioning, one
honourable senator on the committee asked
if the magazines and books complained of
were printed in Canada, or imported from
the United States. She replied:
I do not know wbat they are. We just went to a
news stand and beught them. I think most of themn
are imported. I really did net read them. I just
looked at the outalde covers.

Now, honourable senators, can you imagine
anything quite s0 fantastic? Here is a witness,
a responsible witness, who comes before a
Senate committee with a group of magazines
and books, and, she said, some newspapers.
She wants them taken off the news stands,
and yet she admits that she does not know
whether they are Canadian or imported, and
she does not know what is inside the covers.
For ail she knew, they might have contaîned
The Arabian Nights Entertainments, or Alice
in Wonderland, or Sunday School stories.
I want to touch for a few minutes on
censorship. The word "censorship" cropped
Up in the committee hearings on many occasions. It is in my opinion an ugly word, a
very ugly word. In war times censorship of
war news may be necessary. Those of us
who have suffered from it know how irksome
it can become. But war is one thing: peace
is another. In peace time I will oppose to
my utmost, censorship of books produced mn
Canada. We have a censorship in connection
with the importation of books into Canada.
I read the evidence of Mr. David Sim, the
Deputy Minister of Customs, very carefully,

SENATE

and I feel that censorship which has to do
with the importation of seditious and other
literature of questionable character is in
good hands and is not abused.
Let us not forget one thing, honourable
senators. Canada is growing up; it is now
a nation. We are taking our place in the
world, not alone in the world of arms and
international agreements, but in the world
of literature and the drama. If we are to
give to our university students a broad, literary
education, we cannot afford to assume that
they must be protected from this book and
that. We must assume, as I think we can
rightly do, that our young men and women,
students of our universities and the senior
classes of our high schools, are quite capable
of sifting the wheat from the chaff. I do not
think we need worry too much about our
young men and young women: they are just
as good as we were when young. Their ideals
are just as high as ours were; and I am sure
they are not going to be led away from the
paths of rectitude by a lot of cheap books
and magazines. They may read some of
them as a relaxation, as many of us do, but
these publications are not going to make any
lasting impression.
If, as has been suggested by some witnesses
who appeared before the committee, we set
up a board of censors to pass on the books
that shall be sold in the book stores of
Canada, just who are going to be the censors?

Let us not forget that, if we ever make that
great mistake-and I pray ta God we never
will-we shall be putting into the hands of
the government of the day a most powerful
weapon. Censorship, once it raised its ugly
head in Canada in peacetime, would not stop

at salacious literature.

It would soon want

to pass on religious literature, then it would

want to pass on scientific literature; and
from that to political books would be a
short step-a very short step indeed. From
books censorship would spread to magazines
and then to newspapers. That would be
a sorry day for Canada.
It is more than three hundred years agoto be exact, in 1644-since that great English
poet John Milton published his Areopagitica.
In that great address to the lords and the
commons he was pleading for the freedom of
the press and freedom of thought. As he
very properly asked, "What censor or body
of censors could decide what was truth and
what was error?" Time alone would tell,
he said. Good books would live and bad
books would die. Milton did not believe in
protected virtue. He believed that character
was formed by overcoming vice and error.
May I give you one more quotation:

He that can apprehend and consider vice with all
her baits and seeming pleasures, and yet abstain and
vet distinguish, and yet prefer that which is truly
better, he is the true wayfaring Unristian.

To follow up that last quotation: there is,
or seems ta be, too much of a tendency on the
part of some of the witnesses who appeared
before the committee to assume that the
news stands are filled with nothing but
detective and western and sexy stories. That
is not true. I thought the brief presented to
the committee on Wednesday, February 11,
by the Canadian Home and School and
Parent-Teacher Federation Incorporated, was
in some parts very constructive. But I certainly do not agree with the statement that
"the pocket-edition stands in the stores present a picture that is a national disgrace."
That statement is, in my opinion, very much
exaggerated. I went around to most of the
places in Ottawa where these pocket books
are sold, and looked them over carefully.
I noted a few of the titles I saw on a news
stand-not in a book store-right here a
Here they are:
couple of weeks ago.
The Greatest Story Ever Told, a life of Jesus
Christ by Fulton Oursler; The Cardinal, by

Henry Morton Robinson; The Black Rose,
by T. B. Costain; The Dialogues of Plato; The

Sir Walter Scott; Lost Horizon, by James
Hilton; The Bishop's Mantle; 30 Days to a
More Powerful Vocabulary; A Study of
Evolution; How to Start a Stamp Album;
The Book of Quotations. All these are good

books. So when one is looking for a detective or a mystery story one is confronted with
these titles; and I am quite sure that many of
them are bought, or they would not be on the
stands for sale.
As I said before, one of the great objections
to a board of censors-and let me say how
glad I am the committee did not recommend
a board of censors, although the suggestion
was made and the matter brought up by a
number of witnesses-is that no two people
can agree on what is good and what is bad.

a great deal about this production. Almost
everybody I met asked me, "Have you seen

my wife and myself. Well, I have never seen
a more brazenly disgusting show in all my
life. We walked out after the first act, notwithstanding that the tickets had cost me
$15.80. And just ta think that my mother was

have allowed that show to run for a week,
but apparently it had already been running
in New York for two or three years and a lot
of people had thought it was all right.
On Tuesday, April 21, Mr. John H. Palmer,
President and Managing Director of Harlequin Books Limited, of Toronto, Ontario,
appeared before the committee. An honourable member of the committee asked the
question "Then you believe in censorship?".
Mr. Pa'mer replied:
I certainly do. As I wrote in my letter, it is
not a matter any more of freedom of the press,

publishers don't quite know what to do ourselves.
We have in our company four editors who read
books and then fil out a form saying whether they
are salacious, or questionably salacious, or whether
they contain any swearing and so on. Then we
sit down once a week and discuss a book. Our
editors are becoming nervous wrecks, because we
are beginning to wonder what is

books which we have turned down. We don't want
to get into that type of business; indeed, we will
close our doors before we become publishers of
salacious literature. But we know if we close
our doors someone is going to spring up and take
our place, and they will take it on the basis that
they are doing Canadians. Canadian authors will
be only too happy to welcome them because they
have no one else to turn to.

Mr. Palmer made the fatal mistake of
leaving with the committee a list of books
which his company publishes. The list was
made an appendix to the proceedings of the
committee. I reviewed it, and I can say that
it contains the names of half a dozen of the
very worst stories I have ever read. Some
of them were so bad that I couldn't finish
them. There is one book in particular which,
if I had my way, I would never allow to be
published. Many of the stories deal with
rape, adultery and everything else that is
evil, and yet this same Mr. Palmer wants to
see a censorship board established because
his editors are becoming nervous wrecks.
It sounds like hypocrisy to me.
Hon. Mr. Reid: They must have been reading
their own books.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Honourable senators, the
question of censorship has received a lot of
attention. The establishment of a system of
censorship was mentioned many times during
the hearings of the committee, but it was
encouraging to note that a number of witnesses were opposed to it. Being a member
of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, I was
very glad to note that the Reverend Dr. Robert
Good of Ottawa, representing that Church,
expressed himself before the committee as
opposed to censorship or anything that savors

of dictatorship over the human conscience. I
noted, too, that the Reverend Dr. McInnes, of
Orillia, the Moderator of the Presbyterian
Church, took the same stand in an address or
interview which was published in the Toronto
Globe and Mail.
Mr. D. L. Michael, the Executive Secretary
of Public Relations of the Seventh Day
Adventist Church, who appeared before the
He
committee, also opposed censorship.
stated that he believed in the complete freedom of the press, as one of the inalienable
rights of free men living in a free country.
He deplored the threat of filthy and vulgar
literature. He also expressed confidence in
the committee. In replying to a question by
the honourable senator from Huron-Perth
(Hon. Mr. Golding) he said "We are very
apprehensive about any attempt to legislate
in matters of morals and conscience. We feel
that it is fraught with dangers that are very
real."
I was very much impressed, too, by the
views of His Eminence James Cardinal
McGuigan, of Toronto. Cardinal McGuigan,
who is very highly regarded in his home city
by people of all creeds and faiths, is not only
a very able scholar and preacher, but a broadminded and tolerant gentleman. He is a
regular weekly contributor to the Toronto
Telegram. In the issue of Saturday, March
14, he discussed the sale of indecent and
salacious literature in his weekly column. He
condemned vigorously what he termed "the
promotion and sale of filth".
Cardinal McGuigan points out the effect of
impure and immoral literature on the youth of
what he so warmly describes as "our own
beloved country". But I was pleased to note
that at no time did he suggest that a board
of censors should be established with general
supervision over the reading matter of the
adult Canadian public. Cardinal McGuigan
suggests that:
Some method should be found and enforced,
whereby they (the pocket books) would be made
available for the adults who desired them, while
the youth would be protected as far as possible
from their danger.

"It would not be difficult", says the Cardinal, "to set up a practical scheme and enforce
it, if responsible authors, publishers, sellers,
parents and public officials co-operated".
With the views of Cardinal McGuigan
I am very much in accord. I shall refer to
them again a little later.
Honourable senators, this mention of censorship has brought protests from all quarters
of Canada. I have here a number of extracts
from editorials and newspaper articles which
I wanted to read into the record. As the hour
is late I shall not read them, but I would ask
honourable senators to allow me to place
them on Hansard.

SENATE

The Hon. the Speaker: Has the honourable
senator the leave of the Senate?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Agreed.
Sone Hon. Senators: Agreed.
The quotations are as follows:
Editorial headed "Let's Be On Guard" from
the Vancouver Sun, March 23, 1953:
Those who value freedorm of expression and
thought in Canada had best be on guard.
Too little attention is being paid to the proceedings of the Canadian Senate's special committee
on the sale of "salacious and indecent literature."
From any angle a study of ils proceedings seems
to indicate a desire on the part of some members
of this committee to appoint a board of censors to
regulate the publication of books in Canada. There's
reason to think also that some would like to clamp
a censorship on the newspapers of Canada too.
That this impression of the Senate committee is
becoming current in informed circles is witnessed
by the statement appearing in the letter columns
on his page today from the British Columbia ParentTeacher Federation. In it the Federation seeks to
correct "erroneous impressions" that it is seeking
censorship of adult reading.
The Federation is
emphatically against censorship but the fact that
its brief to the committee should be distorted by
rumor as it has been is testimony that the atmosphere in which that committee's hearings are conducted is contrary to freedom.
It is felt by observers who've seen the committee
in action that some members of the committee have
definite leanings to censorship. This allegedly was
evident in the treatment of Judge Allan Fraser of
the Ottawa Family Court who attacked not only
the books but newspapers generally for their handling of crime news. Certain members of the committee appeared to seize upon his opinions with an
air of triumph that bodes ill for freedom.
On the other hand when the pastor of Ottawa's
Erskine Presbyterian Church voiced strong opposition to any form of censorship to assure morality
and good living the impression was gained-from
the way he was cross-examined by committee members-that they weren't satisfied with this sensible
stand.
It's true that some people are always ready to
regulate the lives of others. And as a rule the
people as a whcle have the good sense to repudiate
moves in that direction. But the tenor of the Senate
committee hearings indicates that a danger exists
and that certain interests in this country may be
working quietly in a direction that would endanger
essential liberties.
There's every reason to be on guard.

Letter from Secretary of British Columbia
Parent-Teacher Association to editor of
Vancouver Sun, March 23, 1953:
The British Columbia Parent-Teacher Federation
has been concerned by the erroneous impressions
given by statements that censorship of adult reading was being sought by this body.
The federation's interest in this matter arose from
a request by the chairman of a special committee
of the Senate making a study of the implementation
of section 207 of t'e
Criminal Code, that a brief
be submitted as it was the desire of the committee to have a balanced expression of opinion on
which they might base their recommendations.
This request was made to the national organization, The Canadian Home and School and ParentTeacher Federation, and at the 1952 annual meeting preparation of such a brief was authorized.
The brief so prepared stated clearly that "the
federation does not seek in any way to urge such
legislation as will censor or control adult reading."

Editorial from Toronto Telegram of March
3. 1953. entitled "Censor Board No Remedy
For Obscene Literature Evil":
Guelph's Junior Board of Trade bas launched a
crusade against salacious and indecent literature.
It plans to direct public indignation against books
and publications likely to corrupt young minds. It
proposes further to "ban" the worst of these,
through a board including representatives of the
clergy, board of education, women's organizations,
service clubs and police.
A primary difficulty is that members of such a
board will have ideas sharply at variance as to
what should or should not go on the forbidden list.
In any event, will the public accept their authority,
and will their decisions prevail with the proprietors
of newsstands? Thoughts of ibis kind have already
occurred to at least one reader of the Guelph
Mercury, who writes to that paper: "Would not
tanning of 'lewd literature' obliterate one troublesome aspect only to promote a greater?
Any
appointed board is subject to human fallibilities
and would be influenced by pressure groups, personal prejudices and local sentiment. Censorship
is the mark of a totalitarian country."
A special committee of the Canadian Senate has
been dealing with this matter for many weeks and
has heard representations from numerous groups.
The dangers of censorship are indicated in some of
the submissions. One brief asked "an overall ban
on the printing and importation of all magazines
and books which obviously have the appearance of
evil."
Censorship in any form is unlikely to be recommended in the forthcoming report. It would seem
that the most effective means of action is in better
enforcement of the Criminal Code as it concerns
the
distribution
of
objectionable
literature.
Responsibility, it bas been pointed out, lies with the
provinces. There have been some convictions, not
all sustained on appeal, but those which have stood
up have demonstrated that the weakness now is
not so much in the law as in reluctance of the
authorities to enforce il. Movements such as that
in Guelph may produce more action along that line.

Extract from the column of J. V. McAree

of the Toronto Globe and Mail, headed
Censors and Obscenity:
In a debate on immoral books several years ago
somebody, Heywood Broun, we think, defied the
upholders of censorship to produce anybody who
had ever been corrupted by a book. Nobody was
produced, though we think the challenge was
rhetorical. But admitting the possibility that children might be corrupted are we to take the ground
that no book should be written which might bring
the blush of shame to the damask cheek of any
young maiden? To ask the question is enough to
dismiss the idea that this kind of censorship would
be tolerated or could be enforced. We think there
is hardly any book worth reading that does not contain something which might offend or shock some
hypothetical reader. The Bible is full of passages
which will raise blushes in some faces. So are
Shakespeare and practically all the great classical
writers.
The effort to free Shakespeare from
coarsenses has given us the word "bowdlerize," held
in universal contempt.
We think that the problem is one for the law
courts, not for censors.
They are capable of
determining what is obscene and what is not
obscene, though we do not envy them the task. It
may be that the law governing the matter ought
to be amended.
Conceivably it ought to te
stricter. There are certain limits in speech and
writing which decent people will not exceed and if
these could be defined perhaps we would have a
basis on whieh new laws might be established.

MAY 5, 1953

May I say to the committee that it should
feel that the many hours the members have
given to the hearings before it have been
fully justified, as is proved by the widespread attention the sittings have received
from the press. One of the most important
contributions appeared in the magazine Mayfair for March, 1953, when that nationallyknown editor, writer and lecturer, Dr. B. K.
Sandwell, wrote a full-dress article covering
several pages. It was headed "Should We
Censor Sex?" I should like to have the permission of the house to place an extract from
this article on the record:
So changeable are the concepts of what Is and
is not moral that students of today find it hard
to believe that the plays of Ibsen, and especially
The DoW's House, were violently attacked both in
their native land of Norway and in England as
profoundly subversive of that important institution,
the family. The truth is that nearly every writing
which comes eventually to be accepted as a classic,
or on its way to become so, was hailed with violent
abuse at its first appearance on the ground that
it undermined some cherished element of the
accepted order. The classics are full of matter
which has just as much "tendency to deprave"
those who are open to be depraved as any contemporary novel, and which was denounced as tending
to depravity when it first appeared.
But time
sheds its soft patina on anything that was written
over a hundred years ago, and nobody now worries
about the possible effects on young Canadians of
the poems of Byron, of Shakespeare, the unbowdlerized Burns, the lusty novels of Defoe, the
delightful Golden Ass of Apuleius, or any other of
hundreds of works which in their time attracted
the fiery denunciations of moralists. The state cannot legislate for adolescents without legislating in
the same manner for adults. If it is going to prevent
Tommy Jones, aged sixteen, from using his fifty
cents to buy The Naked and the Dead-which incidentally is not going to afford him much satisfaction beyond the thrill of seeing in print a number
of words which he knows already but which lie
has been assured are unprintable-it will have to
prevent Professor Lucius Smythe, head of the
Department of English Literature, from buying it
also. Indeed the state's agent, the customs censor,
does already prevent Professor Smythe from buyIng The Memoirs of Iecate County and did until
quite recently prevent him from buying Ulysses,
unless lie could get over to a state which is more
tolerant and violate the custorns rule by bringing
it back in his personal bag.
Discrimination by age limit, Professor Smythe
being sixty-five, is difficult even in the case of the
theatre, and In the bookstore it is obviously impossible, since the adolescent can always get an
adult to buy the book for him. But the ides that
the professor must not be allowed to possess Hecate
County because there is a one-in-a-thousand chance
that Tommy Jones might read it and be depraved
by its perusal strikes me as being one which we
should not entertain unless we are very certain
that Tommy would actually be depraved, and furthermore that lie can be actually and permanently
saved from depravity if Hecate County Is withheld
from him. On this second point particularly I am
full of dubiety.
If there are any works which adolescents should
not lie permitted to read but adults should, the
state is not the authority to do the prohibiting, not
being able to distinguish between adolescents and
adults. The proper authority always used to be.

and in my opinion still is, the family, operating
through its head, whichever sex that head happens
to belong to. It always refreshes me when I come
across a highly placed person, and particularly a
highly placed person in the realm of organized
religion, who still feels that the family has some
responsibility for the safeguarding of the adolescent; so many people want to throw the whole
task off on the shoulder of the state working
through one or other of its two chief agents, the
policeman and the school teacher-poor overworked
individuals both of them II therefore gave three
hearty cheers when only a few days ago I read the
report of an interview given by the Moderator of
the Presbyterian Church in Canada, the Rev. J. A.
MacInnis. Dr. MacInnis said that indecent literature
would not be a danger to youth if parents accepted
their responsibility. Legislation and censorship were
not the way to improve the morals of the country.
"The onus is on the church and parents, through
the process of education in the higher things. I do
not believe we will make a moral generation
through legislation against obscene literature".
There is a striking resemblance between the
doctrine of the people who maintain that it Is the
duty of the state to prevent its subjects from
having access to books dealing freely with the
subject of sex, on the ground that a certain number
will acquire immoral sex habits by reading them,
and the doctrine of the people who maintain that
it is the duty of the state to prevent its subjects
from having access to alcoholic beverages, because
a certain number will get drunk by consuming
them.
Both doctrines involve the assumption that the
state is entitled and required to limit very sharply
the freedorn of all its subjects, in order to protect
the sobriety or the sexual continence of a small
proportion of them. Both involve also the assumption that the prohibition law can be effectually
enforced, and that if enforced it will prevent the
evils at which it is aimed. These assumptions
appear to me exceedingly doubtful, and I feel that
it is unwise for the state to limit the freedor of
its subjects unless the object for which it does
the limiting is pretty certain to be attained.
Experience showed that it was not attained by
prohibiting the sale of alcoholic beverages.
I am pretty confident that it will not be attained
by prohibiting the sale of a novel such as Women's
Barracks, currently under ban of a local court in
Ontario as being "obscene".
The subject with
which Women's Barracks deals is one which has
only recently come into the realn of public discussion, hence the outcry. But it is a subject
which is certain to remain within the field of permitted discussion, and the book is a serious contribution to the literature on that subject. We
really cannot afford to keep it out of the hands of
Professor Smythe because Tommy Jones' parents
don't take sufficient care about his reading.

Honourable senators, I want to apologize
for taking up so much of your time, but I
feel that this subject is an important one.
It is one to which a committee of this house
has given hours and hours of study, and it
is therefore impossible to deal with the matter
satisfactorily in a few minutes. As you
are all well aware, the subject of the publication of questionable books and magazines has
been occupying the thought and attention
of people in the United States as well as in
Canada. Time Magazine, under date of
January 12, 1953, deals with the work of the

SENATE
United States committee. With the permission of the house I would ask that this be
placed on Hansard.
On newsstands all over the U.S., "pornography
is big business". So reported a special House committee last week, after investigating what it called
girlie
an "incredible volume" of "cheesecake
magazines", "salacious" pocket-size books, and
The committee,
"flagrantly misnamed 'comics' ".
headed by Arkansas Democratic Congressman E.
(for Ezekiel) C. Gathings, found a big increase in
"lewd magazines" and in the number of "obscene"
books among the 200 million pocket-size books
sold in 1951.
Despite the four weeks of testimony, neither
the committee nor witnesses were always sure of
the difference between obscenity and respectable
writing. Writer Margaret Culkin Banning decried
"filth on the newsstand", said that more than
1,000 magazines published in the U.S. are nothing
more than "pictorial prostitution".
Three days
later the committee discovered that Writer Banning
herself was the author of an article titled "Is
Virginity Old-Fashioned?" (her answer: no), which
appeared in Personal Romance flanked by such
other titles as Kidnapper's Kisses, i was Accused of
Adultery and Betrayed by Sex.
On its part, the committee's brand of "obscene"
was also slapped on some books by such wellknown writers as John Steinbeck, James T. Farrell,
Erskine Caldwell and Italian novelist Alberto
(Woman of Rome) Moravia. Throughout the hearings the committee showed a disturbing fuzziness
over what it meant by "objectionable matter".
Since the committee itself could not decide, it
seemed dangerous to recommend that existing
federal laws be strengthened making it an offence
for private carriers to transport "lewd, obscene or
lascivious" books and magazines in interstate commerce. This could mean that a motorist might be
arrested for carrying a book by Steinbeck. However, publishers and readers alike could agree with
the committee's suggestion that the publishing
industry try to clean out the dirty corners in its
own house.

Hon. Mr. Davis: No opinion on that point
was expressed in the report.
Hon. Mr. Davies: I am satisfied with the
report, and I think it is a very good one. There
is only one part of the report about which I
was going to ask a question, and I shall ask it
now. The report of the committee reads in
part as follows:
Pending a decision of the Supreme Court of
Canada, the Justice Department proposes not in
any way to alter the present section 207, but if
it is necessary that "207" be revised as soon as
the facts of the situation are presented by a final
Court decision, this effort will be forthwith undertaken.

I should just like to be sure that that section
of the Criminal Code would not be revised
without the permission of parliament.
Hon. Mr. Davis: I think that it could only

Paper calls for consideration of the report.
Two honourable senators have spoken of
censorship. I raise this as a point of order,
and would ask honourable senators to come
back to consideration of the report itself.
Hon. Mr. Davies: I am sorry if I have transgressed, Mr. Speaker and honourable senators. I have nothing more to say about
censorship, in any event. I wanted to say,
however, that the brief of the Ontario Federation of the Home and School Club Association was a very good one. This organization
had made a survey of reading matter, and it
suggested that positive action might be taken
to cure the evils with which the committee
has been dealing.
If I might be permitted, I should like to
mention that a gloomy picture was presented to the committee on a number of
former occasions, and I thought that it would
be permissible for me to discuss, in rather a
broad way, not only the actual wording of
the report, but the submissions on which
the committee reported. Surely one should
be allowed to make some comments, for
otherwise there could be no -possible rebuttal
to some of the suggestions and comments
made by the delegations and witnesses before
the committee.
However, if I transgress
again I am quite willing to be stopped by his
Honour the Speaker or any honourable senator.
I am coming now to what I felt I should
say with regard to the report. There is a
brighter side to this picture, and one which
perhaps was presented to the committee by
some of the people who came before it. It
seemed to me that if the danger were as
great as indicated we should see some evidence of it in an increase in juvenile delinquency. I wondered if such were the case.
I noticed in my own paper one day that
juvenile delinquency in the city of Kingston
was 50 per cent less than in 1951. That, I
thought, was a very bright side to the picture.
It did not look to me as if the young people
of Kingston were being greatly influenced
by bad books, magazines or anything else of
that kind. I know that a lot of this result is
due to the good work of the police, service
clubs, church organizations and others. I was
very happy to learn of it, and I thought I
would try to find out what the position was
in other cities of comparable size in Ontario.
I cannot speak for the whole of Canada,
but if I am permitted I should like to tell
you that, so far as juvenile delinquency is
concerned, there has been no alarming
increase. In Waterloo County, which has a
population of 126,123, the number of juveniles
convicted for delinquency in 1951 was

seventy. In 1952 it had dropped to fifty-five.
In Welland County, in 1951, there were
twenty-three convictions for juvenile delinquency, and in 1952 there were thirty-six.
In the city of Stratford, a city of, I think,
about 25,000, twenty-one juveniles were
brought before the court in 1951-of whom
six were committed to a training school. In
1952 only five juveniles were brought before
the court, and but two of these were conmitted. While no doubt many cases did not
reach the court, I do feel that this is a very
encouraging picture. In the city of Brantford,
a city of 40,000, nineteen cases were brought
before the court in 1951.
Sixteen were
cases of theft. None of them had anything
to do with sex.
The figures for the city of St. Catharines
and the county of Lincoln are very interesting. St. Catharines must be a city of
about 50,000. I do not know the population
of the county of Lincoln, but I expect it is
about the sane as that of Waterloo. The
total number of juveniles dealt with from the
city and county during 1952 was 203. Only two
of these had any relation to sex: they were
confined to one township, and the two juveniles were charged with gross indecency.
The Hon. the Speaker: May I ask the honourable senator if this is connected with the
consideration of the report? If he feels it is
I would ask him to cite the part of the report
to which he is referring. I fail to see how
those statistics from various cities in Ontario
can support or detract from the report.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Your Honour, perhaps
I am mistaken. I was trying to lead up to
some suggestion that I desire to make in
connection with the report; but I am quite
willing, if your Honour rules, to leave it.
I was trying to point out that there was no
increase in either juvenile delinquency or
illegitimacy, although one would naturally
expect there would be if the books conplained of so bitterly by some witnesses had
the effect they said. If I may confine myself
only to the report and not go outside the
words of the report, I am afraid I shall be
much restricted.
The Hon. the Speaker: It is the report that
is under consideration.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Your Honour, is it permissible for me to suggest that if the committee
is reappointed next session, one or two things
which I think it mightThe Hon. the Speaker: When a motion for
reappointment of the committee is made, that
will be the time to bring up the matter.
Hon. Mr. Davies: We are discussing a
report presented by a committee appointed

The world does not change much, honourable senators, but I feel that when it does
change it changes for the better. Canada is
going ahead. Today it is, as we all know, the
greatest country in the world. No other

country can offer the same opportunities to
young men and women. I feel sure our young
men and women realize this, and I am confident that despite all the cheap, sexy books

they will respond to the better influences of
our national life and prepare themselves for

MOTION FOR THIRD READINGDEBATE ADJOURNED

The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I move the third reading now.
Hon. Arthur Marcotte: Honourable senators,
in amendment I move, seconded by the
honourable senator from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid):
That the bill be not now read the third time, but
that it be amended as follows:
Page 2, line 25: After the word "Parliament",
insert the following words: "but saving all rights
and privileges of either House in respect of the
control or removal of its officers, clerks and

employees".
Honourable senators, this amendment follows the remarks I made yesterday on the bill.
I am sure you will agree once more not only
with me but with my leader (Hon. Mr. Haig),

For better ensuring efficiency and economy in
the Civil Service of Canada, it is expedient to
provide for the retirement therefrom, on equitable
terms, of persons, who, from age or infirmity cannot properly perform the duties assigned ta them".

Section 9 of that act made the act apply ta:
the permanent officers and servants of the Senate
and louse of Commons; who, for the purposes of
this act shall be held to be in the Civil Service
of Canada, saving always all legal rights and
privileges of either house, as respects the appointment or removal of its officers and servants, or any
of them.

Honourable

senators,

parliaments

were

evolved in order te counteract the authority
of kings who abused their powers. And ever
since 1870, as I have shown, the Senate and
House of Commons of Canada have had the
privilege and right te counteract abuses by
the crown in so far as control over officers
and servants of parliament is concerned. That
control has always been in parliament, but
now for the first time it is proposed to take
it away and transfer it te the cabinet. The
purpose of my amendment is simply to have
the control restored to parliament.

SENATE
Yesterday the honourable senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) said that
important legislation has been brought into
the Senate in the dying hours of every
session since he has been a member of this
chamber-that is, for seventeen years. Well,
I have been here for almost twenty-two years,
and I make the same complaint. Actually
we are fortunate today in having a good attendance. I recall that one lime when I was on
the train ready to go West I was called back
to the Senate, to provide a quorum for a
sitting. Is a very small attendance during
the last days of a session fair to the public?
I do not think it is. I was very pleased with
the remark of the honourable senator from
Vancouver South that in future important
bills should be brought before us earlier.
Honourable senators, I have heard suggestions like that made for the past twenty years,
but we have never done anything to implement them. We are now close to the end of
another session, but let us, even at the last
minute, resolve to safeguard what is proper
and pertinent to our privileges and rights.
Surely, we are entitled to that. And surely
this house can insist upon maintenance of
its rights, even if only a few honourable senators are present.
What are we asking for in this amendment?
We are asking for preservation of the right
to manage our own affairs. It might be
said that such a right is certain and there
is no danger of its loss. I have in my hand
a document that was tabled by the honourable leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) about three years ago, being a
report of positions that were excluded by
order in council from the operation of the
Civil Service Act. The report was made to
parliament as required by section 59 of the
Civil Service Act, chapter 22 of the Revised
Statutes of Canada, 1927. Do honourable
senators know how many orders in council
were passed during the year covered by
the report? I did not count them all but the
total is not merely in the hundreds-it goes
into the thousands. Are we to be subjected
to that kind of authority? Surely we are
going to retain control over our own staff.
We have never yet been deprived of that
control.
I am not opposed to retirement at 65 years
of age. It will be recalled that a few years
ago an honourable senator presented a bill
in which the age of 65 was mentioned as the
retirement age. I said then, as I have always
said, that a man who is working with his
brains-I am not speaking of the man who
delivers mail or works with a shovel-is
better at 65 years of age than he ever was
in his earlier years. Support for my remarks
was found in the fact that of the twenty-eight

senators who were in the chamber when I
spoke three were slightly under 70 and the
remainder were past that age. Those members worked until the last minute of the
session; they bore the burden and the heat
of the day. A man's activities and usefulness
do not end when he reaches the age of
sixty-five, nor when he is seventy. You
will remember what an honourable senator
said the other day in tribute to Sir Winston
Churchill. You know as well as I do, honourable senators, that older men than we are
still actively engaged in their professions. The
man who has probably the best legal brain
in this country is past 70, and I contend that
he is an abler lawyer now than he ever was
before.
With all the work we have to do, we are
the ones who should decide whether any one
of our employees should retire at 65 years of
age. If because of illness a man is unable
to do his job properly, he should be the first
to ask to be relieved of his duties, in order
not to abuse his privileges. But I say most
emphatically that he should not be under
compulsion from the government to retire.
As I read through the bulky document produced by the honourable leader of the government three years ago, I asked myself why
was the Civil Service Commission created.
The purpose was, of course, to avoid patronage. It may surprise honourable senators
when I say that in a sense I am in favour of
patronage. I think that when a government
comes into power it should compensate those
to whom compensation is due, without being
unfair or doing an injustice to anyone. But
the Civil Service Commission was created
for the further purpose of guarding against
abuses by the government, and the Senate
and the House of Commons have always preserved their rights to decide when their
employees should retire.
I am not talking directly to the bill before
us, for in a few hours I cannot digest what
has taken experts many months to prepare.
My honourable leader on this side (Hon. Mr.
Haig) made a suggestion, which was supported by some of my colleagues, that this
measure should go over to next session. If
that is done, I for one shall do all I can
to assist parliament to pass a measure that
is the best possible for both the public service
and the country generally.
Passage of the bill before us today would
take away from this house rights that it has

honourable senators that history has proven
that once a right is lost it is never regained.
The tendency of the government through this
post-war period has been to grasp for itself
every power it could. I will not embarrass

MAY 6, 1953
anyone by speaking politically, but we all
know what bas happened in some quarters.
Before concluding my remarks I should
like to draw attention to the fact that for the
first time, at least in my mernory, a member
of the opposition is Acting Speaker of the
house. I congratulate my honourable friend
from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), who has
been selected for this distinction. As we
all know, the honourable the Acting Speaker
has presided for many years over the hearings of the Divorce Committee. I hope that
in performing the duties -of the high office
which he holds today he will see to it that
we are not divorced from some of our rights
by the passage of this bill.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators, I
make no apology for seconding the amendment moved by the honourable senator from
Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte). I support it
wholeheartedly.
The practice in this house has been for
the chairman of a committee, when he presents his report, to explain any contentious
points that were not unanimously agreed to
in the committee. I must say I am surprised that not a word of explanation has
been offered for the omission of two lines
from this important bill which comes to us
in the dying days of the session, when only
half of our total membership is in attendance. But some people seem to think that
anything can be done here.
I was interested to hear my honourable
colleague from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) say yesterday that he would support
the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) if he took a stand early next session
opposing the sending of . contentious legislation from the House of Commons to the
Senate a few days before the session is
expected to end. I too would like to join
that hearty band. The government and the
House of Commons must be brought to
realize that they are responsible for what is
happening. Living as they are in the days
of the past, they forget that parliament is
conducting a five-billion-dollar business.
Instead of discussing legislation, honourable
members of the House of Commons spend
three or four weeks on the Speech from the
Throne, making addresses which they hope
will get them re-elected to parliament, but
which their constituents have forgotten before
the members return home. I am well aware
that if I took a stand protesting against the
high-handed action of the Commons, the
quiet voices that call the faithful would soon
start whispering and I would be greatly outnumbered.
68112-39

I would remind honourable senators that
this most important bill, if it passes, will
affect 129,000 civil servants. Se I protest
against its hasty consideration as strongly as
I can.
While I expect this amendment will be
voted down, I repeat my question: Why were
these two lines omitted from the bill:
but saving all rights and privileges of either bouse
in respect of the controi or removal of its officers,
clerks and employees.

This honourable chamber is entitled to an
explanation of the omission, which infringes
on the rights of both houses of parliament.
I admit that my remarks of the other day
with respect te the amount of $189 million
were not clear. Let me point out now that last
year was a high year in the matter of payments by members of the Civil Service into
the superannuation fund. Had the government matched the $13 million contributed
by the employees, there would have been
a further $26 million credit towards the fund.
Instead, there was about $15 million.
I should like to see the system of payments
gone into more fully, because it may well be
that, had the government contributed dollar
for dollar and the fund been equalized according to the actuarial suggestion, there would
have stood to the credit of the fund, not a
usable reserve, but what I might describe as
a "back" support in an amount of three or
four hundred million dollars, with conditions
somewhat similar to those in the unemployment insurance fund. That fund, as we have
seen, amounts to about $800 million, and
on the strength of this accumulation the minister is increasing the benefits to those
entitled to unemployment insurance pay. It
may well be that, were there a fund of three
or four hundred million dollars to the credit
of the Civil Service, and with contributions
of only fifteen or sixteen million dollars being
required, the benefits could be increased.
But I am still mystified as to why all these
millions are necessary when in 1952 no more
than $1,425,000 was needed in the form of a
government contribution. The truth is, this
plan has been operating with hardly a dollar
of aid from the federal treasury. I do not
think honourable senators have grasped that
fact. The amount of money paid in by civil
servants under the act fell short by only
$1,425,000 of meeting all the outgoings by
way of payments to pensioners.
If the bill is to be further inquired into, I
should like to have some additional explanation from the chairman or acting chairman of
the Banking and Commerce Committee. I
am particularly interested to know why the
two lines I have quoted have been left out.
If the powers of the Senate and the House

SENATE
of Commons are not to be restricted, why
were these words deleted? Can it be said that
our rights are preserved in the bill when the
two lines, which I am going to read again,
have been deleted:
but saving all rights and privileges of either bouse
in respect of the control or removal of its officers,
clerks and employees.

I shall not detain the Senate any longer,
but I must again express my surprise that
this bill was presented and proceeded with,

without an explanation of any kind to the
Senate of the omission of these words from
the bill.
Hon. Wishart McL. Roberison: Honourable
senators, I am at some disadvantage in dealing with this important matter. I did not
know until the honourable senator from Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte) introduced his
amendment that it had been prepared; otherwise, in my official capacity I would have put
myself in a position to deal more adequately
with the subject-matter. When the bill came
up for second reading, it was, I understand,
very clearly explained by the honourable
senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell).
Yesterday, when the matter was under further
discussion, several honourable senators asked
important questions with regard to the bill,
which indicated to me the desirability of
a full explanation.
On the general question, why this bill came
before us so late in the session, I can give
only a general answer, to the effect that there
is always some legislation to be dealt with
in the last days of a session.
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon:

And there always

will be.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: At least, there always
has been since I have been a member of this
body.
I endeavoured to have every item of legislation which could be initiated in the Senate
introduced here early in the session. A number of important bills-some of them very
important-were brought in, and we handled
them with our customary expedition, and
almost worked ourselves out of a job in the
process.
Yesterday this bill was referred to the
Banking and Commerce Committee. So
impressed was I with the necessity of having
all possible information available to the
committee that I suggested there was no
reason why the committee could not go to
work on it at once, and that if it did so, ample
time remained to allow days for consideration. That was the best I could do. The house
concurred in the suggestion, and when the
committee met last evening I was able to

have available for them a whole array of
witnesses, headed by the Deputy Minister of
Finance. I also undertook that if, as I anticipated, the committee's examination might
last some days, the minister responsible for
the legislation would be in attendance. I
myself attended the meeting last evening
for the purpose of hearing what the witnesses
had to say in respect of some questions
which have been raised here, and among
other senators present I noticed the honourable member from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr.
Vien), who had expressed some doubts conI hope that the
cerning the legislation.
honourable senator from Ponteix (Hon. Mr.
Marcotte) and the honourable senator from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) were also
there. As I recollect, everybody asked questions, and very clear explanations were given
with regard to all the matters inquired into.
Whether the honourable senators from Ponteix and New Westminster were there, I do
not know; I was late, and they might have
left before I came in.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I was not present.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Well, the opportunity
was there. As I have said, a great many
questions were asked, covering the financial
aspects of the bill, including the origin and
extent of the deficit and how it was to be
met. The concensus of opinion seemed to be
that the provision for this purpose was a
business-like one and calculated to put the
fund on an actuarially sound basis.
There was a good deal of discussion regarding the rights and privileges of the Senate
in respect of its staff, and the conclusion of
everyone present was that in no way, shape
or form were those rights and privileges
interfered with. I regret very much that the
keen, analytical mind of the honourable
member from Ponteix was not available to
us, and that we had not the benefit of the
presence of the honourable senator from
New Westminster.
Hon. Mr. Reid: When I have a chance to
speak I will explain why I was not there.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: In any event, as I
have pointed out, the opportunity was open.
As I understand it, the right of the Senate to
retain the services of an official after the age
of sixty-five is not in question. We can retain
them if we wish. The point is that his pension rights would cease growing at sixty-five,
and therefore in the years following he would
not make any contribution to the fund. My
honourable friend from De Lorimier (Hon.
Mr. Vien) shakes his head. Perhaps he is
more familiar with the legislation than I am.

MAY 6, 1953
I am at a disadvantage because I did not
hear the original discussion, and I am really
not prepared to speak at this time. There
was a great deal of discussion in committee
about this legislation, and those present drew
certain conclusions. First of all, the legislation is beneficial because it extends pension
rights to employees in a temporary classification. They will now be able to contribute to
a superannuation fund from which they will
draw on retirement. An explanation was
given of the cause of the original deficit,
and what action has been taken to put the
fund on a sound actuarial basis. Provision
bas been made to review the financial set-up
every five years to ensure that the scheme
is actuarially sound. Honourable senators
were also assured that the legislation in no
way prejudices the privileges of Senate in
regard to its personnel. If I am wrong in this
summation, those who have followed the passage of this bill more closely .can correct me.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
may I make a suggestion? I am rather concerned about the amendment now before the
house. It is easy to make general statements
to the effect that this amendment will not
affect the Senate, but I am not sure that that
is so. In view of the fact that this amendment
was introduced without notice to the leader
of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson), I
would suggest that the leader adjourn the
debate so that he may speak on this question
with more authority tomorrow. I hope we
shall have a full explanation of it.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
should like to speak before the honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) adjourns the
debate. I was present in this chamber during
the entire debate on the second reading of this
bill, and I also attended the committee meeting where I asked many questions of the
officials of the commission. I have always
admired the ability of the distinguished senators from Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte) and
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid). They have
inquiring minds and are the type of member
we need in the Senate. These gentlemen are
determined that the rights of parliament shall
not be interfered with by any bureaucracy,
and I fully agree with them.
I am not going to argue the pros and cons
of the amendment now before the house, but
I want to review two or three features of the
bill. First, did those who drew up this legislation believe it would interfere with the
rights of parliament? Second, how have the
moneys been raised and what are the reserves
in the fund at the present time? Third, what
are the provisions which deal with so-called
temporary employees in the Civil Service?
I have always felt kindly towards these
68112-39J

employees, some of whom have served for as
long as twenty or twenty-five years in a
temporary capacity. I must admit I have not
shown much concern as to whether this legislation would interfere with the rights of the
Senate and House of Commons. Perhaps I
should have given more attention to this
aspect of the legislation, but I have been more
interested in knowing just what additional
benefits will be forthcoming to our civil servants generally. If this bill becomes law,
every employee of the government service in
Canada will have the right to annuity
benefits.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Only those who are
employed on a regular basis.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes; I am not referring
to persons employed for a week or two.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: For instance, fruit and
vegetable inspectors will not qualify.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I know, but they are a
small minority. The point is that temporary
employees, who have never been eligible to
receive a pension, will come under the act if
they comply otherwise with its provisions.
Retirement is compulsory under the present
act, and no contributor may be retained in
the Civil Service beyond sixty-five years of
age, except where the governor in council, for
reasons of exceptional efficiency and fitness,
grants annual extensions up to the age of
seventy. This bill does not specify an obligatory retirement age but gives the governor
in council power to make regulations with.
respect to termination of employment. If an
employee is granted an extension of service
after he has attained the age of sixty-five, he
will not be able to draw his pension until
that additional term of service is completed.
Here is another point. A young man
at present employed in the Senate on a fiveyear probationary period does not contribute
to any Civil Service pension plan, and of
course if he leaves his employment before
the end of that period he is not entitled to
superannuation benefits. Under the proposed
legislation he would begin to contribute to a
pension the moment he accepted employment
in the Senate. It is important to bear in
mind that the Senate will not be deprived
of the right to appoint its officials and
employees.
Under the proposed act an employee's pension will be 2 per cent of his average salary
for the best ten years of his employment,
multiplied by the total number of years of
service, not exceeding thirty-five. Supposing
a young woman is employed by the Senate
as an accountant at an annual salary of
$2,500 and, having worked at this job for
ten years, decides that it is too arduous and

SENATE
accepts other employment in the government
service at $2,000 a year. When she retires
she will be entitled to compute her pension
on the best ten years of her employment.
Under the proposed act contributions to be
made by those wishing to participate in the
pension scheme will amount to 6 per cent of
the salary for males and 5 per cent for
females, and the government will match these
zontributions.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Was any explanation given
in committee as to why the rate was raised
from 52 per cent to 6 per cent in the case
of civil servants in the lower income
brackets?
Hon. Mr. Haig: The answer is very simple.
As near as the committee could find from
the actuarial statement of 1947, it would
require 5 per cent from women and 6 per
cent from men, and equivalent contributions
from the government. But payments on that
scale will not make the fund actuarially
sound. The amount that should be paid in
is 5 per cent for women-that is 10 per
cent, when the government's contribution is
included-and 121 per cent for men. That
leaves a shortage of about one-half -of one
per cent, but that will be caught up when
the next five years' examination of the table
is made. If the shortage continues, slightly
larger payments will bave to be made.
Now, as to the fund, there is no money in
it. Under the act there is a direct liability
of the dominion government to pay the
superannuation.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Why are those millions
required?
Hon. Mr. Haig: In 1917 the actuarial tables
disclosed an estimated shortage of $364 million. I think the government has since paid
in $175 million; and on the last estimate it
now owes $189 million. It has agreed to pay
4 per cent of that amount into the fund.
Under the new law it is compulsory for the
government to put up dollar for dollar with
the civil servants.
At the meeting of the committee the chairman (Hon. Mr. Hayden) raised a point, which
I supported. The government auditors have
prepared a statement showing that the government owes the fund $189 million, and
this is shown as a deferred liability. I would
have liked to have an order in council or an
order from the Treasury Board admitting that
liability. However, I was prepared to accept
the statement, which was only in the form
of a memorandum, because it was all that
was available at the time.
My honourable friend from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden) bas asked whether the pensions

of certain classes could be raised. I am convinced that this act makes the federal treasury liable for its half -of the total contribution to the fund, and that this is a liability
that the government is supposed to meet
every year. It is also supposed to pay yearly
a portion of the $189 million. I think that
is all to the good. The contributions of
every employee to the fund will be doubled,
because the government will pay an equal
amount into the fund.
Probably the sponsors of the legislation
were not sure that it was an ideal plan, but
it is a very great improvement over the
present one. I am convinced that it would
be very unfair to government employees if
we did not pass this bill. I say that for two
reasons: (1) it makes the government liable;
there is no question about that; (2) it makes
all temporary employees pensionable. The
fact that the government has a direct liability
to contribute would encourage people who
have not been paying into the fund through
the years to become full-scale contributors.
Some temporary employees have not been
paying the full percentage into the fund; they
have paid some money into another fund,
and this will help them-though in itself it
will not be sufficient-to catch up with their
arrears in the superannuation fund. They
will be given the privilege of turning that
money over to this fund in annual
instalments.
Mr. Taylor, the Deputy Minister of Finance,
was present at the committee meeting, and
I do not believe I was ever more favourably
impressed by any deputy minister. During
the last war he was in the government service, but not a contributor to the superannuation fund, and be told us that when he was
appointed Deputy Minister he had to pay
a substantial sum into the fund to cover the
period of his former service. My honourable
friend from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) asked
him, among other pertinent questions, whether
this plan was more beneficial to the lowerincome group than to the higher-income group.
Mr. Taylor said it was more favourable to
the lower-income group. That view is the
more interesting because of his being in one
of the higher-income brackets, and I think
we can accept it. I was convinced by him
and his associates at the meeting last night
that this proposed legislation is a tremendous
advance for the Civil Service of Canada. I
am also convinced that there will be no interference at all with our powers of appointment.
Hon. Mr. Farris: What about this amendment?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am not sure what it
means. Both houses will have all the powers
that they can have.

MAY S, 1953
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Why drop those words
out of the act?
Hon. Mr. Haig: To be quite frank, I
gathered from the questions put by the
honourable senator from De Lorimier (Hon.
Mr. Vien), and the answers that he received,
that the present bill puts retirement on a
basis completely different from what it has
ever been on before; that the government will
pass regulations applicable to all civil servants. There might be some question as to
whether there is cause to be afraid that the
Civil Service Commission will interfere with
the rights and privileges of the Senate, but I
am persuaded that there is not. That is my
honest opinion.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Do you think it would
do any harm to have those words in the act?
Hon. Mr. Haig: They might not do any harm.
I have never been in favour of including
words in legislation without knowing what
their effect is likely to be. I think the proposed new act will do all that we want it to
do. My off-hand opinion is that the words
would not do much harm; but I think the
bill is such an advance in legislation that I
would not want to change it. It seems to me
that it does protect the Senate and the House
of Commons in every respect, and takes nothing away from them. I do not believe the
other words would help one iota. However,
there are better lawyers here than I who can
pass on that. I see here at the moment, for
instance, the honourable learned senators
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden), from De
Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien), from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen), from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck), from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Campbell), from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris), and others. Their opinions would be
much better than mine. Mine is the "sidewalk" opinion.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I trust that the honourable
senator will allow us to protest against his
act of excessive humility.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not think the words
would add anything to the legislation. I feel
that in the interests of civil servants we
should pass this bill.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I agree with my honourable friend who bas
just spoken, that in general this is an excellent measure and that it will be for the benefit
of the Civil Service of this country. Personally, I should be very sorry to see anything
done in this chamber which would delay the
passage of the bill at the present session.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I listened to the discussion in the committee yesterday evening
and to our discussion here this afternoon.

Yesterday evening I was as convinced as was
my honourable friend the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) that there were
no provisions in the bill that might lead to
interference with the rights of the Senate
and the House of Commons with respect to
the control or removal of their officers, clerks
and employees. But I must say, honourable
senators, that having looked again at the
bill and at some of the relevant sections to
which I shall direct your attention in a
moment, I have some little doubt about it.
I would not have raised the question, but
the amendment that we have now before us
raises it.
May I draw the attention of the house to
the relevant sections? In section 2, which
is the interpretation section, "contributor"
is defined as:
...
a person required by subsection (1) of section
4 to contribute to the superannuation account ...

Turning to subsection (1) of section 4 we
find that every person employed in the Public
Service-certain categories are excepted
which do not affect us-is required to contribute to the superannuation account. Paragraph (j) of section 2 (1), to which the
amendment is now directed, states that the
"Public Service" includes members of the
staff of the Senate, the House of Commons
and Library of Parliament. They are contributors to the account, and therefore are
members of the Public Service.
I turn now to section 30, which empowers
the governor in council to make regulations.
Looking particularly at paragraph (ad), I find
that the governor in council may make regulations,notwithstanding any other act of the Parliament
of Canada, providing that, upon attaining such age
as is fixed by the regulations, a contributor shall
cease to be employed in the Public Service unless
his continued employment therein is authorized in
accordance with such regulations ...

There seems to me to be some question
whether the governor in council could not
use his powers to make regulations which
would override a decision of the Senate or
House of Commons to continue a superannuated employee in his position. It would be
possible for the governor in council, notwithstanding any other act of parliament, to
prescribe by regulation that an employee of
the Senate or House of Commons, having
reached the age of sixty-five or sixty-six
years, or whatever age was prescribed, shall
in the words of this paragraph, "cease to be
employed in the public service".
There may be other sections in the bill
which nullify what I have just said. The
problem stems from the difficulty to which a
number of honourable senators have referred
in the course of this discussion-that of the
late period in which the bill comes before us.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Would that not be one of
the reasons for the amendment?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Probably it would. The
difficulty would be cured, I should assume, by
passage of the amendment; but of that I am
not too sure. I should like to support the
suggestion of the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) that
under these circumstances the debate be
adjourned for a day, and that we seek the
advice of our Law Clerk and some of the
eminent counsel who are members of this
house in order to get some direction whether
this amendment is necessary.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I direct a question to
the honourable senator? Does he not think
that if the two lines in question, which appear
in the act, were inserted in the bill, any
doubt as to the question now raised would be
removed?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I should assume so, but
I should not like to say off hand.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Suppose the new legislation specifically stated that the age of retirement would remain at sixty-five years, would
that not meet the objection raised by the
honourable senator? The bill contains no age
limit.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: No.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: If an age limit were
stated, and the matter of extension were left
to the governor in council, would that not
meet the objection?
Hon. Mr. Euler: That is the way the act
operates now.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I mentioned yesterday
that I thought the fundamental purpose of this
legislation was to avoid the exercise of discretionary powers on the part of, for instance,
the Treasury Board, or anybody else, and to
impose stricter adherence to the law. There
have been a number of cases of persons having
been retained in their employment beyond the
age of sixty-five in contravention of the act.
It is my opinion that the proposed legislation
is designed to meet objections to such a practice. For example, under the Income War
Tax Act the effect of discretionary powers
placed in the hands of the minister was to
practically nullify the law in that connection,
and a new act had to be brought in. I think
the same principle has been applied in this
case.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Honourable senators, I
listened attentively to the discussion on this
subject yesterday afternoon and I attended
the committee last evening, but I have not
heard all the debate thus far this afternoon.
In a word, it seems to me that a pension
plan which does not make retirement obliga-

tory is defective. A man who has been retired
at the regular age can, if it is desirable, be
rehired, but he must conform with the general
rule as to retirement age.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I wish to thank the honourable leader of
the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) for his excellent explanation of the Civil Service Superannuation Act. Of course the content of that
act is not involved in the amendment before
the house.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I admit that.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Although I have listened
carefully to the debate, I have not given this
bill the attention it deserves. True, there
are grounds for complaint when legislation
comes to us in the last days of the session.
But, honourable senators, we have the matter
in our own hands: nobody can compel us to
pass a bill until we are ready to pass iit; all
we need is the courage to stay here and do
our job, and let the Commons wait for us.
This bill has been in our hands for only a
very few days, and I confess that I have not
surrounded myself with ail the details of the
act. I have, however, listened closely to the
debate on this amendment and so far I have
heard no reason given for dropping from the
bill the words which are said, to be in the act.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Were I at this moment
required to vote on the bill, I would not take
the responsibility for the omission of those
words. That is to say, I support the amendment to insert them in the new legislation,
and I would so vote.
As I have said, I am not satisfied with the
explanation of the bill nor with my own
study of it. Although because of other commitments it will be impossible for me to be
in the house tomorrow, I propose to move
the adjournment of the debate and to suggest
that the honourable leader, with the unanimous consent of the house, be allowed to
study the bill further and tell us why the
lines in question were left out. The proposed
amendment has come before us without
notice, but the rules of the house permit this.
None of us has studied it. I have never seen
the text, though I have heard it read, and I
am not sure in what part of the bill it is
proposed to insert it. In consequence, I move
the adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The committee's
report was presented to the house by the
acting chairman of the Banking and Commerce Committee (Hon. Mr. Lambert) in the
absence of the chairman (Hon. Mr. H.ayden),
who since then has arrived here. He is fully
conversant with the details of the bill. I do

MAY 6, 1953
not oppose the motion to adjourn the debate,
for I am not in a position lat this time to
explain why the lines referred to are not in
the bill. Al I can state is, that as far as I
can ascertain there is no intention to deprive
the Senate of any of its rights and privileges.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Will the honourable government leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) permit
me to ask, if that was not the intention, why
were the words left out?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I have already said
that I am not in a position to answer that
question, and I have indicated my agreement
with the motion of the honourable senator
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck).
I had hoped that the matter would have been
clarified in committee last evening, but
apparently it was not.
Hon. Mr. Vien: The honourable government leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) will recall
that in the committee last night I put a
question on this point to the Deputy Minister
of Finance, and he told me that what was
done was not on his recommendation; but
beyond that he could give no information.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I did not hear that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I am quite satisfied to
withdraw the motion, but I would be better
satisfied if the whip would adjourn the
debate after the present discussion is completed. I do not want to shut off anybody
at the moment, but neither do I want the
matter closed today. I should like to be
able to look into it, with a view to deciding
how I should vote.
Hon. Salier A. Hayden: Honourable senators, I do not think any person can object
to the request of the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) for a
delay for the purpose of getting all the
information possible as to the meaning of the
legislation, and what would be the effect of
the proposed amendment. What I shall say
is simply to convey my own viewpoint and
my own opinion.
Under the law as it stands, the Senate
would have control over the retirement of its
own employees. Under the bill, and particularly that subsection at the foot of page
35 which was referred to, provision is made
for the enactment of regulations, one of
which, I assume, may provide that on or after
a date or 'an age to be specified, any person
subject to the superannuation plan shall
cease to be in the Public Service. The net
effect is to transfer from the Senate, in the
one case, and from the Commons, in the
other, control over the retirement dates of

employees in each of those places, and have
the matter regulated under the superannuation plan. That was explained in a general
sort of way last night; and I recall putting
the question "Is there an infringement on
any real right the Senate at present enjoys;
or, shall we, as a result of this change, lose
anything which is worth a struggle to
retain?" My view was, and still is, that
there is no such infringement, and no such
loss. Looking at the question from a serious,
sane, realistic point of view, to require that
the retirement of employees of the Senate
under the superannuation plan shall be
governed by regulations enacted under this
bill rather than by the will of the Senate,
or the Commons, as the case may be, does
not infringe upon or remove any right which
really matters. To my mind it is of little
consequence. As far as the employee is concerned, he acquires benefits under the plan,
and to make the plan effective there must be
some provision for a retirement date. Nothing in this bill would prevent the Senate from
re-employing on a temporary basis a person
who had been so retired, the day after his
retirement. All that is provided in this connection is that under this plan, and for the
purposes of this plan, if the regulations enact
a retirement age of sixty-five, the employee,
whether he be on the staff of the Department
of Finance or the staff of the Senate, ceases
at that age to remain in the Public Service.
I said yesterday, and I repeat, that I am just
as jealous of the rights of the Senate as anyone else, and as much opposed to the surrender of any right that is of real importance,
but I do not regard surrender of Senate
jurisdiction over the retirement of its
employees as weakening by one iota the
dignities and powers of this body.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Did the honourable senator
get a satisfactory explanation of the dropping
of the two lines in the act which preserve
the Senate's right over its employees?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The reason for dropping
them is quite apparent. It is sought to establish a uniform method of retirement, and
certainly you will get a uniform method of
retirement if regulations are enacted to provide for a retirement date on and after which
an employee ceases to remain in the public
service. The intention is to have a regulation
of general application as regards the retirement age.
Hon. Mr. Reid: And that is a loss of power
of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Supposing the amendment
is carried and we retain the right to determine how long an employee will stay, is that
compatible with a proper pension scheme?

SENATE

If, for instance, the government decided that
everybody should retire at the age of sixtyseven or sixty-eight, this bouse might say,
"No, we are going to keep our people until
they are seventy, or perhaps seventy-five, as
we may see fit". Could a pension scheme
provide for variations of that kind?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I will answer these two
questions. The honourable senator from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) states that the
Senate is threatened with the loss of one of
its powers. My reply is that certainly it
involves the giving up of something we now
possess, but whether that loss of power is
material is the point which concerns me; and
examining it as best I can, I cannot see that
the concession we are called upon to make
under this head can in any sense be described
as material.
As for the question of the honourable senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig): there are
provisions in the bill which fix at thirty-five
the maximum number of years of contribution, so an employee who continues in the
service after having made thirty-five annual
contributions and has not reached retirement
age would have no further payments to make,
nor would there be any matching contributions. The converse of that is that if an
official arrived at the retirement age of sixtyfive before having made thirty-five annual
contributions, but was not then required to
retire, and this amendment were passed to
exempt the employees of the Senate from the
application of the regulations, he might
remain in the employ of the Senate after the
general retirement date to be prescribed
under the bill. What would happen to his
obligation to make contributions under the
plan I do not know. Under the plan he cannot
make contributions after he has reached the
age of retirement, nor can he make contributions after be has been in the service for
thirty-five years. I do not know what other
consequential or substantive amendments
would be required if we adopted the amendment of the honourable gentleman from Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte). We cannot merely
insert the amendment into the act and take it
for granted that we have not interfered with
the mechanics of the act itself. I do not
quarrel with my honourable colleague from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) when he
says that we should give this amendment our
full consideration, for if we pass the legislation without the amendment we might be
forfeiting certain of our rights. Before adopting this amendment, however, we should
certainly be advised of its implications and
how it may affect other provisions in the act.
The honourable leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) took the trouble to discuss

the phases of this plan as they were unfolded
to us in committee last night. During the
debate on the second reading of this bill I
said that the Civil Service superannuation
scheme should be devised in such a way that
the greatest possible benefits should go to
employees in the lower-income brackets,
because these people constitute the great
majority of civil servants who form the basis
of the day-to-day operations of the government. I asked certain questions along that
line in committee, and I got these important
answers.
First of all, I was told thait if the employee's
pension were calculated on the basis of the
best eight years of service rather than on the
best ten years, it would certainly result in a
greater benefit to those employed in the
higher-income brackets.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I was also informed that
an immediate benefit would undoubtedly go
to the lower-income group if the maximum
period of computable service were reduced
from thirty-five to thirty years. If an
employee's pension were computed on the
basis of thirty years' service and 75 per cent
of his average salary during his best ten
years of service, be would receive substantially more than be would if his pension
were based on thirty-five years' service and
70 per cent of the average of his best ten
years of service. Now, nowhere near threequarters of all civil servants retire with a
full complement of service, so the average
pension cannot be calculated on the basis of
what it would produce for thirty-five years of
service.
Mr. Taylor informed the committee that
at the present time the average going-out
salary of employees who have completed
thirty-five years service is approximately
$2,800.
Seventy per cent of this amount
would give the employee somewhere between
$1,900 and $2,000 on his retirement. However, many employees are not in the service
for thirty-five years, and Mr. Taylor was
prepared to place the overall average goingout salary at approximately $2,400. Well, 70
per cent of this amount would give the retired
employee a pension of appproximately $1,500
or $1,600, which is hardly a sufficient income
on which to live these days. While the plan
will provide some benefit to employees on
their retirement, it does not appear to be
geared to the present cost of living. I do not
know what could be done at the moment to
remedy this situation.
Mr. Humphries, one of the experts appearing before the committee, informed us that

MAY 6, 1953

the cost of operating the plan would be substantially increased if the length-of-service
requirement were reduced from thirty-five to
thirty years. Now, the moment you are faced
with that proposition you have to cry halt, for
it involves spending the contributions made
by employees as well as by the government.
This step would require careful consideration
and study, and is not something about which
I would suggest an amendment at this late
date. At this time I do not think we can
go any further than to bring this whole question to the attention of the government. It
may be that the only way employees in the
lower-income bracket could receive a more
adequate pension on retirement is to reduce
the length of service or increase salaries. But
I do not want to be quoted as advocating
increases in salaries at the present time. Too
many people are doing this now, and it would
seem that everyone has forgotten the old idea
of an employee attempting for a reasonable
length of time to give adequate service for
what he is being paid, and establishing that as
his basis for seeking a further increase. In
the circumstances, I think the bill goes as
far as one can reasonably expect at this time.
Honourable senators, if I were asked to vote
on'this amendment now I would have to vote
against it, but I am willing to hear further information as to what its scope and effect might
be, and reserve my final decision until later.
Hon. Mr. Farris: My honourable friend said
that the Senate could immediateiy rehire a
person who had reached the age of retirement.
What effect would that have on the superannuation scheme?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: None whatsoever. If
a person continued in the employ of the public
service under any of the exceptions in the
bill he could not augment his pension while
continuing in his employment; but if he were
appointed after having been deprived of a
previous job by regulation or after having
been out of the Public Service, then he could
build up his pension. That is only my armchair opinion.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Taylor, the debate
was adjourned.

CANADA FAIR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES
BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck moved the second
reading of Bill 100., an Act to prevent discrimination in regard to employment and
membership in trade unions by reason of race,
national origin, colour or religion.
He said: Honourable senators, we have
passed many bills in this house-some this
session-that involved much greater expenditure than the bill now before us; for instance,
the supply bills. And we have passed more
important bills, among which I might particularly mention the bill to revise the
Criminal Code. But I submit that we have
not handled, at least during this session, a
more admirable or high-minded proposed
enactment than is to be found in Bill 100,
the purpose of which is to prevent discrimination in regard to employment and membership
in trade unions by reason of race, national
origin, colour or religion. In my judgment,
the bill is the inevitable outcome of the vast
amount of social security legislation and the
humanitarian policies of the present government. I think this bill is the culmination of a
long series of thoughts and considerations
which may be traced back to the early days
when the late Prime Minister Mackenzie King
was a young man in the Department of
Labour, protesting against abuses and espousing the cause of crippled girls in match factories, and struggling as best he could for
improved labour relations.
The purpose of the bill is to secure equality
of opportunity in employment for all our
citizens without discrimination by reason of
race, national origin, colour or religion. That
is a grand conception. In breadth of conception this is the finest bill, in my judgment, that
we have had the privilege of discussing this
session. Among bills, it is the premier in
that regard; or, to paraphrase the words of
Shakespeare in referring to Marc Antony,
"This is the noblest Roman of them all."
Fair employment practices laws are modern,
but not by any means new. In 1945 the state
of New York pioneered in legislation of this
kind. At that time it enacted that no person
should be denied the right to earn a living
because of religious beliefs, or racial or
national background, and it provided penalties for acts of discrimination by employers,
by employees when gathered in labour organizations, or by the agents of either of these
classes, or by individuals.
I should like to read from the report for the
year 1952 of the New York Commission
charged with the administration of that act,

598

SENATE

a measure quite similar to the one before us.
The commissioners say:

re-examine ourselves and work out a solution as
quickly as possible.

The New York State law against discrimination
which started out in July 1945 as an experiment
in enlightened social legislation may now be
assessed, almost eight years later, as an essential
statutory device in eradicating those practices of
discrimination which not only deny individual interests and incentives, rights and privileges, but retard
the growth of our economy by the squandering of
our manpower resources. Such practices can never
be justified in a democratic society.

In 1950 the Senate of Canada appointed a
committee to consider and report on human
rights and fundamental freedoms. I now
quote from its report, which was unanimously
adopted by this house:

The New York law provides penalties; but

it is a rather interesting fact that, of the
2,500 cases which have been handled by these
commissioners in the last seven and a half

years, three cases only have come to trial.
That is, on three occasions only did the commissioners feel it necessary to resort to court
action. The explanation, of course, is in the
force and power of persuasion and education,
and also-and this should never be forgotten
-in the power of public opinion. These were
the effective weapons used by the New York
State commissioners during those past few
years to bring about a better recognition of
those human rights and fundamental freedoms that this Senate has advocated.
In its 1951 report the commission made
another statement which I should like to lay
before this house:
The commission realizes full well that problems
of employment discrimination which made a law
necessary have not been completely solved. It is
satisfied, however, that the law is no longer viewed
by the general public as an expedient, an experiment, or a controversial document, but as an
important instrument in the building of a stronger
democratic state.

The New York action which, as I have said,
pioneered this type of legislation has been
followed by ten other states of the union. I
think perhaps the most important example,
or the most outstanding one, is that of Ohio.
However, we do not have to go across the
line to look for such examples. We have not
been idle, by any means, in this matter of
bringing about the observance of fundamental
human rights. In 1948 the Canadian delegation to the general assembly of the United
Nations voted for the universal declaration
of human rights. That declaration, which was
adopted on the 10th of December 1948, contained this clause:
All human beings are born free and equal in
dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason
and conscience and should act towards one another
in a spirit of brotherhood.

It was at this time that Eleanor Roosevelt,

who was then the chairman of the United
Nations Human Rights Commission, uttered
these words, which have been quoted on a
number of occasions since:
Each account of discrimination, segregation or

lynching discredits us abroad. Racial discrimination is the weak spot in our democracy. We must

That every man, woman and child has rights is
generally accepted as axiomatic, and that such
rights should be protected is a conviction as universally held. Your committee agrees with this
view, holding that every human being, irrespective
of mere classifications on account of race, creed,
sex, caste or colour and other like distinctions, bas
rights which flow from his divine creation.

I have said that we in Canada have not
been idle, but have pioneered in this type of
legislation, philosophy and thought. Special
credit is due the legislature and the people
of the province of Ontario, from which I
come. In 1944 the Ontario legislature enacted
a law against disriminatory advertising. Honourable senators will remember the type of
advertising to which that enactment referred.
One advertisement which was carried fairly
widely used the words "No British need
apply". Such advertisements were banned
by the legislature.
In 1950 the Ontario legislature amended
the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act
to prevent racially restrictive covenants in
the conveyances of land. Honourable senators will remember the controversy with
respect to it, and the type of objectionable
and insulting provisions found in some covenants which raised miserable distinctions
between our citizens. Those restrictions are
no·longer binding in Ontario.
Finally-and for this too I give credit to
the province from which I come-the legislature passed the Fair Employment Practices law, the first of its kind in Canada. If
honourable senators will bear with me, I
shall read the preamble to that act:
Whereas it is contrary to public policy in
Ontario to discriminate against men and women in
respect of their employment because of race, creed,
colour, nationality, ancestry or place of origin;
Whereas it is desirable to enact a measure
designed to promote observance of this principle;
And whereas to do so is in accord with the universal declaration of right, as proclaimed by the
United Nations.

The act goes on te lay down the principles
of non-discrimination in the matter of employment of citizens irrespective of race, colour,

creed, and so on.
There is a Biblical quotation in, I believe,
the English Church Prayer Book, in these
words:
Let your light so shine before men that they
may sec your good works ...

It is well to remember that a good example
is just as effective as a bad example. The
example set by Ontario was followed in 1947

MAY 6, 1953
by Saskatchewan. Section 8 of a law passed
in that year by Saskatchewan reads as
follows:
Every person and every class of persons shail
enjoy the right to obtain and retain employment
without discrimination with respect to compensation, terms, conditions or privileges of employment
because of race, creed, religion, colour or ethnic
or national origin of such person or class of
persons.

Hon. Mr. Vien: Will the honourable senator permit me a question? I note that
"religion" is not defined in the bill.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Does it require a definition?
Hon. Mr. Vien: Suppose a communist comes
to me in search of employment and he says
he does not believe in God or the devil, but
that he believes in the teachings of Lenin
and Stalin. His religion is communism. Can
I exclude him on the grounds that I do not
want a communist in my institution?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I think that would be
irreligion, rather than religion.
Hon. Mr. Vien: But from his point of view
it would be religion.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I do not think he would
get very far if he attempted to prosecute you
on those grounds.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I am not too sure.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: At all events, attempts
have been made to define religion for at least
2,000, and perhaps, 5,000 years. For my part,
I am ready to excuse the draftsmen of the
bill for not attempting to define it here. Everyone knows what religion is, and the courts
or the minister would deal with the question
if it arose.
May I now direct my remarks for a moment
to the honourable leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig)? I hope he can give me some
information about an enactment that is
reported to have been passed on April 30,
1953, in the province of Manitoba, prohibiting
discrimination in the matter of employment on
the grounds of race, religion, creed or national
origin. I have been unable to find the details
of it, and I hope that he may enlighten me
on it now or later.
The dominion has also been busy in this
matter of legislating against objectionable
types of racial discrimination. On November
7, 1942, while the war was in progress, Mr.
Elliot Little, head of the National Selective
Service, issued Regulation No. 81 of the
Department of Labour. Although the whole
order is worth reading, I shall quote only one
paragraph:
Some employers continue to discriminate against
certain classes of persons on grounds of citizenship, race, language, name, creed or colour. Such
discrimination impairs the war effort.
68112-404

The order contains some further specific
instructions that no questiond are to be
asked in any circular or questionnaire with
regard to religion or racial origin and so on
in the employment of persons by that department.
In June, 1952, parliament amended the
Unemployment Insurance Act by providing:
It shall be the duty of the commission to ensure
that there shall be no discrimination in referring
to any worker seeking employment, subject to the
needs of the employment, either in favour of or
against any such worker by reason of his racial
origin, colour, religious belief or political affiliation.

Hon. Mr. Euler: I have not read the bill, but
I should like to ask my honourable friend
whether its provisions apply to newcomers
who are not yet citizens.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: They do. No distinction
is made between citizens and non-citizens,
and of course there should not be any: both
are legally resident in this country.
On September 24, 1952, the government of
this country passed Order in Council P.C.4133,
ensuring fair employment practices in government contracts. The preamble to the order
which became effective January 1, 1953, states:
. . . it is considered advisable that a clause prohibiting discrimination by the contractor In the
employment of labour in respect of race, national
origin, colour, or religion should be incorporated
in all contracts made by the Government of Canada
for construction, remodelling, repair or demolition of public buildings or other works, or for the
manufacture and supply of equipment, materials
and supplies.

That, I think, wa-s a simple and most highly
commendable amendment of the rules with
regard to government contracts.
I have sketched the development of this
psychology across the line, and in Ontario
and other provinces. Let me now turn to the
present bill and proceed to consider what is
happening in respect of dominion jurisdiction.
The bill, of course, is very much wider in its
provisions, and it is limited to federal
jurisdiction. Nevertheless it covers a fairly
wide field: I wish I knew how many people
are involved. Under dominion jurisdiction
will be included navigation and shipping,
railways, canals and telephones, with interprovincial telegraphs, air transportation,
radio, banks, and any works outside the
exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces; also,
such works and undertakings as are declared
by parliament to be for the general advantage
of Canada. The bill also covers not only persons directly employed by the government but
those employed by crown companies.
As regards its application, section 2 states:
"employer" means a person who employs five or
more employees.

SENATE
Those who employ fewer than five are so
numerous, and so difficult to follow up, that
administrative difficulties prompted this
limitation. Also excluded, by the way, are
domestic employment, which it is almost
impossible to regulate, and small employers
generally.
As regards the prohibitions, which of
course constitute the nub of the bill, section 4
has this to say:
(1) No employer shall refuse to employ or to
continue to employ, or otherwise discriminate
against any person in regard to employment or any
term or condition of employment because of his
race, national origin, colour or religion.
(2) No employer shall use, in the hiring or
recruitment of persons for employment, any
employment agency that discriminates against persons seeking employment because of their race,
national origin colour or religion.
(3) No trade union shall exclude any person
from full membership or expel or suspend or otherwise discriminate against any of its members or
discriminate against any person in regard to his
employment by any employer, because of that
person's race, national origin, colour or religion.

or assisted in any way in respect of the initiation
or prosecution of a complaint or other proceeding
under this act.

Further: no person shall publish an
advertisement along this line.
The procedure laid down by the bill is
very simple, and follows rather closely the
provisions of the present Industrial Relations
and Disputes Investigation Act. In the first
instance any person claiming to be aggrieved
may make a complaint in writing to the
director, so named under the act, an official
of the Department of Labour. The director
will instruct an officer of the department to
make inquiries-very much as in the case of
a strike or threatened strike. The officer
will make inquiries, and if it be possible,
perhaps through a little moral suasion, or
maybe some pressure, and no doubt by means
of a great deal of beneficial education, he
will bring about a settlement of the dispute.
If he should find this impossible he will
report back, and the case will go to a board
known as an Industrial Inquiry Commission.
That commission, operating very much in the
same way as boards of conciliation, may hear
evidence, conciliate if possible, bring about
a settlement of the difficulties, and finally
report to the minister. The minister will
send a copy of the report to all the parties
affected, and he is empowered to make
orders. He may order that the employee who
was discharged on the so-called objectionable
grounds be re-employed, and he may order
the employer to pay the wages the employee
lost, or he may order that the employer be
prosecuted in the courts. It is provided in
the bill that no prosecution can be made
under the act without the consent of the
Minister of Labour, so there can never be a
case of persecution of one person by another.
If in the discretion of the magistrate the
offence is sufficiently reprehensible, he may
impose a fine of $100 upon an individual or
$500 on a corporation or a union.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Under this act how would
you advise an employer, a general contractor,
who refused to give work to, say, Tim Buck,
or any of his associates?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I would advise the
employer to stick to his decision and not
employ Tim Buck or his associates if he did

I pause here to say that among the strongest
advocates of the principle of ithis bill are the
national labour organizations, who have
requested that provision in their annual submissions to the government year after year
for I do not know how many years.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Has the honourable gentleman any information with respect to the
constitutionality of the bill as it relates to
contracts of employment between employers
and employees?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I have made no special
study of it. I have not heard it questioned,
because the scope of the bill is very carefully
restricted to those matters which are within
the legislative control of the dominion
parliament.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Under section 3?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, under section 3.
I have not heard any suggestion of a contest
with regard to the constitutionality of the
provisions. I suppose somebody might argue
that a subcontractor who contracts with a
contractor who in turn is contracting with
the government is not subject to government
control, and that his rights fall under
"property and civil rights"; but I do not think
he would get far with that contention. If the
dominion government cannot regulate its own not want to.
contracts and those enterprises which by the

lame jurisdiction.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There is nothing in this
The section I have been reading provides legislation which would compel an employer

to hire Tim Buck.

because he has made a complaint or given evidence

MAY 6, 1953
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is right. But the
employer must not say to the person that he
will not employ him because he does not like
his nationality or race or colour or religion.
Hon. Mr. Vien: How would a commissioner
appointed under this legislation treat an
employer's objection expressed in these
words: "I am not satisfied on security
grounds"?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The commissioner
would undoubtedly uphold the employer in
his objection.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Would the employer have
to prove that he had good grounds on a
security basis to refuse employment?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No. The employer
would only have to establish that he did not
refuse employment on any of the grounds
which I have enumerated-race, national
origin, colour or religion.
Hon. Mr. Hawkins: Would it be necessary
for an employer to give his reason for not
employing a person?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No. He would not even
need to say "I don't like the colour of your
hair."
He need merely state "I am not
employing you." However, it would be a
different matter if the employer went on to
say he was not employing a person because
of his religion, unless, of course, religion was
a specific element in the work. For instance,
if a Presbyterian asked to be appointed as
a minister of a Baptist church, it would not
be unfair for the employer to turn the applicant down because of his religion. That, of
course, is a matter of common sense and is
provided for in the bill.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: Do I understand that it
is possible for an employer to discriminate
on any of these grounds so long as he does
not say so?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There is an old legal
saying that a man's mind is not triable, that
only his acts are. This may be one of the
weaknesses of the bill; but in all events the
bill will prevent bad manners, if nothing
else. It is not nice to say to a person, "I will
not employ you because of your religion."
Do not employ a person if you do not want
to, but do not give him reasons of that
kind.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: This will not really prevent discrimination.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Supposing an employer is
brought before the commission because of
having refused employment to, say, an Arab.
Will the commission bring that employer to

task and order him to state his reasons? I
think the powers of the commission are broad
enough to enable it to do this.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I do not think I can
answer the question. I would rely on the
common sense of the commissioners in such
a case.
Hon. Mr. Vien: You are taking very much
for granted.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I am sure they would
show common sense. There have been boards
of conciliation for years. The Labour Relations Board, for instance, bas been functioning under more difficult legislation than this
with a great deal of skill and competence.
I have no doubt that the commissioners, whoever they are, would not put themselves in
any such position as that.
Hon. Mr. Vien: In this bill we are creating
a lever. Supposing at some future date the
communists came into power in this country.
They could use this lever and appoint a
commission which would pass decisions that
might not be to our liking. So long as we
have as good a government as the present one
I would have no apprehension about this
legislation, but in years to come-a long,
long time from now-there may be a change
in government and the situation could be
different.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I suggest that if the
communists took over in Canada they would
find very much more drastic legislation to
take advantage of than this. In all events,.
the likelihood is so slight that we scarcely
need hesitate on that ground to pass a beneficent measure of this kind which attempts:
to bring about a kindlier and more polite and
unified society. I think we can take our
courage in our hands to that extent. Employers will not be forced to employ people they
do not want to hire. At the same time I am
sure the commission, backed up by the public,
will not allow employers to show discrimination on the grounds of race, national origin,
colour or religion.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question? Does this bill
take away the right of selection?
For
instance, supposing two men, one a Canadian
and the other a foreigner, come to me seeking employment, may I say that I will take
the Canadian because he is a Canadian and I
will not employ the other because he is not
a Canadian?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That would certainly
be on the borderline.
Hon. Mr. Horner: You may do it if you do
not say anything.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: If you did not say any-

thing you certainly would not violate the
act. But you could employ the Canadian,
expressly, because of his familiarity with the
country, rather than some new arrival. Certainly there is no objection in the act to that.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Those are extenuating
circumstances. That is not the question.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: You must not discriminate against an individual on the ground of
national origin. But I have no doubt you
could employ or reject any person you wished.
A bill of this kind has virtually no compulsory effect. The experience of New York
state justifies my statement. During the last
seven and a half years, in the handling of
2,500 cases, only three cases have been sent
to court; but by education and persuasion
they have brought about a little better
approach to this matter of discrimination than
otherwise there would have been.
In the dominion of Canada there are no
majorities, there is no class which outnumbers
all other clases. We are all minorities. It
is most essential that we preserve a kindly
attitude and do what we can to obliterate
hates, antagonisms and ignorances among the
various classes of people. I think this bill,
while it will not cure the whole trouble at
once by any means, will be a continual, though
not drastic, move in the right direction. People
are prone to obey the law. When I was a
young man, in Toronto, the young blades of
that day used to like to ride their bicycles
on the devil-strip; they would come like a
comet down the track and pass within inches
of an oncoming streetcar, putting the driver
of the car into a state of nervous collapse.
Every time this happened the driver would
imagine he could hear a bicycle and a man
being ground under the wheels of his car.
In time the city council passed a by-law
prohibiting cyclists from passing a streetcar
on the devil strip; and I remember that when
going downtown on the morning the by-law
came into effect I did not see even one young
man commit the offence. It was not that
the cyclists were afraid of prosecution, but
that they recognized the soundness of the law
and obeyed it. And today the red stoplights
are obeyed by motorists not so much because
of the presence of police as because these signals are a necessary means of protection of
the public.
Similarly, if parliament declares through
this 'bill that an employer must not discriminate against anyone on the grounds of race,
colour, creed and so forth, the good citizens,
at least, will take notice and to some extent
observe the principle of the law, and if they
do we shall have a kindlier and more
courteous society in which to live, and perhaps

greater national unity. I see no great objection to the bill, but I see a very great deal
of virtue in our attempt to prevent discrimination.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, I
have just a few remarks to make. I have
listened with interest to what the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) has said, but as I listened I wondered
if this legislation might not possibly lead to
more bitterness and discrimination than we
have ever known in this country up to the
present time. I think that an employer of
one or two persons has not the same problem,
in the matter of discrimination, as a big
employer of labour. When a large number
of employees of various kinds are thrown
together, and perhaps have to live in the same
bunk houses, non-discrimination does not
work out so well, no matter how good the
employer's intentions are. If we keep making
laws which cannot be enforced, people will
lose respect for the law generally. How many
honourable senators have had the experience
of motoring on our highways in districts
where signs plainly state that the speed limit
is 50 miles an hour, or perhaps 60 miles an
hour, and while keeping within the speed
limit passed by cars are going so fast that
one's own car seems to be almost stationary
on the road? It is true that the police patrol
the highways, but if they undertook to interfere in all cases of speeding their work would
never be done.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: But you would not
abolish the speed limit, would you?
Hon. Mr. Horner: No. I am really referring
to the question of belief, which you mentioned. Not all men who do not believe in
the hereafter are communists, by any means.
I have a good neighbour, who is observant of
the rights of others, and he does not believe in
the hereafter; but he is certainly not a communist.
It is very difficult to legislate in these matters. There is the problem of the person who
is seeking work but has refused to accept
work to which he is suited. There are many
reasons why a certain employee may not be
suitable to an employer. An employer might
not be willing to have a certain type of man
live with his other employees, and I do not
think legislation should try to force him to
employ anyone of that type. To put it briefly:
I do not think this legislation will accomplish
the result that some people think it will.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable

senators, when shall this bill be read the
third time?

MAY 6. 1953
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Unless there is any
desire that the bill be sent to committee, I
would ask that it be placed down for the
third reading at the next sitting.
SALACIOUS AND INDECENT
LITERATURE
REPORT OF COMMITTEEDEBATE CONCLUDED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of the report of the Special Committee appointed to inquire into the sale and
distribution of salacious and indecent literature in Canada.
Hon. Iva C. Fallis: Honourable senators,
in view of the lateness of the hour, I am
prepared to let this debate which stands
adjourned in my name stand over until
tomorrow.
Some Hon. Senators: Go ahead.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: I have only a few comments to make on the report and the work
of the committee. But before doing so I
should like to join with the speakers who
have preceded me in this debate in expressing appreciation of the work done by the
late Senator Doone, who at the time of his
death was chairman of the committee, and
to express my very deep personal regret at
his sudden passing.
I should like first to confess to the house
that when I was asked to serve as a member
of the committee I was not unduly impressed
with the necessity of the work contemplated,
and I undertook it merely in the line of
duty as a member of this house. Now, at the
close of our deliberations, after having listened to outstanding representatives of all
the major religious bodies in Canada, delegates from the Home and School and ParentTeacher associations, social welfare workers
and many others, present their views and
discuss this matter with us, I have changed
my mind as to the scope of this problem
and the necessity for at least trying to do
something about it.
I call to mind the flrst meeting of the
committee, when the first witness called
brought in several dozen copies of small
paper-covered publications with their lurid
covers, and spread them on the long table
before us. The next day the press commented
that the middle-aged and elderly senators
had gingerly and reluctantly handled these
books. I confess to being one of them. I can
still see myself as I drew one of those copies
towards me.
I was flrst shocked by the statement that
all these books had been purchased in
Canada from Canadian news stands. As I

examined them then-and more later onI decided that the great majority of them
were designed and written to appeal particularly to the teen-agers-chiefly, I should
say, to those of collegiate age.
I admit quite freely that until that first
meeting I had not known that such quantities of this pernicious stuff was being sold
freely across, not all but many, of the
counters of Canada.
Many people, I know, think that the extent
and importance of this matter have been
greatly exaggerated. They maintain that it
is very doubtful if much of this stuff is ever
read. My answer to them is twofold: First,
if there is not a large market in the reading
public, why has the volume of these publications increased by leaps and bounds over the
past few years? And secondly, from conversations I have had with parents and workers
in such organizations as the Home and School
and Parent-Teacher associations, and welfare
workers and so on, I am convinced that the
importance of it is not being over-emphasized.
I should like to mention here a statement
which has been made more than once in conversations on this subject, and recently was
referred to on a radio broadcast, to the effecit
that the Senate committee would like to see
abolished from the news stands all cheap,
paper-covered books, including reprints of
good books, mystery stories, Westerns, the
popular "whodunit" variety and other similar
publications. Nothing could be farther from
the truth. Our terms of reference specifically
state "salacious and indecent literature", and
at no time in our meetings did I hear any
member of the committee suggest that any
publication should be banned merely because
it was paper covered. It was the nature of
the publication itself with which we were
concerned, and what was on and between the
covers.
My opinion, which I expressed many times
in committee, is that what a person of mature
years reads should be left to his own
judgment and tastes; but when it comes to
matter which is especially designed to have
a detrimental influence on the immature
mind, that is an entirely different proposition.
It is to that phase of the question that my
remarks are directed; and it was that phase
of it which received almost exclusively the
attention and consideration of the members
of the committee.
I am not greatly impressed with an argument that was put forward in committee, that
no group of people meeting together would
agree on what is objectionable and what is
not objectionable in these soft-covered books

SENATE
for teen-agers, copies of which were submitted to us. I 'think I can suggest a simple
test which would be very revealing. We
have in this chamber members of every
province in Canada, of varying racial origins,
of different religious denominations, holding
vastly different views on many questions. But
I venture to say that if I were to give to
each member three or four copies of the
publications which I personally found objectionable, and asked them to read them, they
would be prepared to answer this simple
question: If you had a teen-age boy or girl
growing up in your home, would you like to
place these books in his or her hands for
reading? I am quite sure the answer would
be a practically unalnimous "No". The great
majority would consider them objectionable,
as I did.
I admit that if the test were carried a step
farther we might not find it so easy to agree
on what is "obscene", and we might have
difficulty getting unanimous condemnation,
because individuals vary greatly in what they
consider to be obscene. I believe that
the generally accepted interpretation of
"obscenity" in our courts today is that found
at page 517 of the Senate Hansard, which
contains the report of this committee. It is
the decision which wa's given by Chief Justice
Cockburn of Great Britain, wherein he said:

As every honourable senator knows, the
import problem is in the hands of the Customs
and Excise Division of the Department of
National Revenue. The particular item reads
as follows:
Books, printed paper, drawings, prints, photographs or representations of any kind of a treasonable or seditious or of an immoral or indecent
character.

It was estimated before your committee

that approximately 90 per cent of all the publications or the type of publications to which
your committee objected are imported from
the United States, either in book form or in
plates, and as the volume of all books
imported has risen over the years from about
two hundred titles to approximately three
thousand titles, one can readily appreciate
the enormous task which confronts the department. For this reason the committee made
one definite recommendation, which is found
on page 517 of Hansard:
Your committee recommends that the Excise
and Customs Division of the Department of National
Revenue expand its operations to meet proportionately the present serious threat to the moral
standards of Canada.
Honourable senators will agree that in making this recommendation the committee is not
asking that any new method or principle be
established. It merely asks that, because of
the greatly increased flow of publications
across the border into Canada, the facilities

be regarded as indecent.

MAY 6, 1953
Several witnesses who appeared before the
committee told us of what had been accomplished in various localities through community effort, organizations having combined
to build up community sentiment, and several
told us that through their efforts they were
able to have withdrawn from the newsstands in their areas the most objectionable
material. They did it through public sentiment, through the withdrawal of business
from those who catered almost exclusively
to the taste for this objectionable material.
In my opinion, honourable senators, the
greatest service which this committee has
rendered has been in drawing this matter to
the attention of the public at large.
I should like to read one paragraph from
the evidence of Mr. Sim. I asked him this
question:
If this committee, by directing publie attention
to this question, could arouse the people of Canada
to be more interested, would that strengthen
the hands of the government and the customs
officials?

Mr. Sim's answer was this:
I may say Mr. Chairman, that since this committee commenced its activities I have observed
that there is much wider public interest in the
subject and I think it is fair to say that we have
had brought to our attention a greater number of
copies of publications for examination and scrutiny.
I am sure that change is directly attributable to
the publicity which has arisen out of the research
that this committee has undertaken.

We had the statement made to us by different
witnesses who appeared before the committee
that through our work we have been the
means of arousing public interest in this
question in their communities. As a member
of this committee I feel that if we have done
nothing more than to draw this whole matter
to the attention of the Canadian public, all
the work which we have put into our inquiry
has been well worth while.
This afternoon when the honourable
gentleman from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) explained the measure to prevent
discrimination in regard to employment and
membership in trade unions, he spoke about
the value of public sentiment and public
opinion in the enforcement of this type of
legislation. May I quote from a statement
by Abraham Lincoln:

this time. First of all, I would congratulate
the honourable senator from Peterborough
(Hon. Mrs. Fallis) upon her splendid address
on the work of the special committee appointed
to inquire into the sale and distribution of
salacious and indecent literature.
Honourable senators, before this or any
country can build up social security it must
build up moral security, for without moral
security there can be no social security. In
my own district of Kennebec I have been
associated with various social organizations
for a period of over thirty years, and almost
daily these organizations have received the
confidences of fathers, mothers and children.
I should like to relate an experience of just a
few weeks ago. A young girl, the assistant
manager of the local caisse populaire, was
called at her home about 7 o'clock one evening by a young man of nineteen years of age.
He asked her for some money and the girl
said to him, "Well, I know you, but that is
not a sufficient reason for giving you money."
He replied, "I know you know me, and I
know you too, and I want money and that's
all there's to it." Well, eventually the girl
handed over $3,000 to the young man, who
immediately fled from the village. The villagers were alerted at once and gave chase
to the young man, who was eventually apprehended some ninety miles away, at Lévis. The
$3,000 was recovered and in his pockets were
discovered two crime-comic books.
Honourable senators, we cannot build a
nation by words alone. I agree with the
recommendation contained in the report of
the committee that we must prevent this type
of literature from coming into Canada. But
that is not the only thing to be done. I hope
that this committee will again function next
session in an attempt to recommend something
that can be done in a positive way to solve
this social problem. Salacious and indecent
literature and crime comics should be replaced
by good literature, so that our youth may
become better citizens than the adults of
today.

INTERNATIONAL

TRADE

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. A. Neil McLean presented the report

of the Standing Committee on Canadian Trade
Relations, as follows:

1. Pursuant to the order of reference dated
February 26 last whereby your committee was
authorized to inquire into and report on the most
further implementation of
practical steps to
article 2 of the North Atlantic Treaty, your committee has heard submissions from eleven leading
commercial, industrial, and labour organizations.
2. Through the presentations made by these
groups your committee bas become increasingly
aware of the great interest being shown by various
groups within this country, as well as without, in
order to eliminate conflict in the international
economic policies of member countries in this
North Atlantic alliance.
3. Your committee realized from the beginning of
this undertaking that there would be insufficient
time during the present sitting of parliament to
hear all those who wished to present views on this
matter. There are many additional groups who
have expressed a desire to appear before it. For
this reason it has not been possible to complete
findings and submit a report at this time.
4. Your committee therefore expresses the hope
that at the earliest possible date during the next
session of parliament your Canadian Trade Relations Committee be authorized to continue its work
under the present order of reference. The great
interest being shown by both national and international organizations in this important matter
emphasizes the necessity of reaching conclusions
from which may emerge constructive ideas for
closer economic collaboration among signatories
of the North Atlantic Treaty.
5. Your committee also recommends that if the
present work of the Canadian Trade Relations
Committee is resumed during the next session of
parliament, it be authorized to retain an economic
consultant or other qualified person or persons to

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall the report be taken into

PUBLIC SERVICE SUPERANNUATION
BILL
MOTION

FOR THIRD READING-AMENDMENT
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Senate resumed fromn yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Robertson for the third reading of Bill 334,
an Act to provide for the superannuation of
persons employed in the Public Service of
Canada, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Marcotte
in amendment.
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators will recaîl that the debate was
adjourned yesterday by the Whip, so that any
honourable senator who wîshed to take part
in the debate today might do so. As I have
already spoken on the amendment, I am
unable to speak again except with the
unanimous leave of the house. If that courtesy is extended to me I shaîl make a brief
statement, solely for the purpose of indicating
the views of the governent, of which I arn
a member, in respect to, the amendment. I
shahl not trespass further on the Senate's
time.
Some Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: We have not received
a copy of yesterday's Hansard yet. If the
amendment is going to be debated this afternoon I shail need a copy of Hansard for
reference purposes.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: May I be permitted to,
make my statement? I shall have no objection to a further adjourrnent of the debate
after that.
Borne Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I have consulted the
government with respect to, their views on
the propôsed amendmnent. They think that fI
is superfluous but, if the Senate feels that it
is desirable, they can see no objection.
The government have not intended in the
past nor do they now intend to attempt to
interfere in any way with the right of either
house with respect to the control or rernoval
of its officers, clerks or ernployees.

SENATE

The fact that the reference to the right of
parliament with respect to the control and
removal of its employees was not included
in the bill's definition of "Public Service"
was, as far as I can gather, primarily a legal
and drafting matter. In the opinion of the
draftsmen it had no bearing. As far as I
can ascertain, there is no intention on the
part of the government, when framing the
regulations having to do with the cessation
of employment generally in the public service, to interfere with the peculiar rights and
privileges of the houses of parliament.
However, since the question has arisen, I
think it is only fair to add that, generally
speaking, the government feel it is desirable
that there should be a uniform practice
throughout the public service with respect to
age of retirement, but whether the houses of
parliament who legislate for others in respect
to this matter wish to conform to that general
practice with respect to their own employees,
or how they do it, is for each house to
determine.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: I take that to mean
that my amendment will be adopted.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I did not say that. I
said the government can see no objection.
It is for the Senate to decide.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: I take it that if they
have no objection the amendment will be
adopted.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: That is a matter for
the house to decide.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: The amendment has to
be disposed of one way or the other.
Hon. Mr. Robertson:
I have simply
expressed the government's point of view on
the amendment. Now it is up to the house to
make its own decision on it.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: If there is to be a discussion on the amendment, I will insist that
we have before us the report of yesterday's
debate. If there is to be no discussion, the
amendment is adopted and the matter is concluded.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I repeat, it is for the
house to decide what shall happen to the
amendment.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: Will the honourable
leader of the government tell me what is the
proper procedure?
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
the question has yet to be put to the house.
As I understand the proceedings thus far, the
honourable leader of the government has

stated the government's view as to the amendment, namely, that the Senate is at liberty to
deal with its own officers, clerks and
employees as it sees fit. It remains for this
house to express its will on the amendment,
and the only way that can be done is by voting
on it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, may I
be allowed to explain the situation to my
honourable friend from Ponteix (Hon. Mr.
Marcotte)? The minister (Hon. Mr. Robertson) has given us the opinion of the government, that this house may vote as it likes on
the amendment.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: That is it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: We can adopt the amendment or reject it. The government will not
interfere in any way with our decision in
that respect.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: Honourable senators, I
do not need the advice of my honourable
leader as to the meaning of words. I ask that
we do not proceed any further until the report
of yesterday's debates is distributed.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I have no objection to
a further adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: If there is no attempt
on the part of the government to interfere
with our rights, the amendment I proposed is
adopted and the matter is closed. Our next
step should be to pass the bill. As I said
yesterday, I did not propose to discuss the
merits of the bill; I was attempting, by my
amendment, to safeguard the rights of the
Senate and House of Commons in the control
of their employees.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
the debate may proceed if someone wishes to
speak on the amendment; otherwise the
debate must be closed. If the mover of the
amendment speaks to it he will close the
debate.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Honourable senators. I
should like to ask a question for my own
information. In my opinion the amendment
presented by the honourable senator from
Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte) is not in proper
form. Should he not make a motion to this
effect: that the bill be not now read a third
time but that it be referred back to the
committee?
Some Hon. Senators: No, no.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
the amendment before the house reads as
follows:
Page 2, line 25. After the word "parliament",
insert the following words: "but saving all rights
and privileges of either house in respect of the
control or removal of its officers, clerks and
employees".

MAY 7. 1953
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I think the lawyers in
this chamber, with their legal phraseology
and arguments, are putting the laymen in a
rather difficult position. Frankly, I do not
know how to vote. I therefore move, in
amendment to the amendment, that the said
amendment be not now concurred in but that
it be referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. Daigle: I second that.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Burchill was
agreed to, and the amendment of Hon. Mr.
Marcotte was referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishari McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 366, an Act to amend
the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1940.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of the amendment set out in this bill is to
provide payment of unemployrnent insurance
benefits to insured persons who, while otherwise employed and entitled to benefits,
become incapacitated for work by reason of
illness or injury. This amendment affects
section 27 of the act, which specifies three
basic conditions as 'being necessary in order
to entitle a person to benefits. They are:
(1) that the person must be unemployed;
(2) he must be capable of and available for
work; (3) he must be unable to obtain suitable employment. The first and third conditions remain unchanged. However, the second
condition, which prohibits the Unemployment
Insurance Commission from paying benefits
to a claimant for any days on which he is
incapable of or unavailable for work, has
resulted in hardship to many claimants in
that they were unable to draw their
unemployment insurance because they were
sick or injured. This stems from the
requirement that the applicant, although
unemployed, must be in a position to accept
employment when it is offered him. In the
future when a job is offered to a claimant
drawing benefits he will not be disqualified
from payments under the act if he is unable
to accept the job because of illness or injury,
but if he fails to prove that he is ill or
injured he will be disqualified.
The bill contemplates no change in the
amount of benefits to be paid or the length
of time for which benefits are established.
While the cost of the change cannot be
clearly estimated, it does not follow that the

proposal will require any additional contributions to the unemployment insurance fund.
This is legislation which bas been encouraged by labour congresses and various other
groups; and doubtless it will commend itself
to honourable senators as being a fair and
just extension of our present unemployment
insurance benefits.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I am not sure that I understand this bill, but
my impression of what it means is that, if
I am under the unemployment insurance
scheme, and am unemployed, and become
sick, I am compensated. That is, I am paid
under the act while unemployed; if I then
become sick I am paid; and if I am injuredHon. Mr. Aseltine: Outside of your employment.
Hon. Mr. Haig: -outside of my employment, I am paid. If it is the general desire
that this provision be made, I have no objection, but I do not think it should be described
as unemployment insurance; it is a welfare
contribution.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: A bonus.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is what it looks like
to me. The explanatory note describes it
fairly well. It states:
This subsection is new. It provides for the payment of unemployment insurance benefits to insured
persons who, while otherwise unemployed and
entitled to benefit, become incapacitated for work
by reason of illness or injury.

The injury can only be such as happens
outside a person's work, because a person
who is injured while at work comes under
the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act in his province. Yet the unemployment insurance fund is to be drawn upon for
the payments in respect of his illness. If
that is what is intended, it is at variance
with the statement which was made in this
house when the Unemployment Insurance
Act was passed. We were then told that the
purpose was to provide for demands consequent upon real unemployment.
Nobody
anticipates a large drain on the fund when
conditions are normal. As we heard the
other day in committee, the course of history,
at any rate in the past thirty or forty years,
has been war, followed by depression and
unemployment, and then another war; and
the suggestion was made that this cycle is
about to begin again. Yet the fund is to be
drawn upon, not only for increased unemployment payments, but to meet the costs of
illness and injury incurred by persons when
not employed. It is all very well to say that
no additional cost will be entailed by the bill.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Haig: The workman must be
unemployed in order to receive unemployment insurance benefits. This bill provides;
that a person who becomes ili while drawing
benefits will continue
to draw them.
Apparently, if a workman becomes iii while
unemployed and receiving payments from
the fund, he will continue to receive them
after bis present rights under the act run out.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is the way 1 interpret
the language of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: If my honourable
friend will pardon me for saying so, that is
just what the bill does not provide. It simply
provides that if a person becomes ill or sustains injury while in receipt of unemployment insurance payments he will continue
to draw thern.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Under the act an
unernployed workman who is eligible to
receive unemployment insurance payrnents
draws so much a week, provided he is willing
and able to accept suitable employrnent. In
order to draw any benefits he must report
weekly to the offices of the Unemployrnent
Insurance Commission.
The Commission
offers him jobs, and if he does flot take any
of thern and his time of entitiement to benefits runs out he ceases to draw benefits. But
this legisiation provides that if a person
becomes ili or is injured while in receipt of
unernployment insurance benefits, he wil
continue to receive them-and that can only
mean after bis period of entitlement runs out.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Oh, no0.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: No.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: May I explain èxactly
what this means?
Supposing a man is
entitled to receive unemployment insurance
payments for twenty weeks. Let us say that
at some time in that twenty-week period he
becomes iii or is injured in an automobile
accident. Under the present act bis unemployment insurance payments would then
stop. The proposed amendment provides that

0f course the bill will cost something, and
those people wh-o will have to pay are al
the contributors to the fund, including the
government-to whose contribution I do not
object. I amrn ot opposing the bill, but I do
flot think it should be recommended to us
upon the assumption that it will involve no0
increase in payments, for that cannot be so.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Is my friend's objection to
the bill that a person would be paid twice:
first, under the Unemployment Insurance Act
because of being unemployed; and secondly,
under the Workmen's Compensation Act,
because of illness or injury. I wonder
whether a man would corne under the Workmen's Compensation Act by reason of illness.
Hon. Mr. Haig: If the workman is injured

Workmen's Compensation Act.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I can understand that he
would qualify for benefits if he were injured,
but would he be eligible under that act in
the case of illness?
Hon. Mr. Haig: In my province, if the iliness were attributable to bis occupation, yes;
otherwise, no0.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Then the workman does
not qualify in the case of ordinary illness?
Hon. Mr. Haig: If we are going to pay
workmen when they are iii we shall be providing them with a form of health relief. I
would flot object if the goverfiment wanted
to introduce legisiation to provide compensation benefits to workmen when il-I could
understand that-but it is a different thing
to provide such benefits out of money collected for unernployment insurance. The
unemployment insurance scheme has nothing
at all to do with sickness, yet under this
amendment to the act a person would be paid
unemployment insurance when ill.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: While flot in bis

Hon. Mr. Haig: The bill does flot contain
those words.

MAY 7, 1953
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The bill does not
increase the insurance benefit nor continue it
beyond the period it would normally run.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, then, it seems to me
that this amendment is not needed. Unless
I refuse to accept suitable employment, there
is absolutely nothing in the present act to
prevent me from drawing benefits for those
twelve months.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Yes. You must be capable
of working.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I know that. But surely the
commission would not have to pay me for
my own carelessness if I were to get injured
while unemployed. That is what this bill
means. Sickness may not fall in that category, but injury does.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The bill is very clear.
For purposes of illustration let us take twenty
weeks as the period during which an unemployed person is entitled to unemployment
insurance benefits. During that period he
tries to obtain employment, but sickness or
injury strikes him. It is my opinion that
the amendment would entitle him to continue
receiving the benefits nevertheless.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Within the twentyweek period.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Yes; the payments
would not extend beyond that twenty-week
period.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That might be so in the
case of illness, although the bill does not
read that way. A person who is injured
certainly should not qualify. It is his own
fault if he is injured, nobody else's.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. Haig: This amendment will add
to the cost of providing unemployment insurance. I do not think the benefits should be
extended, for unemployment insurance is of
absolutely no value to many people. For
instance it is of no value to lawyers, doctors
or bankers. Doctors who are not working
for themselves have to pay unemployment
insurance if their income is under a certain
amount, but there is little possibility of their
ever drawing any benefit from the fund.
Honourable senators, I repeat that if this
legislation passes it will just add to the cost
of providing unemployment insurance; and I
object to that.
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators, if
we agree with the principle that persons
should continue to receive unemployment

insurance benefits in the event that they are
injured or become ill or are quarantined
during the period they otherwise would be
eligible to draw unemployment insurance,
then the logical and practical way to give
effect to our intention is to adopt the bill
before us. It is impossible at the present
time to meet otherwise the wishes which have
been expressed by the various trade unions;
in other words, we cannot enact what I
would call a special sickness-unemployment
insurance law. The only thing we can do at
this time is to assist those who, while drawing
unemployment insurance payments-and the
payments are not exorbitant by any meansbecome incapacitated for work by reason of
illness or injury or quarantine. We must not
assume that people are injured or become ill
voluntarily. Genuine illness or injury has to
be proved in order to entitle a person to
benefit under the Workmen's Compensation
Acts; and so it would be under this amendment.
Of course, if a man is receiving benefits
under a Workmen's Compensation Act he
will not be entitled to benefit under the
Unemployment Insurance Act. The purpose
of this amendment is simply this: that if a
person while unemployed and in receipt of
benefits under the Unemployment Insurance
Act becomes incapacitated for work because
of sickness or injury or quarantine, the sickness or injury or quarantine will not disqualify him from continuing to receive
benefits.
The bill enlarges the scope of the Unemployment Insurance Act. In so doing it
conforms to what has for several years been
the policy of the government. I submit,
honourable senators, that that policy has met
with the approval of the Canadian people.
Hon. John J. Kinley: Honourable senators,
it seems to me that this is very reasonable
and fair legislation. I do not think we should
confuse unemployment insurance with workmen's compensation. Workmen's compensation provides benefits to persons who are
injured or contract an occupational disease
during the course of their employment. But
people who receive unemployment insurance
benefits must be employable and unemployed. That is a test under the act.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: Quite.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: If a man is listed as
unemployed and eligible for unemployment
insurance, and the unemployment insurance
officer in charge of the district offers him a
job, he must take it. And under the present

SENATE

act, if it is reported to the officer that the man
is sick and cannot take a job, he forgoes his
unemployment insurance. This is a safeguard
to the man, who is entitled to receive unemployment insurance according to his length
of service. The man and the firm for which
he works are both required to pay into the
fund, and the state also contributes. Under
this bill the workman is guaranteed unemployment insurance benefits even if he
becomes ill during the period of his entitlement. It seems to me that is a fair provision
and I think the legislation is salutary.

CRIMINAL CODE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishar McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 367, an Act to amend
the Criminal Code.
He said: Honourable senators, the subjectmatter of this particular bill was before us
in the bill covering the general revision of
the Criminal Code. This measure becomes
necessary by reason of the fact that the
revision and consolidation of the Code will
not be completed at this session.
Under section 1056 of the Criminal Code
provision is made that persons serving sentences of less than two years shall be held
in the jail of the district, country or place
in which the sentence was passed, or, if there
is no jail at that location, in a jail at the
nearest locality, but in any case the prisoner
is to be held in a place other than a penitentiary.
In Newfoundland the penitentiary in St.
John's is the place where persons serving
life terms, or terms of more than two years,
are held. It also is a place of imprisonment
for those serving sentences of less than two
years.
At the time when Newfoundland became
the tenth province of Canada the Criminal
Code was amended to authorize the continuance of the arrangement until January 1,
1954; that is, the same building would function as a provincial jail and a federal penitentiary. It was intended that when the new
Criminal Code consolidation was passed it
would contain a provision that this arrangement should continue until a proclamation
by the governor in council authorized some
other arrangement. Since the Criminal Code
will not be passed at this session, it is necessary to enact this legislation in order to
provide for the continuance of the present
arrangement in Newfoundland on and after
January 1, 1954.
The purpose of this bill is, in brief, to
authorize the use of the provincial institution as a federal penitentiary jail. There
appears to be no reason why there should be
any change just now. Newfoundlanders are
apparently not serious lawbreakers; at
present there are only twenty-nine of them

serving terms of more than two years. All
concerned in Newfoundland have expressed a
desire that a proposal to move those persons
to Dorchester Penitentiary, which is the
penitentiary generally used in the Maritime
Provinces, should not be effected 'at the
moment. The present arrangement appears
to be the most satisfactory one that can be
made for the time being. For those reasons
there appears to be no immediate plan for
any change in this arrangement, and the bill
would authorize continuation of the plan.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: If we did not pass the
bill, what would the picture be then?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I suppose that the institution in St. John's would have to fall either
into the category of a penitentiary alone,
whereupon it would be used only for the
incarceration of prisoners serving terms of
more than two years; or the reverse-which
is probably the more likely-into the category
of a jail, suitable for those committed for less
than two years, in which event persons
sentenced to terms of more than two years
would, I suppose, au(tomatically go to one
of the recognized penitentiaries, probably
Dorchester. Apparently, at the moment, no
agreement has been reached. The numbers
involved are not sufficient to create any great
problem. I think the desire of the department is to work out some amicable arrangement in due course.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Is it not a bit undesirable to have men on short terms serving in
the same institution or under 'the same roof
with penitentiary habitues?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I should think that is
so; and I have no doubt that at the time of
the Union that was the idea in providing
for continuation of the existing arrangement
only until the lst of January 1954. I suppose
that so far as long-established local customs
are concerned it is perhaps better to
endeavour to improve them through a certain
degree of agreement with the local authorities, rather than by following the strict letter
of the federal law. That is the nearest
approach I can make to the matter.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Sometimes it is a good
idea to shake up some of these old customs
and make somebody do a little thinking
about them, and in consequence perhaps
make a new arrangement. I do not like this
arrangement as it stands. Of course there is
nothing to do but pass the bill, for the
arrangement would have been passed in the
Code, had the Code come before us; but at
the same time it is not a desirable situation,
and some really thoughtful work should be
ione. There was criticism in another place

MAY 12, 1953
about the overcrowding; but from what the
leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) says that is
apparently not an element rthat we need concern ourselves about at present. But the idea
of having a county jail and a penitentiary
in the one place and under the same roof is
not something that should be continued. I
suppose that when the Code comes before us
it will include this same provision, for it is
not likely to be the subject of an independent
act. We can give it thought again at that
time. But I would suggest to the government
that in the meantime active steps be taken
to bring about a really satisfactory solution
of this problem.
Hon. W. M. Aseline: Honourable senators,
like the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) I do not feel that
this arrangement is a very good one. For as
long as I can remember, in the other provinces people sentenced to two years less one
day, or to any period up to two years, have
been incarcerated in the provincial jails. The
hardened criminals, of course, were kept in
the penitentiaries. But I do not see any way
out of the present difficulty in NewfouUdland,
and I can only suggest to the government
that the situation there be corrected as soon
as possible.
My main purpose in rising at this time
is to note my regret that the bill to revise
the Criminal Code will not be passed at this
session. I certainly hope that the great
amount of work done by a committee of the
Senate and by a committee of the other house
will not be lost.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It will not be lost.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: But a new bill will have
to be presented at the next session, and so
comprehensive is the subject that the bill may
not be passed even then. Careful consideration of such a measure requires many weeks.
I am not sure how we can avoid losing much
of the benefit of the work that has gone into
the present Criminal Code bill, but I hope
that when a new measure is presented to
parliament this coming fall or winter we shall
not be required to go through it from beginning to end.
As to the somewhat simple measure now
before us, I may say that Newfoundland is
more fortunate than most provinces in having
no overcrowded prisons.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Perhaps they are catching fewer criminals down there.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I understand that Nova
Scotia bas a "waiting list" of persons sentenced to less than two years for whom jail
space is lacking.
We on this side of the house-having suggested to the government that the situation

in Newfoundland should be corrected as soon
as possible-have no objection to the bill being
given the second and third readings this afternoon.
I should like to ask the honourable leader
of the 'government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) what
legislation other than the supply bill remains
to be sent over to us this session?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I know of no other
legislation than the supply bill based on the
estimates.
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators, I
agree entirely with the remarks of the honourable senators from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck) and Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine). It is not desirable that penitentiaries
and prisons be placed under -one administration.
Some sixteen years ago the Archambault
commission travelled widely and studied in
great detail problems of prison administration, reform and the rehabilitation of
prisoners. In a most complete report, Mr.
Justice Archambault drew the attention of
parliament to the necessity for segregation of
prisoners and to modern methods for their
rehabilitation.
I think we are somewhat remiss in paying
too little attention to the social need for
returning prisoners to civil life. Especially
is this true when we consider that perhaps
more than 50 per cent of those sentenced to
confinement are under the age of thirty
years, and a considerable proportion under
twenty years. It is most unfortunate if young
prisoners, particularly first offenders, are confined in close proximity to hardened criminals who, though they have been punished
many times, are not penitent. I would suggest that the report of the Archambault
commission be again brought to light and its
recommendations put into effect.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the honourable senator if it is not true that a great
many recommendations of that commission
have been carried out?
Hon. Mr. Vien: Yes, quite a number have;
but there are some capital recommendations
which have not as yet been put into effect.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Will my honourable
friend specify them?
Hon. Mr. Vien: Yes. I am glad that the
honourable senator has invited me to do so.
First, it was recommended that youthful
prisoners be segregated frorn older ones, and
first offenders from hardened criminals;
secondly, that facilities should be provided
for studying the aptitude of prisoners in
preparation for their return to civil life;

SENATE
thirdly, that farming and industrial institutions be set up in which young prisoners,
while serving their sentences, could be
trained in the particular occupation for
which they have the taste and capacity, so
as to be provided with a means of livelihood
and thus have a better chance of once again
becoming useful, respectable citizens.
A provision of this character should be
part of the institutional set-up, with parliament providing each year a reasonable
amount of money for the re-education of
prisoners and their re-adaptation to civil life.
Money provided for this purpose would be
well invested. These were the recommendations. I believe that in part they have been
implemented, but there remains much to be
done. For one thing our jails and penitentiaries are overcrowded.
Furthermore the
custodial staffs of jails and penitentiaries are
seldom composed of trained persons with
the psychological knowledge to enable them
to deal with the particular types of individuals
of whom they have charge. We pay these
guards a pittance-some of them no more
than $20 or $22 a week. They have had no
appropriate training; they are not competent
to discharge the functions that are required
of them.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Does not the honourable
senator's reference to low salaries apply to
guards in provincial jails rather than to those
in federal penitentiaries? I have in mind
the conditions revealed in a jail in Toronto.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I was thinking of the
Bordeaux Jail at Montreal.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It was my thought that
the criticism regarding low salaries is more
applicable to provincial jails than to federal
penitentiaries.
Hon. Mr. Vien: In so far as this is a provincial matter, I suggest it is one which the
Department of Justice could very properly
take up with the provincial authorities. But
I think the same principles apply both to
penitentiaries and to jails, although I agree
that the salaries of the penitentiaries' staffs
are higher than those paid the custodians of
provincial jails.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Some of them.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Some of them. But irrespective of the salary question, I believe that
we do not give sufficient attention to the
qualifications which should be expected and
exacted from those whom we appoint to be
custodians of persons - confined in these
institutions. We should train them for the
specific purpose of enabling them to

re-educate prisoners for adaptation to civil
life and the social set-up to which they will
have to return. I think that that part of my
reasoning applies both to federal and provincial jails.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: We thought we were
doing that when we appointed General
Gibson.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I suggest this is one of the
matters which the federal and provincial governments could very well study together so
as to adopt a general policy for the common
good. Therefore I agree with my honourable
friend that, while we must accept this bill
as a temporary expedient-we cannot very
well do otherwise-it is proper to recommend
to the government that something else must
be done, and that planning for the future
should be on a different basis. It should
apply not only to Newfoundland, but to Canada at large; it should be such as would avoid
overcrowding of penal institutions and permit
a proper distribution of the inmates; and it
should provide for suitable training and
proper. education to adapt these people to
the roles they will be called upon to play
in civil life.
More than that: some attention should be
given to former inmates after their discharge.
The fact that they have been incarcerated
in a penitentiary or a jail should not be a
black mark against them. They should be
helped, not persecuted-as discharged prisoners too often have been. We should assist
them along the lines followed in many states
of the United States, where organizations
exist to encourage and help ex-prisoners, even
to provide jobs for them, employers being
notified of their history and co-operating to
help them to re-establish themselves.
I believe that this is a matter of great
importance. The Archambault report, is a
very comprehensive document. We should
take it out of its pigeon-hole and give our
undivided attention to the very serious problem with which it deals.
As regards the other question which was
raised by my honourable friend from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), I do not believe
that it would be in order to discuss it at this
juncture, but I agree with him in the views
he has expressed.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable senators, it is not evident to me that any of the
findings of the Archambault report were based
upon a particular investigation of conditions
in Newfoundland. However, we do know
that the number of persons who are confined

MAY 12, 1953
within the precincts of the prison in Newfoundland is about twenty-nine. It would be
interesting to have a classification of them,
in order to know how many are admitted for
two years or less, how many for more than
two years, and how many may be regarded as
of a class usually sentenced to a penitentiary.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I understand that that
institution houses some hardened criminals.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The institution, which is
called a penitentiary has, I think, twenty-nine
inmates, including those sentenced to two
years or more. Evidently in Newfoundland
no distinction is made between prisoners who
are committed for relatively short terms and
the hardened criminal class commonly confined exclusively in penitentiaries in other
provinces. My point is that conditions in
Newfoundland apparently differ greatly from
those in the area investigated by the Archambault Commission.
Off-hand, I see no reason for hastening the
day when the new province of Newfoundland
will celebrate its entry into the Dominion of
Canada by applying to the law of that province a different interpretation of the word
"penitentiary". Probably before urging the
separation of prisoners in Newfoundland we
should have some further light thrown on
their classification.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Would the honourable senator allow me a question? Is human nature
not pretty much the same in Newfoundland as
elsewhere?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Well, I am doubtful
about that. I am inclined to think that from
a social point of view there is some advantage
in living on an island like Newfoundland,
where moral infection, at least, might not be
quite as pronounced as it is in more urban
communities.
In any event, the point of view of the
prisoners themselves also has to be considered,
and I am informed that they do not want to
be moved at all. While I suppose that
prisoners in Newfoundland, as elsewhere in
Canada, have no vote at election times, it is
quite possible that people who are interested
so heartily in the great movement of prison
and penitentiary reform have obtained the
point of view of persons incarcerated in
various places who have demanded reform.
Well, if there is no overcrowding in the Newfoundland prison and the inmates do not want
to be moved, I cannot see any reason for suggesting that they be transferred to a penitentiary in Nova Scotia or any other part of
Canada.

Hon. Mr. Lambert: How many?
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: He did not say.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I understood the total
number of prisoners was twenty-nine.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Oh, no. There may be
many more who are serving sentences of
under two years.
Hon. Cairine R. Wilson: I should like to
assure honourable senators that there are
John Howard Societies in, I think, practically
every province, and they are doing their best
to care for prisoners both during their term
of incarceration and after release. I had
the privilege of listening to Major Edmison,
Executive Director of the John Howard
Societies of Canada, when he spoke of many
cases in which surprisingly good positions
had been secured for prisoners who had been
given training during their terms of incarceration. Two or three obtained excellent
positions on newspapers, thanks to their
experience in editing penitentiary papers.
General Gibson, Chief Commissioner of Penitentiaries was present when Major Edmison
spoke, and could corroborate what I am saying. True, the Archambault Commission found
deplorable conditions in local jails, and I
fear that in a great many cases conditions
have not been remedied. One jail with which
I am familiar, at St. Andrews, New Brunswick, was constructed more than one hundred
years ago, and the accommodation leaves
much to be desired. One interesting case
there was that of a man who was imprisoned
for debt. Various people took an interest
in his case, and, because he had no teeth,
brought him special food.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Honourable senators, the
honourable senator from Mille Isles (Hon. Mr.
Daigle) has drawn my attention to a matter
I mentioned earlier. Complaints of bad
management in jails apply for the most part
to provincial rather than federal institutions.
I am glad to be allowed to make that correction. I am glad also that my deskmate (Hon.
Mrs. Wilson) has told of some very constructive steps that have been taken along the
lines I have advocated.
Hon. Mrs. Wilson: May I be permitted to
add that an international penal conference is
to be held in Toronto in the autumn, attended
by representatives from the United States,
Canada and Europe.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I think I am correct in
saying that the minister stated in the other
place that twenty-nine persons sentenced for
two years and over were inmates of that
institution. There may be many more inmates.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall the bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I move the third reading now.

THE SENATE
Thursday, May 14, 1953
The Senate met at 11 a.m., the Acting
Speaker (Hon. Thomas Vien, P.C.,) in the
Chair.
Prayers and routine proceedings.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
while I have no definite information on the
progress of the other house towards completion of the business before it, there is evidence that the skies are clearing. It would
probably be advisable for us to remain in
close proximity to the buildings, in the hope
that prorogation may take place later today.
I would therefore ask the house to adjourn
during pleasure, to reassemble at the call
of the bell at approximately 3 o'clock this
afternoon.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
At 3 p.m. the sitting was resumed.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I have been advised that there is a fair possibility that the other house will conclude its
business this evening, but there remains a
question whether in any event it will conclude early enough to permit prorogation
tonight.
I would respectfully ask all honourable
senators who may find it convenient to do so,
to remain in Ottawa until the sessidn is prorogued, so that attendance in the house may
be maintained.
I now move, honourable senators, that the
house adjourn during pleasure, to reassemble
at the call of the bell, at approximately 8
o'clock this evening.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
At 8 p.m. the sitting was resumed.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Honourable senators,
the latest word from the other house is that
there is a chance of finishing tonight. Therefore, I suggest that we should adjourn now
and corne back at about 10 o'clock. If there
is then no prospect of finishing tonight the
proposal likely will be to meet tomorrow
morning at 11.
I move that the Senate adjourn during
pleasure, to re-assemble at the call of the
bell, at approximately 10 o'clock.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
68112--41à

At 10 p.m. the sitting was resumed.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Honourable senators, I
have just come from conferring with the
Prime Minister regarding the progress being
made in the other house. He is of the opinion
that that house will have concluded its business within the next three-quarters of an
hour and that we shall be able to prorogue
later this evening. I move, therefore, that we
adjourn again during pleasure, to re-assemble
at the call of the bell, in approximately threequarters of an hour.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
At 11.15 p.m. the sitting was resumed.
PROROGATION OF PARLIAMENT
The Hon. the Acting Speaker informed the
Senate that he had received a communication
from the Secretary of the Governor General,
acquainting him that the Honourable Patrick
Kerwin, the Deputy of His Excellency the
Governor General, would proceed to the Senate Chamber this day at 11.30 p.m. for the
purpose of proroguing the present session of
Parliament.
APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 3
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 368, an Act for granting to
Her Majesty certain sums of money for the
public service of the financial year ending
the 31st March, 1954.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, when shall the said bill be read the
second time?
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable
senators, I move the second reading now.
This bill is the third of the supply bills
which• have come before us this session.
Appropriation Bill No. 1 covered interim
supply for the first part of the fiscal year
beginning April 1, 1953, and ending March
31, 1954. It consisted of one-sixth of the
items to be voted in the main estimates for
the fiscal year, and in addition it included
proportional expenditures on certain items,
of which the major portion was to be e*pended early in the year. That bill provided
interim supply in the amount of $537,674,515.18.
Appropriation Bil No. 2 merely covered the
end-of-the-year supplementary estimates for
1952-53, amounting to $77,680,383.

SENATE
Bill No. 368, which is now before us, asks
for a total of $2,712,154,146.82. This amount
is made up of the balance of the main estimates remaining unappropriated at the
present time, in the amount of $2,670,917,028.82, together with a sum of $41,237,118
provided for in the further supplementary
estimates which earlier were tabled in the
other place. It will be appreciated that to
these amounts appropriated by parliament
must be added the amount authorized by
statute in the sum of $1,580,671,937, bringing
the total of the expenditures authorized by
the present bill, including the supplementary
estimates, and by statute as well as by the
interim supply bill previously mentioned, to
$4,830,500,599.
The form of the bill follows in all respects
that of the main supply bill which comes
to us at the end of every session.
Section 1 is simply the short title.
Section 2 provides for the balance of the
main estimates after deducting amounts already voted under Appropriation Act No. 1
earlier this year. As I have already mentioned, this balance amounts to $2,670,917,028.82.
Details of the items in the main estimates
are to be found in schedule A to the bill.
Section 3 provides further supplementary
estimates for the year 1953-54, totalling
$41,237,118, details of which are found in
schedule B. Among the major items contained in these estimates is a $9 million
amount to provide for the restoration of the
special account in the consolidated revenue
fund established by section 35 of the National
Housing Act and used by Central Mortgage
and Housing Corporation in joint housing
projects with the various provincial governments. The other major items include a
sum of $1 million for the Immigration Branch
for assistance to immigrants, $1 million for
industrial development services to the Department of Fisheries, $1J million towards
the fisheries industry in Newfoundland, over
$2 million for the Dominion Coal Board in
connection with the movement of coal, an
item of nearly $4 million for the Post Office
for operations and for transportation of mail,
and a sum of $54 million for public works in
various provinces. Details of the remaining
items may be found in schedule B.
Section 4 of the bill is the usual authorization for the governor in council to raise,
by way of loan, a sum not exceeding $500
million which may be required from time
to time throughout the year for various
purposes.
Section 5 provides that the usual accounts
will be submitted in detail to the House of
Commons.

As I have already intimated, the bill is in
the usual form of the supply bill submitted
to us at the end of a session, and details of
the expenditures may be found in the schedules to the bill. I submit the bill, therefore,
to the house for its favourable consideration
and early approval.
In presenting this bill at this stage one is
quite aware that the limited time at our
disposal permits us to do no more than
merely review the items that were covered
by the previous supply bills and the amount
voted by the main supply bill, which is now
before us. I can only apologize to the house
for not having had a more adequate opportunity of examining the bill at greater length;
but I know that honourable members have
already had the opportunity of seeing the
estimates for each department and of following the debate upon them in the other bouse.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
I do not see how I can deal with this matter
adequately in the short time at my disposal.
I might have attempted to make a long
speech and hold things up until tomorrow,
but when I make a speech I like to have a
good audience. My audience this evening
is rather small, and for that reason I may
cut my remarks down by a considerable
extent.
This measure authorizes the expenditure of
the huge sum of almost $5 billion. In fact,
having listened to the explanation by the
honourable acting leader of the government
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) and tried to assimilate
some of the information he gave, I am left
more or less gasping. In the short time available to me I am of course unable to deal with
the many items in detail.
It is true, however, that the estimates have
been before us for several months, and in
that period honourable senators have had an
opportunity to examine them. Also in the
House of Commons Hansard we have been
able to follow the debates on them in that
chamber. But in spite of that opportunity to
familiarize ourselves with the estimates, it is
unfair that we should be asked to deal with
a measure of this importance in a very brief
sitting.

I wish to remind the house again that the
bill would authorize a total expenditure of
almost $5 billion. I recall that in my boyhood days in Ontario two cents bought a
lot of candy, and the boy who had five cents
or ten cents in his pocket was rich. In those
days-the gay nineties-governments dealt in
thousands of dollars, and a million dollars
was almost an unheard-of sum. The total
annual cost of government then rarely exceeded $30 million or $35 million. Even as
late as 1930 the total annual revenue of Saskatchewan was only $13 million. During the

MAY 14, 1953
current fiscal year the government of that
province will spend in excess of $70 million,
and the federal government, as we have been
told, will spend more than $4 billion. Where
this spending is going to end I cannot predict,
but certainly the trend cannot continué
indefinitely.
It is quite in order for members of the
Senate as well as members of the House of
Commons to move an amendment to reduce
expenditures. Honourable senators have always had that power. Also, it is quite certain
and generally agreed that senators and members of the House of Commons can reject a
money bill; but in my opinion only a minister
of the crown may move an amendment to
increase expenditures or to reduce revenue,
if such an amendment would upset the balance
of ways and means.
A short time ago we had in this chamber
a case in point when an honourable senator
moved an amendment to exempt margarine
from items of food subject to sales tax. It
was contended at that time that such an
amendment would be in order and within the
power of the Senate to pass. It is my opinion,
however, that such an amendment would not
be in order, even if by it the tax were placed
on a substitute item, with no actual loss of
revenue.
This whole question Is dealt with in May's
ParliamentaryPractice, l4th edition, at page
753. It seems to me that in the not distant
future this chamber should have a debate
on the question, to establish exactly what
are our powers in that regard. It is true
that we have the same powers as the House
of Commons has with regard to the introducing and passing of bills, other than money
bills, but it is my considered opinion that we
have not the power to pass any bill which
reduces a tax and therefore diminishes the
revenue which the government would obtain
from that tax, and so interferes with the
balance of ways and means.
A great deal of money to be spent during
the fiscal year will be obtained from personal
and corporate income taxes; and as I am
from Saskatchewan, which is a great agricultural province whose farmers pay heavy
income taxes, I want to bring before the
members of this chamber some information
with regard to the income taxes paid by
farmers of each of the ten provinces. The
farmers of Western Canada do not object
to paying income taxes, but they do object
to paying very heavy income taxes when
those engaged in this industry in the other
provinces are not being compelled to pay
their share. I have before me the taxation
statistics issued in the year 1952, but these
cover only the year 1950, the last year for
which figures are available to us.

All the farmers of Prince Edward Island
paid only $5,000; those of Nova Scotia.,
$28,000; and of New Brunswick, $17,000. The
farmers of the great province of Quebec,
which contains about one-third of the population of the whole dominion, paid $50,000.
The contribution of the Ontario producers
was a little higher, namely, $1,889,000.
I
assume that the tobacco growers paid the
greater part. As regards the prairie provinces, Manitoba paid $638,000; my province
of Saskatchewan, $3,467,000, and Alberta
$4,971,000.
Other payments by farmers
were: $704,000 from the province of British
Columbia; and $115,000 from the Yukon
and non-residents. I am using round figures.
That makes a total of $11,904,000 in income
tax paid by all the farmers of Canada. I am
auite satisfied that that amount should be
increased. In 1952, the total was $15 million,
which is not a large sum in relation to the
number of farmers in Canada. Of the 1950
amount Saskatchewan and Alberta paid
$8,438,000; and Saskatchewan and Alberta
together with Manitoba paid $9,076,000. The
remaining provinces paid $2,828,000. Thus,
the farmers of the three provinces I have
mentioned paid almost four times more than
those of the remaining seven provinces. What
troubles me, as it does all the farmers in
my province, is that in 1950 the farmers of
the province of Prince Edward Island-with
its big potato growers-paid in income tax
only $5,000. Many individual western farmers pay twice that amount every year. Out
there we are continually bothered by income
tax inspectors calling from farm to farn.
There are some fifty or sixty of them on the
road all the time. Every time a farmer sells
a load of wheat and gets a cash ticket for it,
a copy of that cash ticket is sent to the
income tax office and put on file, and the
farmer has no way under the sun of avoiding
payment of the tax. That is quite right and
fair. He does not object to that, but what he
does object to is that the other provinces are
not paying their share. We would be glad
indeed to share some of those inspectors with
the other provinces. I am sure, honourable
senators, you would appreciate their calling
upon you and checking up on what you have
done during the year, to make sure that
your income tax returns are made out
properly.
I thought that I should put this on the
record, because there is a great deal of dissatisfaction in western Canada over many
matters of this kind. No one has been able
to convince the farmers out there that Prince
Edward Island farmers should pay only $5,000
and that the farmers of the great province of
Quebec should pay only $50,000. That is all I
have to say on that point.

SENATE
I was dissappointed that at the beginning
of the session we did not set up the Finance
Committee again. I was a member of that
committee for several years, and I found its
work interesting. The committee was always
set up early in the year, as soon as the estimates were brought down. We studied the
estimates carefully for several months, with
the result that when the main bill was
brought in at the end of the session, and we
had only a few hours and sometimes only a
few moments to consider it, as is the case
today, we were pretty well prepared to pass
it because we knew and understood its
contents.
I have gone carefully through this bill and
turned down several pages containing subjects about which I should like to comment.
My intention was to speak to such questions
as the Jack Miner fund, water resources, the
Trans-Canada highway, reforestation and the
anticipated deficit on the Hudson Bay railway. But time does not permit me to deal
as I would like with those subjects.
Being particularly interested in reforestation, I am alarmed by the manner in which
our forests are being depleted. I predict,
honourable senators, that within two decades
very little of our present forests will be left
standing. On visits I have made to the northern parts of both Ontario and Quebec I
have noted that trees as small as one's wrist
are being cut as pulpwood and floated down
the rivers. Some effort must be made to stop
the wholesale cutting down of our forests.
While natural resources such as these are
within the control of the provinces, it is
nevertheless notable that the bill now before
us provides for expenditures by the federal
government to combat the spruce budworm
in New Brunswick, and to stop the run-off
of water on the eastern slopes of the Rocky
These important steps by the
Mountains.
federal government are encouraging.
The bill predicts a deficit of about $365,000
in the current year's operations of the Hudson
Bay Railway. I have visited the fine harbour
at the end of that railway-a harbour which
could shelter the whole British fleet, which
has soft water to a depth of 80 feet and an
entrance of 800 feet at low tide, and which I
believe could be used for shipping at least
four months of the year. My opinion is that if
the insurance rates were lowered to a reasonable extent that harbour would serve as a
great port of entry for imports from the Old
Country, and the increased carriage of freight
on the railway would result in wiping out the
deficit which we are now facing.
Honourable senators, time does not permit
me to go into all these matters as fully as I

should like. And much as I regret the lack of
time, I feel there is nothing that we can now
do to correct that situation.
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable
senators, the honourable acting leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) made a comparison between the income tax paid by the
farmers of the Prairie Provinces and that
paid by Quebec farmers. I would respectfully call his attention to the millions of
dollars paid out to protect the interests of
the western farmer.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: What about the special
freight rates on your feed?
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: The benefits given
to Quebec farmers may run into a few
millions, while the farmers of the West are
helped to the extent of hundreds of millions
of dollars. I would remind my honourable
friend that last year the potato growers of
Quebec and the Maritime provinces got only
50 cents a bushel for their product-not
enough to cover the cost of producing the
potatoes-and no financial assistance was
forthcoming from the government.
But I am entirely in favour of the farmer
getting as much help as he can. Agriculture
in the West is a kind of industry, but in
Quebec, the Maritime provinces and Ontario
it is primarily a family employment. Only
25 per cent of the population of Quebec, as
compared with 60 to 70 per cent in the West,
lives on the farms. I think the amount of
taxes paid in Eastern Canada compares
favourably with the amounts paid in other
parts of the country. After all, it is our
common purpose to try to build a greater and
greater Canada, and we are happy to provide
hundreds upon hundreds of millions of dollars for other provinces if thereby living
standards will be raised and the prosperity
of the nation increased.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

After which the Honourable the Deputy of
the Governor General was pleased to close
the Seventh Session of the Twenty-first Parliament of Canada witih the following speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
It is anticipated that the session now concluding
wil be the final session of the twenty-first
parliament.
During the life of this parliament the commonwealth and the world were saddened by the
death of a great king.
Our young queen is already assured of the
affectionate loyalty and devotion of the Canadian people, and of our deep attachment to the
Crown. The representatives of our country will
leave in a few days to manifest those sentiments
in the Coronation ceremonies.
Coronation Day
will be the occasion of universal rejoicing In
Canada and throughout the commonwealth.
At
the present session you have enacted legislation
to confirm the change in the royal style and titles
agreed upon by the meeting of commonwealth
prime ministers held in London in December last.
Since the present parliament was elected four
years ago we have witnessed many Important
changes in our own country and in the world.
For the first time, the crown is represented in
Canada by one of the sovereign's Canadian subjects.
This is the first parliament in which there have
been members from the new province of Newfoundland.
Four years ago the work of the
Fathers of Confederation was completed and all
Canadians rejoice in the success of the Union and
the fine contribution the people of Newfoundland
are making to the life of the nation.
One of the first achievements of this Parliament
was to vest the Supreme Court of Canada with
jurisdiction as the final court of appeal for the
Canadian nation.
This is the first Parliament entrusted with the
power to amend the Constitution of Canada here
in Canada in matters which are exclusively of
federal concern and at the last session this
power was exercised to provide for an alteration
in the rules for the readjustment of the representation in the House of Commons.
You have made provision for separate representation of the Mackenzie District of the Northwest Territories in Parliament; for elected members in the Northwest Territories Council, and for
increased elected representation in the Yukon
Council.
Special constitutional safeguards have been made
te ensure the holding of federal general elections
within the period prescribed by the British North
America Act.
Three years ago, this Parliament gave its approval to Canadian participation in the military
intervention of the United Nations to resist Communist aggression in Korea.
Since that time

MAY 14, 1953
Canadian forces have shared ln the collective
effort to hait aggression and restore peace to that
unhappy land. Apart fromn the South iCoreans
themselves, our forces have formed the third
largest contingent in the combined strength of
the Ujnited Nations ln Korea and they have fought
with valour and distinction in conformity with our
finest traditions.
Ail Canadiens recognize the
magnitude of the sacrifice of those who have
fought for the sake of peace in the cause of the
United Nations and all have shared the anxieties
of their familles.
The military objective of the United Nations
action ln Korea has been substantiaily achieved.
Having stopped the aggression, the United Nations
has been making every effort to bring about an
honourable armistice, so that the fighting may
corne to an end. Although this problem has not
yet been solved, we rejoice ln the steps taken
to bring about a return of sick and wounded
prisoners and we hope that the renewal of the
armistice negotietions at Panmunjom will be the
prelude to that peace for which the whole world
prays.
On the ICorean question, as on other Issues, we
have at ail times been prepared to consider any
genuine proposais to this end, for our sole atm Is
peace. But we must be convinced by deeds as
weli as words that there is a desire for a permanent and durable peace before it wiii be
prudent or saf e to slecken our preparations to
maintain the strength necessary to deter aggression.
We have looked to the United Nations not only
as an Instrument of collective security but also as
a means for extending human welfare. Through
Its programs of technical assistance to underdeveloped countries, to which Canada has fully
contributed, steps have been taken to Increase
world levels of production, to eradicate or reduce
disease and iiliteracy, and hunger over an ever
widening area of the globe. Closely related to
our participation ln United Nations efforts in
the field of technical. economic and social cooperatIon are the activities in which we have
shared through participation ln the Colomnbo Plan,
which has provided a valuable demonstretion of
practical co-operation within the modemn Commonwealth.
The North Atlantic Treaty hes been ln force
throughout the life of this Parliament. The
alliance of the Atlantic nations has proved its
worth In lessening the risks of aggression ln
Europe by the bufld-up of an Integrated force
for the preservation of peace.
Our country has met promptly our obligations
under the Alliance. A formation from the Canadien Army is now part of the Integreted forces
ln Europe. The build-up of the air division of
the Royal Canadian Air Force is nearing completion. Canadien naval strengrth te steadily Increasing. We have mnade a substantial. contribution through mutuel aid to the armed strength of
our European allies.
We have given attention, ln the closest cooperation with the United States, to the direct
defence needs of the North American continent
and we are actively engaged in Implementing
joint plans to meet any attacks deemed possible
on the scales presently envisaged by the milîtary
advisers of our two countries.
Other Important steps toward world peace were
teken during this period. The state of war with
Germany was terminated by proclamation ln 1951.
Canada has since supported the association of the
Federal German Republic, for the comimon defance, within the European Defence Community,
and with the North Atlantic Treety Organizetion.
The Treaty of Peace with Japan wes also signed
ln 1951, thus making possible the resumption of
normal diplomatic relations with thet country.

After the outbreak of hostilities in Korea my
ministers reluctantly recommended a measure to
vest in the Governor ln Council for one year
certain powers whlch might be necessary to meet
any unforeseen emergency.
This legisiation
expressly reserves to Parliement the control of
expenditures and excludes any erbltrary power
to arrest, detain, exclude or deport any person
or to censor, control or suppress publications
and writings, and contains provisions for review
by Parliament of the exercise of these emergency
powers by the Governor ln Council. Because
hostilities have continued ln Korea this emergency
legialation has haid to be renewed year by year.
The Veterans Charter hes been kept under
constant review and the appropriate statutes
emended from time to time. Pension rates for
disabied veterans, wldows of veterans and their
dependents have been increased substentially. War
veterans ailowances have aiso been Increased. At
the present session you approved a measure designed to provide greater educational opportunities
for chiidren whose fathers died as a resuit of war
service.
Canada's total trade with other nations has
reeched unprecedenteci leveis. The removel of
foreign exchange control and the high level of the
Canadien dollar have demonstreted the basic
strength 0f our national economy.
Through active participation ln multilateral
trade negotiations and by every other aveilable
means my ministers have sought to mnake an
effective contribution to the removai of obstacles
to the free flow of world trade.
Productive Investment bas Increased yeer by
year. Inflation has been brought under control.
The national debt has been reduced every year
with e cumulative reduction ln the dead weight
of its carrytng charges.
Production and national incomne have risen s0
substantialiy year by yeer that It has been possible to finance the vast increase In our defence
effort and et the sae
time make substantial,
reduction ln rates of taxation.
My ministers have been concerned to promote
this national deveiopment along lines designed to
provide a f air share of the national Income to al
the varlous sectors of the Canadien economy.
Agricultural production and Income have kept
et high levels, despite some Inevitable adjustments. To help reduce the Impact 0f price
changes, effective use has bean made 0f price
support legisietion. Floor prices and governmental
action on e large scale were essentiel to prevent
great hardship ln ail parts of Canada resulting
from the United States embargo on Importa 0f
Canadien Iivestock and meat foilowing the outbreak of foot and mouth dîseese in the Province
of Saskatchewan lest year.
At the present session you approved Canadien
participation ln a new International Wheat Agreement and extended the 11f e of the Canadien
Wheat Board.
Great progress has been made in the long-terma
progrem for faderai assistance ln the modernization of our fisheries. The International Convention for the High Sees Fisheries of the North
Pecific Ocean bas been approved and you have
approved the renewal of the Halibut Treaty.
Provision has been made for the Insurance of
fishermen's boats and certain gear.
Throughout the hf e of this Parliament, employment has remaIned et a high level. Coverage
under the Unemployment Insurance Act hec been
axtanded. benefits payable have been Increased
and suppiementary benefits provided during winter
months. At the present session you epproved the
paymant of benefits to insured workers who whiie
otherwise unemployed and entltled to benefit

or injury.

SENATE
Though parliamentary action was required to
settle a dispute between the operators and employees of our railways in 1950, similar difficuIt
