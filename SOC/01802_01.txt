Happily, international relations on this continent, and conditions in Canada, present a

and has borne testimony te the beneficial effects
of the fiscal policies of the Administration, and
of other methods employed to achieve national
recovery. A very definite restoration of ouddence is in itself an auguey of the continuance
of recovery.
A marked increase in -brade and commerce
bas been accompanied by a noticeable improvement in the general econom-ic position. Outstanding features of this improvement have
been an expansion of markets, a revival of
industry, an increase in employment, ascending
government revenues. and upward trends in
wages and prices. In the primary industries
improvement bas been eepecially noteworthy.

There bas been a pronoinced inerease in the
volume of farm products exported. It is the
intention of the Government to continue a
vigorous promotion of the sale of agricultural
products at home and abroad.
The Governmeint's efforts to expand Canada's
trade have been unremitting. Since the last
session of Parliament Ministers of the Crown
have visited Great Britain and other coun.tries.
to participate personally in the negotia-tion of
trade agreements. At the present time, the
Minister of Trade and Commerce is on the
way to Australia and New Zealand to discuss
tie revision of existing agreements.
You will bc pleased to learn that an agreement in principle bas been reached between
His Majesty's Govermnents in the United Kingdom and Canada with respect to a new trade
agreement. The agreement itself will be subnitted for your approval during the present
session.
With tbe assistance and co-operation of the
National Employment Commission, progress has
been made in coping with unemployment and
relief. Relief camps were closed on July 1.
A registration of unemployed persons on relief
lias been completed. Dominion-provincial agreements have been entered into respecting a
Farm Employment Plan, under the terms of
which work bas been provided for thousands
of single homeless men. A Home Improvement
Pl.an lias been put into operation. Despite these
measures, however, and the substantial increase
of employment, the provision for large numbers
still on relief remains a foremost problem.
Measures will be taken, in co-operation wit'h
the provinces, to assist in the establishment of
unemployed young people.
A comprehensive program to meet the serious
conditions created by widespread and intense
drought in Western Canada was adopted during
the summler months.
The amalgamation and consolidation of certain
branches of the public service, for which provision was made at the last session, have been
effected. The board of governors of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the board
of directors of the Canadian National Railways
have been appointed and have entered upon
their duties. Th-rough the purchase of stock
and the appointimenit of directors, authorized by
Parliament, the Governmen-t has assumed a
predominant interest in the ownership, and
an effective control of the Bank of Canada.
Measures will bc introduced ýto provide for
the establishment of a trans-Ca.nada air service;
ta extend the au-thority of the Board of Railway
Commissioners, and ta revise the capital structurc of the Canadian National Railways.
Among other proposed legislative enactments
to which your attention will bc invited, will
be bills to facilitate the making of loans for
the repair .and improvement of rural and urban
homes; to amend and consolidate the Acts which
relate to combines in trade and industry, and
to provide for pensions to the blind at a lower

ABDICATION OF KING EDWARD VIII
MESSAGE FROM HIS FORMER MAJESTY

Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
members of the Senate, the Prime Minister
bas received from His Excellency the Governor
General a message from His former Majesty,
King Edward VIII, dated the 10th of December, 1936, and the instrument of abdication
of Edward VIII, of the same date.
The message communicates His former
Majesty's final and irrevocable decision to
renounce the Throne to which he succeeded
on the death of his father, and sets forth
the instrument of abdication executed by
King Edward VIII on that day.
Originals of the instrument of abdication
and of the message, each signed in His former
Majesty's own hand, were forwarded by command of King Edward VIII, by letter, from
Buckingham Palace, December 10, 1936, to
His Excellency the Governor General.
The text of the instrument of abdication
and of His former Majesty's message was
communicated by cable to His Excellency the
Governor General on the morning of December
10, 1936, and immediately communicated by
His Excellency to his Ministers.
The originals of the message and of the
instrument of abdication are at present in the
personal possession of the Prime Minister.
It is the Prime Minister's intention, unless
honourable members of either the Senate or
the Commons should otherwise direct, to
have them deposited, for safe custody, in the
Office of the Privy Council.
I place in your hands, Mr. Speaker, to be
read to honourable members, and to be retained among the records of this House, a
photostatic copy of each of these documents.
I would ask your Honour to read these documents.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, I have a message from Ris former
Majesty, King Edward VIII, dated the 10th
of December, 1936, which reads as follows:

JANUARY 14, 1937
Fort Belvedere,
Sunningdale,
Berkshire.
After long and anxious consideration, I have
determined to renounce the Throne te which.
I succeeded on the death of my father, and
anc now communicating this, rny final and irrevocable decision. Realizing as I do the gravity
of this step, I can only hope that I shall have
the understanding of my peoples in the decision
I have taken and the resoens whjch have led
me to take it. I will not enter now into my
private feelings, but I would beg that it should
bie remernbered that the burden which constant]y rests upon the shoulders of a sovereign
15 so heavy that it can only be borne in circumstances different from those in which. I
now find myseif. I conceive that I arn not
overlooking the duty that rests on me to place
in the forefront the publie interest when I
declare that 1 arn conscious that I can no
longer diseharge this heavy task with efficiency
or with satisfaction to myseif.
I have accordingly this morning executed an
instrument of abdication in the ternis following:
III, Edward VIII, of Great Britain, Ireland,
and the British Dominions beyond the Seas,
King, Emperor of India, do hereby declare
my irrevocable determination to renounce the
Throne for myself and for my descendants, and
my desire that effect should be given to this
instrument of abdication immediately.
"In token whereof I have hereunto, set my
hand this tenth day of December, nineteen
hundred and thirty-six, in the presence of the
witnesses whose signatures are subscribed.
(Signed) Edward R. I."'
My execution of this instrument has heen
witnessed by my three brothers, Their Royal
Higlinesses the Duke of York, the Duke of
Gloucester and the Duke of Kent.
I deeply appreciate the spirit wbich. bas
actuated the appeals which have heen made
to me to take a different decision, and I have,
before reaching my final determaination, moat
f ully pondered over them. But my mind is
made up. Moreover, further delay cannot but
be moat injurions to the peoples whom I have
tried to serve as Prince of Wales and as
King. and whose future happineas and prosperity are the constant wish of my heart.
I take my leave of tbemn in the confident
hope that the course which I have thought
it right to follow is that which is best for
the stability of the Throne and Empire and
the happinesa of my peoples.
I arn deeply
sensible of the consideration which. they have
always extended to me both before and after
my accession to the Throne, and whicb I know
they will extend in full measure to my successor.
I amn moat anxious that there should be no
delay of any kind in giving effect te the inatrument whicb I have executed and that all necessary steps should be taken immediately to
secure that my lawful successor, my brother,
His Royal Highness the Duke of York, should
ascend the Throne.

TRIBUTE

TO

DECEASED

SENATORS

THE LATE SENATORS SMEATON WHITE AND
CHARLES McDONALD
HonourHon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
able members, it is my sad duty to note the
departure from our midst of Senator Smeaton
White, who was with us for some twenty
years. His name was so closely associated
with the Montreal Gazette that one could
never think of him without at the same time
linking him with his lifework. We who were
of his age, from our college days awaited
his paper every morning for the domestie
and foreign news, and for its interesting commentary on the various activities of the
nation as viewed by the sober-minded conservative element of the community. The
Montreal Gazette has been looked upon by
its readers as a national institution that any
country might be proud of.
I knew Honourable Thomas White, the
talented journalist, and his brother, Richard
White, the managing director, both of whom
in their respective spheres were succeeded by
sons who were worthy of their sires.
Journalisrn and politics are closely allied.
The journalist is naturally versed in public
affairs. It is no wonder, therefore, that three
of the family entered Parliament and therein
pursued a brilliant career. Our colleague,
who came from the manager's desk, was
of a modest and retiring disposition, but
when clothed with the full responsibility of
president of the company and that of a
member of Parliament, he took a greater
interest in the political direction of the paper,
and more and more impressed his views and
his personality upon its policies. He brought
the Gazette to a very high level in the newspaper realm. May I be allowed to state
that many a time while I was in Europe
there were crucial moments when the Eurepean press was filled with news of events
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

developing in its very midst, with accompanying commentaries. When, six or eight days
later, the Gazette came to hand, I was somewhat proud to give the pahn to my home
paper. From afar it seemed to have a better
perspective and a wider vista.
I feel that what I am stating of his life
work would highly please our departed colleague. Senator White's experience, judgment
and advice were valuable to this Chamber
and to the State. which be served in many
a field. To draw loser the East and the
West, he often invited groups of senators to
journey through our industrial centers, so as
to familiarize them with our principal eastern
activities. He was, in the whole acceptation
of the term, a publIic-spirited citizen.
To his relatives and his journalistic family
I know the Senate will join me in extending
our lheartfelt sympathy in the boss they have
sustained.
The Senate would have been happy to welcome the Honourablei Charles McDomnald
since his appointment to this Chamber in
December, 1935. Unfortunately, illness prevented him from, being introduced to His
Honour the Speaker. He was elected to the
House of Commons in 1925 and generously
offered his seat to Right Honourable Mr.
King, the Prime Minister. To the late Mr.
McDonald's family we extend the sympathy
of the Senate.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: I did
not have the privilege of knowing Senator
McDonald, to whom reference was last made
by the honourable leader of this House. He
had been a resident of Prince Albert for
many years, and froma there went to Vancouver. where he was living at the time of
his elevation to this Chamber. We can be
called upon, and we respond naturally ta the
call, to express our sorrow to those who
depended upon him, our sympathy to his
bereaved family and our regrets that his
talents were not available to us, as no doubt
all of us would have liked to have him
associated with this Chamber.
We on this side of the House appreciate
to the full the very generous tribute paid
by the leader of the House to the meýnory
of one of our number, the Honourable
Smeaton White, who for a long time was a
member of this Chamber. It was my privilege to know the late Senator White since
my entry into public life, which took place
a long wohile back, almost thirty years ago.
Naturally and necessarily I followed his
career as a man of considerable prominence
in the business community, as a man who
had an active and exceedingly independent

JANUARY 19, 1937
political life, and still more as one who
achiewved what few if any others have accomplished in our Dominion, the establishment
of a great newspaper.
Senator White took part in many business
activities. And he made it a point, as the
honourable leader of the House bas intimated,
to endeavour to have people of the far ends
of our Dominion know something about, and
develop some sympathy for, great industrial
enterprises of certain sections of the Dominion. In that effort he did a work of great
good, a work that is most necessary in this
country, where our distances are so great and
there is consequently a severance of sympathy
from which smaller countries do not suffer.
I have referred to his attitude of independence in the field, of politics. True, be
always leaned to tihe steady, the solid, what
we like to describe as the conservative point
of view, but he did this certainly from principle and not at any time out of any personal
considerations. He knew a lot about the politics of Canada and the politics of the world.
These were the qualifications that made him
a great newspaper proprietor, in which
capacity, of course, he achieved his greatest
distinction. I do not think it is an expression
of partiality to say that na nation, to my
knowledge, ever enjoyed the services of a
national newspaper of higher calibre and
more outstanding usefulness than was the
Montreal Gazette. As a newspaper it was
the pride of Canadians of all political
persuasions, and especially of all Canadians
engaged in local and international business
affairs. It was a great institution, as it is
still. That institution is largely the work of
Senator Smeaton White. One who effects
such an accomplishment as this for a nation
achieves something that is perhaps not
adequately estimated by the average citizen,
though very essential for the country. To
him of our number who created, built up and
has left the Montreal Gazette we pay a
tribute of sincere respect. I join with the
honourable leader of the Government in
asking that there be conveyed to the business
associates of our late colleague, who I know
mourn him, greatly, and to his relatives, our
united sense of sympathy.
ADDRESS

TO BIS MAJESTY
GEORGE VI

KING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
members of the Senate, I desire to move
the adoption of an Address to His Majesty
King George VI, which will be seconded by
my right honourable friend opposite (Right

5

Hon. Mr. Meighen) and, I am quite sure,
unanimously adopted by this Chamber. The
Address reads:
Resolved: That a humble Address be presented
to His Majesty the King in the following words:
To The King's Most Excellent Majesty:
Most Gracious Sovereign:
We, the Members of the Senate of Canada,
in Parliament assembled, desire respectfully to
extend our greetings upon Your Majesty's
accession to the Throne, and to convey to Your
Majesty and to Her Majesty the Queen the
assurance of our united loyalty and support.
Your Majesty's gracions New Year's message,
sending warmest wishes for the welfare and
happiness of your peoples, and dedicating yourself and the Queen to their service, has been
deeply appreciated by Your Majesty's subjects
in Canada in common with those of other parts
of the British Empire. We believe that, under
the blessing of Divine Providence, Your Majesty
will be vouchsafed guidance and strength to
meet the responsibilities of your noble heritage.
and to fulfil your purpose to strengthen the
foundations of mutual trust and affection
between the Sovereign and his people.
We pray that, amid the confusions of the
world, and the uncertainties of the times, Your
Majesty's Throne inay be established in
righteousness; that Your Majesty's counsellors
may be endowed with wisdom; and that all
endeavours of Your Majesty's reign may be
directed to the well-governing of your peoples,
the preservation of freedom, and the advancement of unity and peace.
There is hardly any call for more words on
my part. Yet I am prompted to draw a
parallel between George V and George VI,
the father and son. Like his father, our
Sovereign is a second son, and like him he
was trained for a naval career. Like his
father, he bas a modest bearing, is unassuming and kindly. Like his father, he has a
marked preference for home life. Like his
father, be is privilieged to have by his side a
loveable Consort. Like his father. he shows
devotion to the public weal and practical
sympathy for the welfare of the people.
The King has been an active president of
many social organizations, chief among them
the Industrial Welfare Society.
The people will love their King and Queen
for those qualities of head and heart which
represent their own ideal and whieh form the
texture of the British character.
Our Sovercigns are blessed with two bright
and most amiable daughters, who bring to
their home constant sunshine. I can only
repeat the ardent prayer expressed by this
resolution: that the Almighty may continue
to guide and bless them through a long and
happy life.
Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

6

SENATE

Riglt Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I rise witli real pleasure to
second the resolution so happily phrased,
and so gracefully supported by the honourable leader of the Senate. Little can usefully
be added to expressions whiclh have come
from the lips of leaders of the other House,
now supplemented by the leader of our own,
in support of the motion to which it is a proud
privilege for us one and -all to give our assent.
I do not think the Prime Minister bas ever
delivered a more impressive, more chastely
expressed or more thoroughly appropriate
speech than the one he made in support of
this resolution in the other Chamber.
We all have in mind, inevitably, the unfortunate circumstances which brought about
finally the abdication of His late Majesty
King Edward VIII and the succession to the
Throne of his brother, the Duke of York,
now King George VI. It does not become
us, in my judgment. to comment unnecessarily, and certainly not to comment critically, upon those events which commanded
the attention of the universe, and led to the
fall of one king and the succession of another
in the greatest Empire the world bas seen.
We can only look back upon those events
with regret that they did occur, and with
pride that the nation was so well guided
through them. We can now think of our
late Monarch with feelings of sympathy, indeed of affection. We make no criticism.
We are proud, though, that within the circle
of his family a successor bas come forward
in whom there is unanimous confidence that
he will assume the high role which devolves
upon him and discharge its onerous duties as
have others of his line in years lately gone
by.
The honourable leader of the Government
has called aptly to our attention qualities
which distinguish King George VI, qualities
w'hich we like to see in Britain's Monarchin our Monarch-because we know they conform to that great constitutional system under
which we live, because we feel they are
essential to the proper working of that system,
and because particularly they were possessed
by his father, of happy memory. We feel
the more reliance because we are assuredand those of us who have had the honour of a
brief acquaintance can add to the assurance
-that he is indeed the successor of his father
in more than a legal sense; le is the beir to
his talents, to his industry, and to his virtues.
With real earnestness and high hope I
second the resolution.
The motion was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved, seconded
by Right Hon. Mr. Meighen:
That the Hon. the Speaker do sign the said
Address to His Most Excellent Majesty the
King on behalf of the Senate.
The motion was agreed to.

THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH
ADDRESS

IN REPLY

The Senate proceeded to the consideration
of His Excellency the Governor General's
Speech at the opening of the session.
Hon. ADRIAN K. HUGESSEN rose to
move that an Address be presented to His
Excellency the Governor General to offer the
humble thanks of this House to His Excellency for the gracious Speech which he bas
been pleased to make to both Houses of
Parliament.
He said: Honourable senators, in rising to
move the Address in reply to the Speech from
the Throne, may I ask for your kindly indulgence to the naturall embarrassment of the most
recently appointed member of this distinguished body in addressing it for the first
time? A new member of this House who
feels greatly, and undeservedly, honoured by
admission to its ranks, is naturally enough
largely unacquainted with its functions and
attributes and with what is expected of him.
To such a one it is a great help to find
some guide to the place that this assembly
is designed to occupy in the political life of
the country. That guide I have been
fortunate enough to obtain by a careful
perusal of the very cloquent speech delivered
last month to the Canadian Club of Montreal
by the right honourable gentleman who
leads on the other side of the House (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen).
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: As the representative of the electoral district of Inkerman. I
am one of the representatives here of the
Protestant English-speaking minority in the
province of Quebec, and as such I was particularly interested in one of the remarks which
my right honourable friend made, as reported
in the Montreal Gazette the following day.
He said:
It is clear that there devolves upon the
Upper House the duty of having special and
peculiar regard to minîority and sectional rights
in Canada, to sece that the majority exercising
its fuill force in the representative Chiamber
where population coitrols is not permîitted ta
ride over the proper rights and privileges of
minorities.

JANUARY 19, 1937

If I might make so bold as to offer a suggestion to the Government, it seems to me
that from the experience of other countries
it is clear that one of the best methods of
further reducing unemployment would be to
encourage building activities, particularly the
building of houses. A good start has been
made in that respect by the home improvement plan which has been brought into effect
by the National Employment Commission,
but something more still can be done, I
think, along those lines. It would seem that
the building industry is one which, with its
collateral branches, employs, and is capable
of employing, a very large number of additional men, and it is not one of those industries which are susceptible of being too
much subjected to the competition between
the machine and the man. You have to
employ men in your building industries, and
you cannot substitute the machine, as you
can in certain other industries.
The gracious Speech refers to foreign
affairs in these terms:
The international situation continues to give
nuch ground for anxiety.
That immediately brings up the question of
what part this country should play on the
international field. We hear two rather extreme opinions expressed on that subject.
The first is what one might call the isolationist point of view. The supporters of it express the belief that, apart from any obligations that we may have as a member of the

eut ourselves off entirely from any external

a few moments to certain features of the
other extreme you have the point of view of

That is no doubt the case. But if honourable members will allôw me to make a personal digression for a moment, may' I tell
them that I have been a resident of the
province of Quebec for now nearly thirty
years and I can truthfully say that at no
time during that period have I ever felt that
I was a member of a minority existing there
merely upon sufferance or the forbearance of
the majority. As the honourable gentleman
who leads on this side of the House (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) has said, I think, on several
occasions when he tas so ably represented
this country at the sessions of the League of
Nations at Geneva, we have solved our
minority problems in Canada and in the
province of Quebec. We have none of those
difficult, dangerous and sometimes tragic
problems of racial minorities which afflict
and embitter the political life of more than
one of the countries of Europe. I think we
may be said to have solved our minority
questions on the basis of mutual respect.
We respect one another in the province of
Quebec; and from respect it is a very short
step to sympathy and understanding. It is
true, honourable members, that I am one of
the representatives here of the Protestant
minority in the province of Quebec, but one
of the very last things that I expect ever to
have to do in this Chamber is to protest
against any infringement of the rights of that
minority.

seems to me that the least we could do under
circumstances of that kind would be to break
off trade relations with the opposing power.
Probably, as is so often the case with extreme views, both of them are wrong, and the
true course for this country to pursue lies
somewhere between them. I do not know
but what the only thing for us to do at the
present time is to follow a policy somewhat
similar to that which Great Britain appears
to be following in Europe-to take no definite
stand, but to wait upon events and finally,
if and when a crisis arises, decide what attitude we shall take in that crisis in the light
of circumstances existing at that time, and in
the meantime to continue our support of t h e
League of Nations. As the gracious Speech
says, let us use all, our endeavours to try to
make it more effective than it has proved to
be in the past.
In the field of international matters one
thing, I hope, is certain, and that is that the
people of this country have no sympathy for
the totalitarian state, whether it cal] itself
Nazi or Facist or Communist. We believe
in the rights of democracy and the rights
of the individual. We can have no part nor
lot with political systems which treat their
nationals as so many sheep to be led to the
slaughter for the greater glory of the state;
which indulge in dangerous international adventures in order to enhance the prestige of
the reigning dictator, or for the purpose of
diverting the minds of their unfortunate
nationals from their economie and political
miseries.

The gracious Speech refers to the extremely
satisfactorrelations existing between the
nations of the North American continent,
and to the visit this summer to Canada of the
President of the United States. Those relations have been still further improved during
the last few weeks by the Pan-American
Conference. and by the visit of the President
of the United States to that conference: and
I think ail those who have read the speech
which the President there made in defence of
the democratie regime and of the rights of
free speech will agree that Canada stands
four-square behind the sentiments which he
then expressed-noble sentiments nobly expressed.
Honourable members of the Senate, in
moving the resolution which stands in my
name I can only conclide by thanking honourable members for the kindness and forbearance with which they have listened to me.
lon. Mr. HUGESSEN.

Hon. GEORGES PARENT (Translation):
Honourable senators, I do not know whether
the opportunity of moving -or seconding the
Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne may be called good fortune. Nearly
thirty-two years ago I had a similar opportunity, and in 1905 I had to perform, in the
House of Commons, the same duty which I
have to carry 'out to-dny.
Therefore this
ooincidence, if I may use the expression, necessarily reminds me that I am no longer a
young man, and, if my enthusiasm lacks somewhat ýin intensity, it might nevertheless be
said, as in the song: "My youth is gone, and
still I sing
Having been involved for so many years
in political events which I have lived through
and been called upon to fight against or defend more often than I wished, probably I
may be permatted-at least I hope so-to make
a few general observations that can be drawn
from the Speech from the Throne.
My task will be all the more pleasant owing
to the fact that the honourable senator from
Inkerman made it easier by the eloquent
speech to which we have just listenpd.
During the pariiainentary recess out Canadian homelandi has heard hardly anything but
words of peace, such as those which were exchanged on the occasion of the memorable
visit of the President of the United Statcs,
wlho was welcomed by the Canadian authorities with all the respect due to his hiigh office.
Conditions, however, are not the same in
Europe. Soon after the victory achieved by
powerful Italy under conditions xvhich on
severail occasions gave rise to fiar of a more
serious conflict, there broke out in Spain a
mnost dreadfui civil war. It is said to be
the first clash between two principles which
we look upon as leiing extreme: Communism
and Fascism. Siich a spectacle gives the democracies some food for thouglt. At a distance it appears to us that these two rigoroi4y eontraeted forms of governient deprive the peoples, the classes, and ndividuals
of all thîeir liberties. Under the dctatorial
regime the right of initiative becoies the
privilege of a military or revolutionarv
oligarchy. And evidence is not lacking that
these two manifestationst of racial pride haet
becone a reai danger for the whole world.
During tihis period of great international
stress it is indeed a relief to witness the
wisdon, the patience, and the diplomacy displayed by the British Government. But it
was in a realistic and heart-breaking tragedy
that Engiînd showed herself still greater in
ber moral strength than in her imperial power.
On that ýparticular subject we had better
follow the discretion used in the Speech from

JANUARY 19, 1937
tihe Throne, which mentions only two events
of momentous import for British institutions:
a k-ing abdicates, andi his ibrother succeeds
him. In the serious decisions which the
British Parliament had to make in these
painful circumstances the British governments
overseas were coneuted. Their co-operation
fittingly strengthened the admirable and firm
attitude of the statesman who, in that tragic
hour, succeeded in saving the constitu-tional
monarchy through the appropriate intervention of a sane democraoy.
The Coronation celebrations will bring that
tragedy to a happy ending when His Majesty
George VI, accompanied by his fami-ly, his
liege lords, and the representatives of ail tihe
nations of the British Commonwealtih and
Empire, will receive the Crown, the honour
of which has been maintained' by the guardians
of the Constitution.
Immediately after this glorious epilogue,
the Ministers from the Dominions will be
convened around the Imperial Council's table.
They will be ca-lled upon to consider with
care and, if possible, to solive so.me of the
serions problems which require their intelligence, their efforts, and the keen sense of
their duties of moral and political solidarity.
Confidence in the wisdom of our leaders is
what we should urge; confidence in the
thorough understanding of the duties that
devolve upon them; confidence also in their
actual knowledge of the legitimate desires
of the Canadian people. Moreover, they will
be in a very fa.vourable position to point out
the benefits of international co-operation and
friendship.
It is a fact that along with
the Mother Country and her sister nations
of the British Commonwealth, as well as the
great American nation !and, other friendly
peoples. Canada has at last emerged victoriously from the economic depression. and
is now on the road to progress. Through
her liberal disposition toward all peoples of
good wil'l, Canada is constantly expanding
her external trade. Without in.creasing taxation, the Government of this Dominion gets
out of its financial difficulties. It will soon
put an end to a long series .of deficits. and
will be able to help the provincial governnments wh-ieh are in a position and willing to
give evidence of their carefulness and moderation.
It is not necessary to stress the question
any further when dealing with a body which
is so well aware of all the activities and
ambitions of a people whose endeavours it
occasionally stimulates by its advice, its
example and its practical encouragement.
However, we must admit that there remains
much to be done as regards the re-establish-

9

ment of the unemployed and the organization
of reasonable relief for the needy. There
are still too many people upon whom Dame
Fortune does not smile. Under an active
and sensible leadership the Employment
Commission has already achieved so much
that it is predicted by some responsible
financial papers that within a year it will
not be necessary to provide grants for the
relief of those affected by the depression.
Perhaps it is too wonderful a result to expect
from this excellent government undertaking,
but it is a compliment and an encouragement
to those who have thus instilled confidence
among the leading classes of our community.
The building industry was the last to profit
by the improved conditions, but now. through
the impetus given by the Government, it is
about to provide work for a particularly
interesting class of workers in our urban dis.
tricts.
The Government is also providing for certain farming communities, especially in the
West, in order to compensate their losses due
to sand storms. A young country like Canada
is possessed of innumerable resources and its
potential wealth is incalculable, but experience should make us aware of possible mishaps against which the Government is in
duty bound to protect the country. These
calamities which have affected some of our
provinces are understood by the province of
Quebec, which participates in those hardships
and pays its share without grumbling, thus
showing that it willingly and heartily associates itself with everything that is Canadian.
This is in reply to those. in the Englishspeaking provinces, who believe in the existence of separatist movements in the province
of Quebec, for which there is less cause today than ever before.
To those who, through kindness or fear, are
interested in the change of ideas in the province of Quebec, it might be well to say that
in all matters of national import the youth
of Quebec acts very much like the youth
in the English-speaking provinces. When
they hear of the wonderful progress of Vancouver they feel glad. The young Canadians
of French origin are proud of their homeland;
they know that the possession of this rich
and immense domain may arouse unholy
desires among foreign people. They realize
that it shall remain theirs so long as they will
defend it against its enemies, inside and outside. But everywhere the young people aspire
to benefit by the resources that Providence
has put at their disposal. In the province of
Quebec they are likely right in suggesting
that their progress is not as well enhanced
by railway facilities as in the English prov-

SENATE

inces. They wish to see their mining resources
actively developed by the opening of new
routes to the north. The laying out of a
line between Lake St. John and Chibougamau
bas been given up. Railways are needed in
Gaspé, Rimouski and certain districts of
Montreal. To compensate for the railways
that have been taken away from them for
economic reasons, why would not the Government help them by promoting their efforts
in that direction? We too, in our province,
fear the effects of human erosion. And it is
not desirable that part of our population
should be lost through emigration. Nobody
need have any fear of these feelings; it is a
natural and brave way to assert one's
patriotism.
No, Quebec bas not and cannot have the
intention of seceding from the other provinces. On the contrary, it desires to participate more actively in public affairs when
it requests a fair share of the administration
for its people. The province of Quebec hopes
for stronger. and, if possible, doser bonds, in
order that the Canadians, whatever their
origin, may direct their efforts toward an
ever greater and more prosperous Canada.
I have the honour to second the motion
which bas just been presented.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, it is as no mere effort
demanded by the formalities of the hour that
I congratulate the mover of the motion whieh
we are now considering (Hon. Mr. Hugessen). Everyone within range of his voice will
recognize that the new senator possesses a
parliamentary style very welcome in this
Chamber, or indeed in any chamber, and bas
elearly made up his mind to ho a working
member of the working section of the Parliament of Canada.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I congratulate
him warmly on the way in which ho bas discharged bis duties. He will not misunderstand me if I add to the other virtues of his
speech which I have mentioned that of
hrevity, only conmenting that this virtue,
unfortunately, is more generally practiscd in
tie Parliament of the country where ho spent
his childhood than in tîat whose portals he
now bas entered.
It is unneoessary to congratulate the honourable senator from Kennebec (Hon. Mr.
Parent), who seconded the motion. He is by
no means a young man in publie life. He is
a war-scarred veteran. Perhaps ho bas net
received as many scars as, for the good of the
nation, he should have received; but that is
Hon. Mr. PARENT.

due purely to his political skill. He needs no
congratulations. He is a gladiator in his own
right.
While I am on my feet I feel like expressing
pleasure at late appointments to this House,
I
inclusive of the mover of this motion.
may be forgiven, possibly, if, contrary to the
general practice, I specify the name of him who
will soon join us from the Pacifie coast. I
believe the appointment of Mr. Farris, now
Senator Farris, is a highly creditable one to
the Government which made it, and that he
will be an acquisition to the Senate of our
country, being a man of ability, energy and
determination to be useful.
It now becomes me to make some comments. They will not be long, because, in
deference to the authority quoted by the first
speaker as to the funetion of the Senate, to
which authority I humbly and modestly submit, we are not primarily a debating assembly.
But we have not yet reached the point where
our work is before us; our main labours are
net yet laid out; so we perhaps can usefully
at
eall attention to some matters which are
this time doubtless in the minds of the great
mass of our people.
The Speech from the Throne touches on
subjects of general concern. I mention first
a reference to the Government's unremitting
efforts ta extend the trade of Canada,
evidenced and no doubt established by the
fact that Ministers of the Crown have visited
Great Britain and other countries ta participate personally in the negotiation of trade
agreements. That Ministers of the Crown
have visited Great Britain and other countries
we are all aware. In fact the excursion this
last summer reached, I think, unprecedented
dimensions: we had but a relie of the GovernNo fewer than nine Ministers
ment left.
enjoyed the Atlantic voyage and peregrinations
through Europe, and we are told they brought
back an amended trade treaty with Great
Britain. Another Minister is now on his way
to New Zealand and Australia. That some
of this is necessary I do net doubt; certainly,
in les degree, usually very much less, it
always takes place. But I cannot join with
that great independent journal of the city of
Toronto which points to the excursions of
Cabinet Ministers over the world as an
evidence of tîat devotion ta duty and that
consecration ta hard toil which so befits a
government.
The Speech then goes on to refer to the work
of our National Employment Commis-ion.
The honourable senator who moved the
adoption of the Addreess (Hon. Mr. Hugessen)
complimented this Commission on its achieve-

JANUARY 19, 1937
ments and stated that along the lines of its
present procedýure it would reach a reduction
af the unemployient tatals of aur country.
I have no fault to find with what the Commission bas done. Previously in this House I
complimented the Government an the selection of the personnel, at least so far as the
Chairman was concerncd, and 1 -have no
criticismn of the other members. 1 do flot
think any man can do more than Mr. Purvis
can do, and what he has done is good. But
I ask you, honaurable senators, is it very
rnuch? Our unemployment figures uniortunately are not reducedý. A program af home
impravement bas been outlined and the
Government, with an ad&mixture of polities
and
swank,
appropriated
$50,000,000
as
evidence of iLs interest in suých program.
Under this plan persans, desiring ta renavate
or improve their homes may borrow from
the banks, if the banks are good enough ta
lend, at a fair rate of interest, by na means
snia]l; and if the banks ultimately lose, then
15 per cent ai the amount loaned will be
taken aver by the Gavernent and the loss
paid. I presumne there will be a littie more
inclination on the part ai banks ta loan when
they know that only 85 per cent oi their loans
need to be good ta enab]e them ta escape
without loss, and possibly the plan will serve
as a primer oi the construction pump and lcad
ta mure building oi homes. I hope iL will.
But I observe that glbhough iL was promulgated well nigh a year aga, the total amount
loaned by banks bas so far reached the vast
sum af $1,000,000. Sa if a maximum passible
loss were suffered by the Goveroment, it
would be covercd by 8150,000.
The Governrnent therciore have a respectable. portion oi the $50,000,000 leit. I wonder
if they ever thought that this appropriation
had any relation in the w*orld ta the real,
actuial surn that their policy represented. The
only criticism I ever made oi the Commission was that its work was surely wit.hin
the compass of the Cabinet itself. I know
there were sorne able men around its board;
I have corne into ýclose contact with them.
Does anybody in this Hausie who knows one
member ai the Government wýell, and mast of
themn iairly well, Lhink that that plan was
beyond, the mental capacity ai this Administration? There is nothing very complicated
about iL; no great vision is necessary for its
gencration. It docs nat seem ta me that the
accomplishment ta date is even worthy of a
place in a Speech irom the Thrane.
Reference is then made ta certain appointments. Na one can complain ai any paucity
ai appaintments, for there bas been a considerable succession ai thern. The board af

il

directars ai the Canadian National Railways have been appointed, as have the board
ai gavernors of the Canadian Braadcasting
Carporation, and many other appaintments
have been made that are nat mentioned here.
We are ta have a revision ai the capital
structure of the Canadian National Raiiways.
On that subject I do flot wish ta intimate
that certain revisians ai a relatively minor
character eannot he justified. Under such
revisians partions ai the capital neyer intended
ta be remuncrative, and which were in the
nature ai praper political contributions ta
great national purposes, may be written off
and assumcd by the State, added ta aur
national debt. But if the writing off goes
iarther and is merely for the purpase ai making the results ai aur railway operatian appear
better than they really arc, then the autcome
is going ta be harmful and will add ta the
dificulties ai Parliament and the burdens ai
taxpayers. How iL will be harmiol the eye
ai a child can sec. I know some men high
in finance have advocated such writing dawn
ai the capital structure ta actual value, as
they caîl it. I diff er from anY prince ai
finance in that advice. I want ta sec the
National Railways represented as they really
are; ta bave their assets calurn and their
liabilities column represent reality and nathing else. If there is a representation ai samething that is nat the whalc, ai something
that does nat give the truc story of the
systcm, then there will be an invitation ta,
extravagance, an invitation ta apply false
policy, and wc arc gaing ta witness bath.
Certain rcmarks oi the maver ai the Address
have led me ta inake comment on other
features ai the Speech. Possibly what I have
ta say at this point rnight appropriately centre
around n passage in the Speech whicha reads
as iollows:
The international situation continules to give
mucli ground for anxiety.
The Septeniber
Assernbly of the League ai Nations gave earnest
consideration to the bearing of recent dev elopments upon the activitiem of the Leagne. and
aý cornmittee was appointed, on which Canada
is rel)resented, ta consider the question of the
application ai the principles af the Coveniant.
1 think I understand that, honourable
senators; I arn not quite sure. It does nat
mean very much. The first sentence does
mean a great deal: "The international situation continues ta give m.uch ground for
anxicty." The Parliament ai Canada is invited ta case ils anxiety by joining with the
League ai Nations in giving earnest consideration ta the question ai application ai the
principles ai the Covenant. For myseli I

pling with the real problem which is bringing
anguish and terror to the world surrounding us
and which now faces Canada. It is quite certain that the condition of Europe is a subject
of anxiety in the minds of a vast majority of
people in this Dominion. I ask honourable
members how many men of thought and
earnestness they have talked with on any subject within the last year who have not at some
point of the discussion inquired what yen
thought about the plight of Europe, about
what was going to happen and how it would
affect this country. Never in my life, in a
state of peace, have I seen the people of Canada so universally concerned about the condition of the world, from the standpoint of
their own interests, as they are just now. It
therefore becomes us at least to meditate together as to whether we are acting wisely and
as mature and intelligent people in the situation which now confronts us.
I have read an address delivered at the
last meeting of the League of Nations by the
Prime Minister of our country. I wish I could
compliment him. as I have done on a late
speech, on the adecquacy of the message which
he there expressed. There are few passages in
it to which I can attach any meaning at all;
if meaning was intended. I do not know what
it was. I should assume that the purpose of
a meeting of the League was to endeavour to
arrive at conclusions for joint action of seme
kind, through the expression of views by
varions representatives of the far-scattered
countries who send their delegates tbere. If it
had not that purpose, if it cannot get sonmewhere along that line, I do not sec how its
existence can be justified. If the Leaigue is only
to bo told by spoke-men for ti
Dominion
that whatever happen. Canada's Parliament
will decide what Canada is to do, then I affirm
that the League is told exactly and absolutely
nothing. Evervon
knows that the Parliament which miav e in existence when the tine
comes to oiake a decision will do so. All the
delegates to the League know that, without
being voucbsafed a message by our Prime
Minister. What I think the League would
like to know from us-and we should like te
have similar information coming from fellow
members of the League-is, what does Canada
feel it ought to do in order to be in such
a position that, if Parliament does make a
decision, such decision will really matter to the
world. If when the hour strikes Parliament
bas nothing with which to give cffect te Canada's policy, then certainly it will net matter
a wiit what the decision of Parliament may
be at that time. If at the close of our Prime
Minister's address some delegate had dared te

League meeting for. I wonder what his answer
would have been.
Yes, the world is in a state of anxiety,
and the subject bas to be reviewed in a
serions, earnest and anxious way. I believe
that some attention te defence, in certain
specific features at least, is being given by
the Administration. Not long ago I saw an
announcement that the Minister of National
Defence would review the whole subject in
a radio broadcast and take the people of
Canada into his confidence as to the general
views entertained by the Government at
this time. That broadcast was to have taken
place, I think, a week ago, but it was never
heard. Why it was not heard I do not know.
But the announcement indicated at least that
the subject of defence had entered the minds
of certain members of the Administration
and that they thought we could not rest just
as we are. It indicates that in those quarters
of the Government the changed attitude of
England, and especially the changed attitude
of pacifist parties of England. brought about
by the experiences of this post-war era, has
had soe
significance.
I observe also that in one arm of our
service. the naval arn. two destroyers which
were purchased in 1928 have been replaced
by destroyers constructed in 1931, or ready
for delivery in 1931, and that two more have
beeni built within Canada. This seems to be
the extent of contemplated preparation in
the naval arm.
I observe also that a reorganization of the
militia, put under way by the late Administration two years ago at least. bas been proceeded with, and that probably a better
organization of that arm of the service now
obtains than before. It nay be reduced, in
But
personnel, but it is better equipped.
when one remembers that the total personnel
was only 3,000, that the militia under training two weeks a year aggregated oily 35,000,
and that all they could obtain in that liglt
training was mercly some appreciation of
the meaning of discipline. one realizes that
the militia arn must mean very little in the
presence of a peril that may any time be
imminent.
There is, though. the air service, and I
see that the Department of National Defence
bas done something in the way of establishing an air base on the Pacifie coast-or at
least has announeed its intention to do so.
I do net know what is the program it may
have in mind. but I close this review of our
actual Canadian defenre position at the
present time with these xvords, that all this
which the Governient bas in mind cannot

JANUARY 10, 1937
possibly be effective or be any consolation
whatever to a Canadian if that Canadian
contemplates a great crisis such as that
through which the world has already passed,
and toward which unhappily it seems te, be
moving again.
I do suggest to the Administration that
there is no such thing as the separate defence
of Canada. It is a mirage. I ar n ot arguing
that there sh.ould flot be some provision
to, help in that way as part of a major
policy, but to lean upon that alone as providing for the security of this Dominion is
arrant folly. It is Ieaning flot on a recd, it
15 leaning on a vacuum-it is leaning on
nothing. There cannot be any independent
defence of this Dominion. We have to look
around, then, and sec by what association
we may best provide for our defence. If
other countries, including our great neighbours to the south,' make up their minds-as thcy have done-that they must go to
vast expenditures to make sure of the safety
of their shores, we cannot very well, slcep
peacefully in our beds feeling that because
we have a couple of destroyers here and a
couple there, and a fcw air bases ' Canada
is secure. We know wc must tic in somewhere; we mnust make up our m-inds in presence of great and mightly factors of the
world situation, and make up our minds very
soon. Some may be disposcd to corne to
convictions on the basis of emotion and
lineage tradition and derivation. Many fine
citizens are govcrned by clements of that
character, and 1 find no fault with them.
Their feelings, indced, I cannot help but
share. But fer my purpose this aftcrnoon
I cast them ahl aside, and I asic honourable
menchers, and particularly members of the
Governmcnt, to refleet on the position purely
from the standpoint of Canada, even assumaing we have no traditions, no overseas alliance,
no Empire affiliations and ne tics of lineage
to constrain us.
I was rather surprised at the statement
made by the mover of this motion in the very
simple outline he gave of our defence problem.
There are, he says, extremists both ways.
There are people who say we should isolate
ourselves-just Iock the door and stay here;
and there are othere, he teclls us, who say we
should be Irnperialist and be in ail Britain's
wars; and the right course, he ventureis to
advise, is to follow a middle road. Well, I
presume the abstract statement cannot be
criticized much, that we should follow a
middle course; but what surprised me was
the definition of a middle course which the
honourable member gave. He said, "If there
is a great war, if Britain is attackcd by a

major power, it would neyer do for us to
supply munitions to her enemy"; and he
suggested the middle course was to refuse to
supply those munitions--that if we cut off
trade relations with him, that would be the
proper and sensible middle course for Canada.
Docs such a course appeal to any honourabie
member? Cast from your rninds ahl feelings
for Britain. I find it hard to cast thcm from
my own, but for the sake of my argument I
arn prepared to do so. Cast aside alI
affiliations, tics, traditions. Does anyone
scriously think it is the part of wisdom for
Canada to stand peacefully and complacently
by and sce the scales go down on Britain's
side, sec that great Empire struck from ber
place as a major power? Wbere would then
bc Canada's defence? May I ask the
bonourable mem'ber who cornes from that
great land, would he like then to be a
member of Parliament compelled to provide
for the defence of this Dominion? If there
is -one tbing certain in this troubled world,
honourabe members, it is that the first line
of defence for Canada-I go further-the first
line of defence for the wbole of this North
Arnerican continent is the British Empire
itself.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: 1 wonder if
the people of this continent woukl feel the
security they feel, to-day -if that uine of
defence weire broken. Not if their action in
1914 is evidence. There are no pairticular
affiliations of lineage or history between Thagl'and and Fraýnce, but Great Britain feela it
is the part of prudence and, of wisdom for
her to guarantee the defence of France. I
wonder if the considerations which so move
Britain ought flot perhaps to move us in
maintaining the strength of Britain for the
defence of this Do.minion.
I (have least patience of aïI with those who
point to the Arnerican Repubhic and tell us
th-at there is a Monroe Doctrine over there
and wc can shelter ourselves cornfortably
under its wîngs. To begin with, the Monroe
Doctrine does not applly to this country. Canada is stili a portion of the British Empire
in the eyes of the American Republic. But
assuming the Monroe Doctrine does appi%',
my first premise is this, that once the
Monroe Doctrine is invokred Canada is in
fact, if not in law, an adjunet, and, a humiliated adjunet, of the American Republie frm
that moment on.
However, assuming such an eventuality
would nceet with a 'hospitable welcome at the

This serions thought I leave with the Administration. We are not living now in the time
we were living in just twelve years ago or at
the close of the War. We then feIt wve could
rest in the arms of what we chose to describe
as collective security. I arn afraid that feelings of discouragement have taken possession
of my soul on this subject of collective
security. The Prime Minîster at Geneva said:
" We are here Vo study the imnport and Vo, see
if we cannot change Vo advantage the terrms
of the covenant." Why, what is left of the
covenant? Trade sanctions are gone, proved
ineffective--declared ineffective by the Prime
Minister, and I find no fault with his declaration. Military sanctions have neyer heen in
existence since fifteen years ago. All that is
Ieft is an aspiration on the part of peaýceloving nations.
The, Prime Minister's best
hope for the destiny of the League of
Nations,'
as expressed in bis own words, is that it may
become a haven of hope for the distressed
peuple of the world. I do not say that is the
only hope for its destiny, but I do say that as
a sectirity to lean upon for the time being
it is gone. and somne other security must be
found. It bas been swept aside by events that

I am not afraid of some dispute away down

it is also tru-e that a vast section of our

Dominion that contemplates isolation and
de.sertion, because such policy wouid split this
Dominion in twain. I know no such policy is

My greatest fear is that no policy of any
kind is very seriously under their review, and
my one purpose is to urge that they develop

kindly reference to the appointment of the
Hon. Mr. Farris.
I need only allude to the speech by the
seconder of the motion, my bonourable friend
from Kennebec (Hon. iMr. Parent). He stated
that some thirty-two years ago he had in, the
Hotue of Commons delivered his maiden
speech on a similar occasion. We appreciate
bis good qualities and we thank him for his
address.
One of the matters mentioned in the Speech
from the Throne is the international situation.
With my right honourable friend, as well as
with the mover of this motion, 1 agree that
the situation is vcry serious, and it bas become
more tbreatening since Germany announced
she had been re-arming. 0f course, everybody

knew during

the few ycars preceding

the

announcement that Garmany was re-establishing her military strength, althougb aIl her
public men denied it. Tbroughout the last
few months, wbile in Europe, I could not help
realizing that Europeans are living very
dangerou.dy. What surprised me most was to
find in the frontier towns and cities of Germany
notices in public and privaýte elevators indicating the bomb-proof shelters wbere the public
could take refuge in case of aerial attacks.
I have read just lately that Great Britain
ias been distributing tbirty million gas masks,

somne of wbich are called "baby masks,"
because even the children may be obliged to
use themn for protection in case of hostile
raids.
Lloyd.'s exelude war risks in their
pd}licies covering property in any part of the
world except the United States and Canada.
1 think we sbould thank Providence that we
are situated in America, by the aide of a good
neigbbour.
My right bonourable friend bas asked wbat
is Canada's duty to-day. If we concentrate
our minds exclusively on Canada, my answer
is that Canada must do what is necessary to
prottet herself by land and by sea. This is
no small undertaking.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Wh-at is the
purpose of this protection by land? Surely
it is not to defcnd ourselves against invasion
frorn the soutb. Yet Canada must put ber
militia organization on a modern footing:
She mnust also, see to the protection of ber
shores. The shores of Canada are as vuinerable
as, and more vulneralyle th-an, the land itself,
be-cause at the present time invasion by land
can come only fromn the soutb, and that is
something we cannot visualize. We do not
admit that it is possible, and we do not think
about it; but we know what may bappen on
our coasts.

15

In 1909 1 stood in this Chamber and
defended, and voted for, a Canadian navy
which sbould assume its sbare of the responsibîlity of defending our coasts. I did so to
the cost of the fortunes of the Government,
wbich, tbrough the political co-operation of
gentlemen who are known to my right b-onourable friend, was defeated ini the province of
Quebec. We know that three years after
plans h'ad been prepared and tenders called
for the building of sbips to defcnd Saint John

and Halifax on the Atlantic, and Vancouver
and Victoria on the Pacific, this policy was
rejected, and that in 1914 the Govemment
was searcbing about the world trying to buy
ships that would defend the cities of Vancouver and Victoria. I stand now wbere I
stood during the debate of 1909, and where I
stood in 1911. Canada must prepare to protect
bcrself against any cuntingency wbicb would

tbreaten ber shores.
My -rigbt honourable friend say6, " Should
we not make up our mind as to what will be
our policy in the event of any cataclysm?"
Well, I draw the attention of my right honourable friend to this situation. We are far
removed from the possible turmoil and conflirt. wbich, if it strikes at ail, will strike in
Europe. It is my ardent bope that the fear
whicb permeates the minds of Canadians, and
of thinkinýg people tbrougbout the world, will
turn out to bave been unnecessary. I doubt
very mixeh that Germany will light the match
which will set Europe atire-and I sa.id 50
when I came back fromn Europe. I have read
the eight hundred pages of Mein Kampf. wbich
is the gospel in every German sehool, and I
know that Germany's design is to extend to
tbe east. and to reach the Ukraine by way of
Poland or Cz-echoslovakia. To succeed in ber

design Germany would need the co-opera-tion
of Italy and the neutrality of Great Britýain

and Poland. Witbout those requisites I doubt
that she would risk a tbrow of the dice. As
I see conditions in Europe. Germany is simply
forging an instrument whicb she may use on
a certain conjunction of events, but which
for the present, at least, bas only a nuisance
value. She hopes that Great Britain and
France will in some way or other be induced
to buy peace. I sec by this morning's paper

that Mr. Runciman says that Great Britain
will not be forced into the position of buying

peace under such conditions. We are ail
apprebensive about th-e situation; yet it may
be that there will be a transformation and
thýat some way can be found to secure the
peace of mind of the people of Europe, who are
near the maelstrom.

Mr. DANDURAND.

JANUARY 19, 1937
I agree with my right honourable leader
that the present is an opportune time for
our naval authorities to discuss with the
naval authorities on the other side just what
we should do in times of peace and just what
we should do in times of war. I have had
the privilege on more than one occasion of
discussing questions like this, not only with
the Civil Lord of the Admiralty, but also
with the Sea Lords. If I had known that I
was going to speak this afternoon I should
have liked to have before me a report that
I made when Minister of Naval Affairs on
my return from the Imperial Conference of
1920-1921. The outstanding features, if my
memory serves me correctly, were somewhat
like these. We had at that time a naval
college-I regret that it is now closed-upon
the efficieney of which we were warmly complimented by the Sea Lords and by the
Civil Lord. I was told that all our cadets
were a credit to Canada and also to the
Imperiil Navy, while serving with it, by
reason of the very efficient manner in which
they carried out their duties. There were
in the Imperial Navy, I believe, about sixtyfive cadets paid by Canada. It was agreed
that eight cadets should be received into the
Imperial Navy every year. It was further
agreed that we should interchange officers
and other ratings and ships with the Imperial
Navy. so that in case of trouble the one
would know how to work with the other.
Then there was a program laid out for some
years ahead. under which Canada, when financially able, was to provide not only destroyers, mine sweepers and submarines, but
also light cruisers.
On the two destroyers that Canada now
bas, the largest gun is 4.7. The Aurora, which
was allowed to rust away at the city of
Halifax, had six-inch guns. Anyone who bas
read naval history must know that destroyers
with 4-7-inch guns could never defend our
coasts against cruisers and battleships with
8-inch, 10-inch and 15-inch guns. Therefore
all that Canada can hope to do now is to
protect ber own coasts in so far as she is
able; and I would humbly suggest to the
Government that if the finances will permit
of it we ought to have, in addition to these
two destroyers, at least a light cruiser on
the Pacifie coast and also a light cruiser on
the Atlantic coast. And I am sure that if our
naval bases were looked into it would be
found they are not in that proper and efficient
state which they should be in, either at
Esquimalt or at Halifax.
Here again it
follows that my right honourable leader
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) is giving sound
31117-2
REVISED

advice when he says the time bas arrived
when the naval authorities here and in London should sit dowh together and decide what
should be done in regard to improving our
fortifications at Esquimalt and Halifax, and
what we should carry there in the way of
munitions, supplies and so on.
There is no use in our giving any consideration whatsoever to the so-called Monroe doctrine. I am, not speaking politically at all.
We are proud to be part of the British Empire. We are not desirous of having war
either on our own shores or abroad, and
everything that we can possibly do will be
done to maintain peace. But let us try to
realize more clearly than ever before the
great advantages of being part of the British
Empire, and work hand-in-glove with ber.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Let us not only
work with her in regard to trade policies,
which have been of such great benefit to this
country, but let us co-operate loyally and enthusiastically with the military authorities and
the British Navy and do what we can to place
ourselves in such a position here that if we
are ever attacked by an enemy Great Britain
and we ourselves will know how to act and
when to move. With the small craft that we
have here now, all we could ever hope to
do would be to drive a few submarines away.
It bas been said at times that in the event
of the Imperial authorities becoming embroiled in another war Canada could remain
neutral. We all know that would be quite
impossible. Supposing we did decide to be
neutral, we should have no means of keeping
enemy ships away from Esquimalt or Halifax.
While I realize that Canada is not committed
to entrance into another European war, I want
to leave this thought with the House, as my
leader did. Let us arouse ourselves and look
into this question of defence. Let us consider
it with the proper authorities and do what we
can to co-operate with them. So far as the
defence of the Empire is concerned, let us
walk arm in arm with John Bull.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon.
GEORGE LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Honourable members, I had no intention when
I came here this afternoon, nor have I now, of
making a long speech. This question of what
should be our policy for the defence of the
Dominion of Canada is the most important
one with which we have to deal. In my opinion
the Parliament of Canada should adopt a nonpartisan policy on this question. I have listened to the honourable leader of the House

SENATE

picturing the difficulties which any party has
to dodge or circumvent in deciding upon a
policy of defence or aggression, or upon any
course which might lead us into war. When
I look back upon the views expressed by our
public men in the period since the last war
ended. I know that it has been fear not so
much of the enemy as of the people of Canada which has prevented them from committing themselves to any definite plan. For any
country which has a party government and
democratic institutions there is only one course
to tale in a matter of this kind, and that is
to sink party differences and have all parties
committed to one defence policy. I think
it is the imperative duty of the Liberals and
the Conservatives in this country to have
their leaders sit down privately and come to
an understanding as to what it is Canada is
willing to do, what it is that both parties will
endorse, so that when a crisis comes neither
party can attack the one that is in power
and make party capital out of anything it
has done for defence. On this great issue the
leader of the Opposition, whatever his party
may be. should be able to say, as Mr. Bennett
said yesterday in connection with another
matter, "I would have done the same thing
had I been in office." If we had such a common policy we could commit the country to
it. But so long as we keep our ears to the
ground and are wondering what effect a certain policy will have upon party fortunes, we
shall never get anywhere.
A change bas come over the m.ind of man
everywhere. In the years since the war this
country and the whole world have resounded
with speeches demanding peace and disarmament. We know that the Conservatives in
England, in common with all the other parties
there. were always opposed to keeping up the
army; there was always talk and more talk
against preparations for defence; the Labour
party in that country never tired of advocating disarmament and the continuance of

similar sentiment in the United States, and
in this country we have heard it expressed
on all hands, by Conservatives and Liberals
alike. What is it that has changed the mind
of the whole world? Every party in England
is now united on a defence program, and
the country is spending untold millions for
defence. What is it that has made the United

of? Something has changed. It seems to
me that the whole of mankind has oriented
itself, and that not in the last twenty years,
but in the last two years.
My own opinion is that there will not be
war for yea'rs. Certainly there will not be
war unless the world goes mad. But the
world went mad before, and it may go mad
again. I recolleet very well how the English
people and Parliament acted, how they hesitated and hesitated before they would commit themselves to any policy when Germany
started the last war. It bas been said again
and again, by thousands and ten of thousands
of people, that had the English Government
of the day taken a firm stand there would
have been no war. At any rate I hope with
all my heart that to-day war is very remote.
The British people have a different outlook
now from what they had before. And so
have the people of nearly every other nation,
for something bas taken possession of the
minds of men all over the world. We in
this country should not sit idle in these
circumstances; we must know what we are
to do. I agree with every syllable that my
right honourable leader (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) has uttered.

COMMITTEE OF SELECTION
REPORT CONCURRED

IN

Hon. Mr. TANNER presented the report
of the Committee of Selection, and moved
concurrence therein.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The Acting
Chairman of the Striking Committee perhaps
has said-if not, I say it for him-that there
are very few changes made in the various committees from session to session, as we generally
leave on the committees the members who
already have been serving. This year we had
only two senators to replace, Senator Smeaton
White, and Senator McDonald, of British
Columbia, who was named as a member of a
couple of committees.
I may say for the information of honourable
members that when we go through the attendance lists of the various committees we sometimes find that some senators have not been
active committee members or have not been
attending committee sittings. If this is due
to illness we hesitate to substitute other
nanes. But I should like to urge members
of the Senate who value their membership
on committees to show their interest by attending committee meetings, for next year
those who are indifferent to the work of the
committees may be replaced by senators who
desire to serve.
The motion was agreed to.
THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH
ADDRESS

IN

REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday con,
sidoration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Hugessen for an
Address in reply thereto.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, I have read the Speech from the
Throne, and it contains many subjects of great
importance to the people of Canada, but I
do not intend to discuss them all.
I want to congratulate the honourable
mover of the motion (Hon. Mr. Hugessen).
Methought I heard the accents of Oxford and
of Cambridge, and maybe of McGill. I desire also to congratulate the honourable
seconder of the motion (Hon. Mr. Parent).
To be quite candid, I was not able to follow
him as closely while he was speaking as
when this morning I read his speech in Hansard. Methought those two honourable gentlemen well represent the historic province of
Quebec. I listened, naturally with pleasure,
to the add-ress of the right honourable leader
of the Opposition (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen).
31117-2j

19

I listened also with pleasure to the answer
of the honourable leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand). I listened too with
pleasure to the address of the first lieutenant
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne).
It seems to me that the four honourable senators from Quebec who have so far taken part
in the debate represent every phase of history
and every shade of opinion in the province.
I think that the right honourable leader of
the Opposition best represents public opinion
in the province of Ontario. Although for a
short time he sojourned in the province of
Manitoba and drank the waters of the Red
river, in thought and action and idea he
really is at home in the province of Ontario.
If this afternoon it appears I an from the
wild and woolly West I want effete Easterners, especially honourable members from the
Central Provinces, to remember the dictum
laid down by the right honourable leader of
the Opposition in an address which recently
he delivered in Montreal. The honourable
mover of the motion said he read the speech
in the Montreal Gazette. I may tell him
that it appeared also in last week's issue of
the Toronto Financial Post. The right honourable gentleman therein stated that one of
the principal duties of the Senate was to protect minority rights. In this connection I
would point out that our representation is
drawn from four great divisions, the Maritime Provinces, Quebec, Ontario and the
Western Provinces, each division being represented, by twentyfour members. We in the
West have not a sufficient number of members in the other Chamber to focus attention
on our problems. Therefore I shall not take
up much time with a discussion of the general
problems of Canada, but shall confine myself
to the problems peculiar to the three Prairie
Provinces. The problems of British Columbia are very much different from those of the
prairies, being in the main similar to. those
of the Maritime Provinces. But we of the
prairies have our own peculiar problems.
Before, however, I touch on the main
theme of the few remarks which I shall offer
for the consideration of honourable gentlemen, I want to say that the question of national defence is agitating the people of
Western Canada just as it is the people of the
other sections of the Dominion. The thinking people of the Western Provinces are disturbed in this respect, not generally for the
same reasons as, say, Ontario and Quebec,
but mainly on the ground of trade. Our
whole wheat production must be sold to the
world, and we realize, as I think our fellow
Canadians do, that our trade routes must be
protected if we are to continue to live as a

Mr.

HAIG.

JANUARY 20, 1937
I want to say to honourable members of
tbis House, and through them te the people
of Eastern Canada, that that situation must
be faced if the problem is te be solved.
Otberwise the West is geing to be bankrupt.
What arxe the fauts? For seven years there
bias been ne crop in~ that country. The story
is told that the clerk in the municipal office
of the city of Regina one windy day put bis
nose eut and said, " I think tbiat is the
municipality of High River going hy." When
hie went eut the next day hie said, "No; it
is the municipality of Calgary." H
ol
tell hv the smell. As a resuit of drougblt,
grasshoppers, or mast, the people have le'st
ail confidence.
How des that affect Eastern Canada? It
affects Eastern Canada in one of two ways.
Lot me give an illustration. A man bad 4,000
biebels. ef whcat. which he was geing te sell
at 85 cents a bushel. In a moment of weaknes I advised hirn te bold. Hie did,' and hoe
sold bis wheat at $1.25 and made $1,6100.
What did he do with the money? 11e spent
$600 on buying things for tbe bouse-furniture,
dishes, and so on-and clothes for himself,
his wife and bis boys and girls. Nearly ail
that moncy xvent into goods tbat were manufactured in Eastern Canada.
That shows
how the East is affected.
Now, honeurable members, what can we
do te solve the problem cf debt? 1 notice
that Sir Jolin Aird, until recently president
of the Bank of Commerce, and Mr. Wilson,
managing director of the Royal Bank, and
a number cf otlier men who bave connections
in the West say that wvorequire an inveýstigatien, sncb as was made in the Maritime
Provinces, for the purpose of finding out wliat
are the facts, and of acting upen those facts.
The repudiation cf debt is a tbing that grews.
We know the history of unempîcyment in the
United States. At first mon or wemen did
net like te go on relief; then they went on
relief, and finally they hegan demanding
certain tbings. It, is the samne witb deht.
When a farmor in Alherta says, "I1 amn net
going te pay my debt-the Covernment will
proteet me,"' you may depend upen it that
the farmers of Saskatchewan and Manitoha
will ho demanding the samne protection. They
say, "We shahl get more reduction if we beld
eut?" The sooner the situation is faced the
hetter for Canada.
I say te tbe heneurable leader of the
Goverement in tbis House, with aIl respect,
tbat bis Government is wrong in anticipating
that the prohlem will ho solved tbrougb
inerease cf trade. It will net. The province
of Manitoba last year ivas behind 84.000.000,
and cveryhody in that. province was taxed

te the limit. Some of the honourable memhcrs
of this House have just received notice of
tbe taxes, and they will get more.
Hon. Mr. MULLINS: One is eneuglb.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The bonourable senator
from Marquette (Hon. Mr. Mullins) says anc
is eneugh. They wiIl get, more. Altbougb
everytbing bas heen taxed te the limit, the
province bas failed. hy $3,800,000 te meet its
deht.
I ask tbe Goveriiment te investigate this
mattcr. I admit that once yen put a commission te work te inveisigate yen are te ail
intents and purposzes hound te accept its
report. If Alberta fails it is going te lay the
blame on others; it will say tbe financial
interest.s of Eastern Canada would not allow
it te carry out its policies.
Therefore 1
suiggest te the honeurable the leader of the
Goverrument, that lie ask his celleagues to
examine into this matter. The Prime Ministers of Saskatchewan and Manitoba have
recentiy been in Ottawa asking foi' I do
net know what. Little thinga will net soixe
the problem.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Wili the
honourable gentleman indicate liow, in bis
opinion, the prohlem is te be solved?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: You must, appoint men
xwbe bave the interest of tbe creditor at hieart;
men whe have the interest et the debtor at
lieart.
You must appoint men who, like
bonourable memnbers of tbis Heuse, bave ne
pehitical axe te grind. A commission of such
mon will find the facts and m.ake a recomnmendation, and the Gevecoment, must pledge
itseif te carry out that recommendation and
insist upon the etbcr gox erruments carr-ving it
eut. That is the oniy way in which the problem will he selved.
It is ail very well te say tliat yen can let
the credit of Alberta go te pieces, or the
credit of Saskatchewan or Manitoba, but if
yen do that yn will affec~t the rest of Canada
as surely as the sun will risce to-morrow moreirng. I want te tell yen that the best constituencies in the province of Alberta, men
and wemen fromn the province of Qncbec,
purely French Canadians, and men and
wemen from tbe English-sp eaking province of
Ontario, were jmt as zealous as any otbers
in electinig Social Crediters. Tbey say, "If
the mon in Parliament do net try te solve
or problem, we will try ýte solve it in aur
own way." I bave ne use fer Social Credit,
but I arn convinced that tbe Social Crediters
will censcript everything produced in the
province and qeou it otside the province, and
boy outside goods and sell te their own people,
paying yen for tbose goeds in Alberta money,

SENATE
whichi is nlot worth anything. If Alberta gets
away with it, Saskatchewan and Manitoba will
follow. True, there roay be a w'hirlwind to
be harvestcd; true. the resuit will be disastrous for tlie people of that province; but do
not forget tbat j i ili ho disastrous also for
the rest of Canada. If you investigate the
record of tlic Canadian National Railways and
the Canadian Pacifie Railway for the last
seico years yoir will find that the falliog off
in their carnings is Iargely due te thec falling
off in the earnings of tlic Western Provines.
The sooner we face the situation the botter.
As 1 say, Sir Johin Aird and Mr. Wilson ani
other mon in high positions in the financial
world are adi ocating the solution I have ment ion ed.
Unemployrnent is a <li.ease, andl once volt
get it no doctor cao cure you. Furthermore,
it affects ei ervbody else. I congratulate the
Government of the honourable the leader upon
its action in increasing the grants for unempîcymient relief when it came into office. Yet
thic city of Winnipeg last year-I want the
honourable the leader of thre Government. to
know tbis--pai<l out more money for unornpîcyment relief than it paid out tie v ear
before. Jo 1935 the eity of Winnipeg paid
out $3,900,000 odd for relief: last year, witbi
ail the inoproveorent iii iodurrtrv, w itb aIl the
improvemient in trado, with al tlie expenditure on impro ernents. thec actual cash paid
out by tlic eity of Winnipeg was more tban
$4,000,000.
The Government hias done two or three
In
thiogs withi respect to unemployment.
what I amn about to sav 1 do not ixant the
honourable leader to think I arn cniticizing
the Governiment. The unemployment probleim
is too qerious te permit of a more remark beiog
construed as criticismn. Whiat lias the Government done with regard to unemployment? It
bas appointed a commission. Thîis commissien bias found that eleven per cent of the
unemployer! are unemploy able. fifteen per
cent are over age, otbcrs are disqualifiod for
other reasoos, and only forty-eight per cent
are employable. What else lias the Government donte? It lias said to the banks, as
the right bonourable the leader of the Opposition mentioned, "We will guaraotoe your
boans up to S50,000.00 for home improvement." But if you have the saine kind of
titie that is required itoder the new scheme
you cao go into any bank in Winnipeg and
get aIl tho money yeni want for the purpose of
improving your property.
About S1,000,000
bas been paid out, but tliat does not solve the
probbem.
Lot me tell you where the problema exists
in the city of Winnipeg. In large part it

consists in the fact that many of the unemployed are people who normally would be ongaged in the building trade or soine of il-s
branches-. I suggest that if you build a bouse
in any eity eigbity per cent *of the cost, of
that bîuilding~ gos int labour. Ther
is a
shortage of houses in Winnipeg; there is a
greater demand for bouses than ever before
in the history of that eity. The sanie is true
of apartmeots. The report of one of our
largest real estate firms bears this out. Two,
thee or four families are oecpying one
bouse. Perhaps you wi]l pardon a porsonal
referonce. My daughiter teaches in a district
xibre there is vs rv boavy unemplornent, and
somentimoes sbe bias in ber classes six or eigbt
cbildren îvbo liv e in one bousýe. .Soinetimes
tboeY reprosent as manv as five families wbo
are livirng together bocause they cannot afford
to rent botter accommodation. Why are new
biouses not being bujît for those people? The
rents are reasonable.
I will tell yon why.
lieder tlio unemplo 'vmeot relief sebeme the
cost of relief is placed on the properties in
ouir cities. Ninety per cent. of the taxes of
fho city of Winnipeg are r.aised on property.,
,and if yen build a hou-e thero to day baîaf

it is niuch more agreeable te sit around on

Z

JANUARY 20, 1937
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Did you ever try it?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, I never did, but I
know from men whom I see on relief that once
they get on it they do not want to get off.
It is very difficult to get then off, beca.use
they say to themselves, "We are now on relief and if we get off we may not be able to
get back again." That is what they are afraid
of.
These matters that have been referred to,
such as the employment of young people in
industry, the improvement of homes, and
figures showing reduction in the unemployed,
are all very good, but they do not get to the
core of the problem, nor within a. mile of it.
And your trade improvement will not help
you a bit; you will have just as many unemployed a year from now as you have today, despite the improvement in trade. Farmers who used to employ as many as twenty
men on big farms are now getting along with
a quarter of that number by doing their
work with machinery. In Alberta this summer
I saw a farmer havesting a section of land,
the work being done by only another man
besides himself, and this farmer told me that
some years ago he used to employ seven or
eight men.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: How can you remedy
that condition?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: You cannot remedy it;
that is one of the issues yen have to face.
But unemployment in our cities can be overcome to a great extent by getting people
occupied on building. You are talking about
having building done by government institutions, and the Government are talking about
a housing scheme under which houses will
be built and rented. That will net solve the
problem, but will only make it worse, for it
absolutely kills any prospect of private enterprise engaging in this work. The way to
solve the problem is to make it worth while
for private builders to build houses. I can
tell you that in the years frorn 1925 to 1927,
for instance, there would be as many as 5,000
men engaged in the building trades in Winnipeg, but I doubt if this last summer there
were more than 50. In these figures I am including men who sell materials, who do excavating, who cut the timber, or who are on
the railroad-s bringing the lumber to the
city-in short, all men engaged in any of the
occupations connected with building.
Now, honourable senators, I have spoken
longer than I had intended.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Go on.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I want to emphasize thi
picture just as I see it. I say to honourabli
members of this Chamber: do not make fun
of the Social Credit Government in Alberta.
The people of Manitoba are very sensible, as
I have mentioned before, but when you are
talking to them they will say: " You fellows
have failed to solve our problems; so we will
try the other fellow." I have asked some of
these people, "Do you believe in this $25-amonth business? " They say, " No, but things
cannot be any worse than they are now."
And conditions in Saskatchewan are net so
good as those in Manitoba.
What we need is to have the debt problem
solved. The Bennett Government put through
the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act,
which helped to relieve some of the farmers'
troubles, but unfortunately it created other

people in many other classes in the smaller

Hon. Mr.
creditors.

ASELTINE:

The

unsecured

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes; they were wiped
right out. And that is a very serious matter.
In Manitoba the Board of Review are taking
a sensible attitude. They are trying to say
that the amount owing to unsecured creditors
should be set off against the debtor's exemptions. I think they are acting illegally, but
that is what they are doing.
Manitoba owes about $125,000,000. I should
think that if the debts of the municipalities
were included, the total amount owing by the
province would be probably about $300,000,000.
I do net believe the province can ever pay
that back. You ask, "Why did they borrow
it?" And I reply, "Why did you lend it to
them?" The surest action a banker can take
to break a man is to lend him too much money.
You loaned those people too much money,
and you put the rate of interest up to eight
per cent-higher than it was in Ontario or
Quebec. Numbers of life insurance companies
said they were getting eight per cent in
Saskatchewan and Manitoba and therefore
they could increase the dividend rate on their
policies. But they forgot that there must be
some reason why the rate was so much higher
in those Western Provinces than in the East.
That reason was that the risk was greater
in the West. In 1882 Moose Jaw and all the
country south of it was diried out and the
farmers had to leave, but in 1910 and 1912

lion. Mr. HAIG.

JANUARY 20, 1937
were put in a negative form. For instance,
he stated that should a conflict arise between
England and some other major power, he did
not think Canada should, send munitions and
war materials to England's foe. His meaning,
as I understood dt, was that in a case of that
kind we should not necessarily sacrifice on the
bloody altar of war the last dollar and the
last man in Canada for the sake of the socalled salvation of other countries, but should
help in any possible way without impairing
the credit of our country for centuries to
come; help, for example, by concentrating on
the supply of war materials to friends rather
than to foes, by producing wheat and other
foods for nations with which we have links
of sympathy, official and traditional. It seems
to me my right honourable friend would have
been truer to himself by drawing more generous conclusions from the remarks of the honourable gentleman from Inkerman.
I particularly appreciated the apt and
spdritedi reply which, was made to the right
honourable leader opposite by my honourable
leader on this side (Hon. Mr. Dondurand).
He quoted a view expressed on the floor of
this House three sessions ago by one of the
first lieutenants of the Goverament of that
day, a gentleman who in 1930 was chief organiser of the party which is not mine, a
gentleman who is not only a very distinguished
citizen of our country, but holds a high military rank. That gentleman is our good friend
the honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. McRae), and I am going to quote from
the speech he delivered to this House on the
first of February, 1934, when he made the
statement referred to by my honourable
leader. I think that, coming from the lips of
a man of his standing, these words possess
much more interest than they otherwise
would:
I ain giving my considered, definite opinion
w hen J say that I cannot conceive of any
developiments which would justify this country
in sacrificing the blood of one single Canadian
on the future battle-fields of Europe.
If my iem.ory serves me right, the honourable gentleman went further in another case
when he stated emphatically he would go to
the extent of raising an army himself to oppose the organization of a Canadiain army to
be sent abroad. That was the most forceful
statement of the kind I ever heard from the
lips of a Canadian statesman, and it seems to
me to be all the more forceful coming from a
man of the political stamp of my honourable
friend from Vancouver. Nobody, surely, can
question his loyabty, even though he made
such a statement.
I think something very important was lost
sight of throughout the de bate yesterdaythe truly Canadian viewpoint. We are wit-

nessing again what I may term a Marathon
of flag-waving and we are hearing all kinds
of protestations about British loyalty. until
it would seem that by some mysterious authority we in this House are barred from using the
word " Canada." A good deal was said yesterday about the British Empire and the
great European powers, but nobody s'emed
to dare even to whisper the name of our own
country. I am proud to declare myself a loyal
subject of His Britannic Majesty King George
VI, who, though King of Canada, happens
to live in another land owing to circum-tances
which we all appreciate, but who since the
enactment of the Statuste of Westmin-ter is
represented in this Dominion bv Hi- Exce1lency the Governor General. But witI equal
pride I declare myself a citizen of Canada,
a country of glorious traditions, high ambitions, unbounded hope.
I an proud to
declare myself a loyal and faithfssl citizen
of this great Dominion, the homelnid whose
soil will nourish my children in ]if and embrace their mortal remains when thev ns-wr
the last call. I fully expected - stiriv some
honourable members would have preferred to
talk a little more about Canada and a little
less about the rest of the world.
I think, honourable members. it would be
not only unfair but dangerous on our part
not to listen to the voice of public opinionand God knows how vehemently it sounds
to-day in objection to our participation in
foreign wars! Let any honourable member
ask the first veteran lie may meet on the
streets of Ottawa, or of any other city in
Canada, whether he would like to see iis son
go through the furnace and the helil which
he himself endured twenty years ago, and
attend to his reply. Let him ask the same
question of the student bodies of our various
universities. Let him ask the editor of Varsity,
the official publication of the University of
Toronto-the very city in which my right
honourable friend lives. I have an apposite
quofation which I should like to give to the
House, but it is too lengthy to quote.
I wish, in passing, to mention a subject which
so far has not even been alluded to in this
debate, a subject which was dealt with at
considerable length last session on ths motion
of my honourable friend from Rigaud, the
ex-Postim'aster General (Hon. Mr. Sauvé).
I refer to immigration en masse and unregulated. At the present time there seems to
have been started, let us say for the sake of
argument, coincidentally in London in the
East and in the vicinity of Letlbridge in the
West, an agitation for unrestricted immigration. The parties interested would pcrcsuade
us that if we adopted their program it would

Hun. ARTHUR SAUVE (Translation):
cie net propose. in my tarit f observations, to go
inte matters thet couici be mxore appropriateiy
discussed on tue occasion of the debate on the
budget, on estinsates or on motions. How,
indeed, cae the question of armaments be
raîsed in a debate on the Speech from the
Throne, whicha makes ne mention of it?
Il is rether strange, theugh, that il is net
nientioncd, wben one remembers that, some
tinte befere tue openinig ef the session, the
Minister of National Defence made certain
statements on the sublect which gave tise te
centreversy. What meaning are we te attach
te bis former loquacity and bais preseut silence?
It is the Governmcnt's duty frankiy te
state tîseir policy in the metter ef deteece
or participation. The Governiment are me
communication wlth the authorities et the
British Empire and with the member powers
et the League ef Nations. They were cernpetentiy represenled at the lest session ef the
Leegue, and I take the epportunity et congretuiating the Geverement leader on his
activity et Geneva. The Goverement thus
being fuiiy appriscd of the situation, hotli
national and international. it is their duty
te bring- forward in full freekness policies
destined te meet this situation. The Geverrnent ere eware ef the ceuntry's rele, of ils
interests, its oblig-ations and is commitments.
They aise know their ewe responsibilities.
They shouid therefere bring forwerd their
poiicy. Il wiil be the epposition's duty te
examine it, te propose ameedmeets, and then
Parliarnent w'iii decide. That wili be the
occasion te take a courageous and loyal
attitude, loyal te Canada flrst.
There is aise a question ef eduýcatien invoix cd. The Gox eernent sh.ould seek te
educate Canadians in Iheir duties et citizensiîip, and it is in peace fimie that citizens wil

JANUARY 20, 1937
learn, to fulfil them properly. In this
campaign of education it will be weii to
avoid abuses and that party spirit which too
often blinds the people instead of enlightening them.
In 1914 we committed grass abuses of
language, theories and expenditure.
I amrn ot yet disposed to take an attitude
other than the ane I honestly toak against
the excesses of the war period. I took it
because I iaved my country beyond ail else.
I stili love it and I arn more and more in
favour of the "Canada First" poiicy.
As I once stated in the presence cf representatives of France and Engiand., the new
world is tired. of the eternal quarrels of the
European nations. Il the aider countries
cannot better understand the new rôle of
Christian civilization. America wiil have ta
teach it ta them. The time wjll corne when
America, who wants peace, will impose its
pahicy.
When the defence estimates are submitted
ta Pariament, the Government should
clearly define and explain ta the people what
they mean by the defence of Canada.
Let us carefully consider these questions in
time of peace. not under the stress of passion.
but in the light cf reason.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable members,
I had no intention of participating in this
debate, but I desire ta make a few brief
observations in order ta satisfy myseif and
settUe my own mmnd. I regret very much that
my honourable friend, who sits opposite (lion.
Mr. Lacasse) should have made the remark
that he did this afternoon. I hope ha wil
take what I say in the spirit in which it is
offered. I list.ened with attention ta tlhe entire debate af yesterday and heard noa reference by eithar cf aur leaders ta the participation of Canada in a war on foreig-n soul, and
I think the honourable gentleman was iiiadývised to bring this feature into the debate
at the present time. It is because of bis
remark that I rise ta my feet.
Everything that was said yýesterday re-lated
ta the defence of Canada as part of the
British Commonwealth of Nations and, as an
integral part of the British Empire. Where
,should we ail be to-day, regardless of aur
national origins, if it wera flot for the protectian that the British Empire bas given us in
t'he past and is giving us to-day? There is
flot a man within the Sound of my voice,
nor a thoughtful citizen of Canada, who
would contend that we as a nation should
not be prepared ta defend ourselves against
an aggressar.
Thera has nat been until to-day any suggestion that Canada wauld take part in a

27

war of aggression, but every thoughtful citizen of this country must know that in order
ta defend itself Canada may -have to go outside its ovin borders. We did that once
before. flot because we cihose ta do it, but
because circumstances compelled us. For twa
and a half years the great repubiic ta the
South of us did everything possible ta keep
fram being invoived in the Great War, in
which it had no personal stake, but in the
endâ it was forced ta take part. It was forced
ta take part, nat by the British Empire, not
'by the world at large, but in order ta defend
the civilizatian w'hich 'had been built up in
that part of the North American continent
south of our southerly boundary.
I am free ta admit that we may find aurselves in su.ch a position in the future that
we shaîl have ta take part in a war on foreign
soil, but I do nat anticipate sucb a thing.
There was not within thie waiis of this House
yesterday a single statement that would lead
any persan Vo believe that because vie viere
preparing ta assume aur share of the burden
of defending aur own land we wauld take part
in a foreign war.
I was very much pleased ta read in the
press about the plans dravin up by the Minister of Defence. Whether or noV ha has gone
far enough, he bas made a st-ep in the right
direction. I think we should rid aur minds
of the idea that wa should not talk defence.
We must caîl things what they are, and must
recognize the situation which faces us and the
rest of the Empire. Honourable membere
viho were presant at the Imperial Conference
a, year ago last summer listenad ta spokesmien fram every unit of the British Commonwealth of Nations, eaeh and every ana of
whom voiced the desire Vo ba sufficiently prepared ta be able ta take part, if necessary,
mn the mutual defence of the Empire. That is
aIl that those of us viha balieve in reasonable
rearinament desire.
Doas anyona suppose
that aîl the elements that go ta make up
the British nation, with its forty-five millions
of people, would agree ta the enormous expenditures that are being made on armaments
if they did noVt believe that the 'Union Government which rapresents them in Parliament
was acting for the defence of the nation, even
though that defence, as deýfence sometimes
does, should make it necassary ta Vake the
offensive?
If the British Goveroment is
rmght, are not thase a.f us hera who believe
in reasonable pTeparation right an aur part?
I tank but a vary small part in the lu.t
war, and I do flot want ta sce any more viar.
I came into contact with a German shelh somevihat early in the game. But I took a greater
part than same who have said they would
raise an army ta oppose men leaving this

JANUARY 20, 1937
The Legislatures have enacted measu-res whieh
have driven all the loan companies and
financial institutions out of the provinces, and
that is one reason why the provinces are in
such a desperate condition. In Saskatchewan,
Alberta and Manitoba, if you lent $1,000 on
a house worth $5,000 you might find after
the next session of the Legislature that your
loan was wiped out. No financial institution
w'hich has a board of directors in Montreal
or Toronto will lend a dollar in the West.
Within the last month I received a letter from
a gEntleman in the East who said he was
advised by a banker not to put out a single
dollar on a mortgage in the Western Provinces.
These provinces are to blame for their
present condition because of the awful legislation they are passing. How can they expect

very satisfactory inquiries. In the United
States the improvements effected apart from

much as ten times those effected through the
loan; so there is every prospect that this
plan will afford a substantial amount of employment to the building trades, which have

Hon. Mr. McMEANS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: And, though I bow
to the superior knowledge of others who take
a different view, I believe that too much
government is one of the great troubles of
the West to-day. M' honourable friend the
junior senator fron Winnipeg alleged, in part
correctly. that the bad condition of the West
was due to the fact that the Fast had pressed
this. that and the other thing upon the
Prairie Provinces, had lent them money, built
railroads, and so on. But my honourable
friend must realize that in 1905 the people
of the Prairies made a great demonstration
of desire for the creation of two new selfgoverning provinces. There is no need of
going into facts and figures to show what
those two new self-governing provinces have
cost the people of the West in years gone
by and are still costing them as a result
of-shall I say?-hare-brained legislation, as
some of us view it. I think my good friend
the junior senator from Winnipeg should
perhaps point out that it would have been a
good thing for the Prairies to have been
tol in 1905 to extend the boundaries of
Manitoba to the foothills of the Rockies
and have one province there governing the
Prairies. Had that been done, millions of
dollars would have been saved to the people
of the great Northwest.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Why did they
not ask for the Hudson Bay also?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: They asked for a
lot of things that we do not need to go into
this afternoon.
Orur sittings of to-day and yesterday have
reminded mre of the frailties of human nature
and partierrlarly of those differences which
go to bring about wars. Among members
of this House there are as pronounced difHon. Mr. MIURDOCK.

ferences of opinion on certain all-important
questions affecting Canada as are perhaps
to be found among people of other lands,
where differences concerning their national
interests are carried at times to the point
of causing stress and even war. I am going
to speak for just a few moments on the
question of war. First, last and all the time.
within the bounds of honour and reason, I
am unalterably opposed to war and believe
that, within those bounds, Canada-yea, and
the British Empire-should exert every means
possible to keep clear of war. But I cannot
agree with some, whom I have heard described
as frenzied patriots, who say that we should
keep out of war at all times, nor do I think
the great majority of Canadians would subscribe to that view. Within the past five
or six weeks we have had a demonstration
throughout the British Empire of what loyalty
and patriotism to the Empire mean. In my
judgment that demonstration, so far as its
thoughtfulness was concerned, was more pronounced than what we saw in August and
September, 1914, when the Great War started
and Canadians in substantial numbers believed that they were to all intents and purposes involved and were no longer neutral,
since Great Britain was at war. I am altogether in sympathy with those who claim that
we should not engage in war under any circumstances, or that Canadians must never
again go overseas to take part in a war on
foreign soil, for I think I know from experience a little about the misfortunes of
war. But may I draw this brief analogy?
I think the most enthusiastic member of a
humane society, a man or woman who would
always go to the assistance of a dumb animal
in trouble, would, if his or ber children were
in danger from a mad dog, without hesitation
take desperate and drastic means to put
that nrad dog out of the way. To my mind
that analogy applies in respect of this question of war.
Canada and Canadians want no more war,
but for the protection of things which we were
thinking about five or six short weeks ago, the
stability and continuity of the British Empire,
our love and pride of race-yes. we were
thinking about those things-tens of thousands
of Canadians were in their hearts ready to
stand firm. Considering the remarkable changes
that have taken place during the last few
years, w-en we have seen the Treaty of Versailles tor into shreds and thrown to one
side, with certain nations apparently relying
upon the view that might is right and getting
prepared by every means at their command
to assert and prove that migbt is riglht, are

JANUARY 20, 1937
we as red-blooded Christian Canadians, proud
of our heritage in the British Empire, going
to stand aside and say we will not even make
reasonable preparations to assist the Mother
Country or other parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations if need be? Nol We are
not going to do any such thing if I know
anything about Canadians or the blood that
runs through their veins.
There are some people in this Canada of
ours who are relying upon the beneficent
position in which they find themselves, basking
in the radiating protection of the United
States, and perhaps some have thought that
great country with its immense navy and army
would not and could not permit Canada to be
assailed by any foreign foe. We are not
built, surely, of such timber that we are going
to sit back and rely upon any sentiment of
that kind. Surely we are going to undertake
to do what may be reasonable and practicable
in preparing, if necessity arise-as God grant
it never may -- to take our place as Canadians and as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations in doing what humanity
expects of us.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Hughes, the debate
was adjourned.
SUCCESSION TO THE THRONE BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 1, an Act respecting
alteration in the law touching the succession
to the Throne.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of the Bill.
Honourable senators, with the
He said:
leave of the Senate I desire to move second
reading of this Bill now. We are cognizant
of the situation which has necessitated this
measure. The purpose of the Bill is to secure
the assent of the Parliament of Canada to
the alteration in the law touching the succession to the Throne set forth in the Act ol
Parliament of the United Kingdom intituled
" His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act
1936." The United Kingdom Act is printed as
schedule two to the Bill which is now before
the House.
To make clear exactly what is intended by
the provisions of His Majesty's Declaratior
of Abdication Act I will read to the House
what was said at Westminster by the Prime
Minister of the United Kingdom on the seconc
reading of the Bill. The Right Honourable
Stanley Baldwin said:

31

The provisions of this Bill require very few
words of explanation from me at this stage.
It is a matter which of course concerns the
Dominions and their constitutions just as it
concerns us. As the House will see, four
Dominions-Canada, Australia, New Zealand
and South AfTica-have desired to be associated
with this Bill. As regards the Irish Free State,
I received a message from Mr. de Valera
yesterday telling me that he proposed to call
his Parliament together to-day to pass legislation dealing with the situation in the Irish
Free State. The legal and constitutional position is somewhat complex, and any points with
regard to that which anyone desires to raise
would more properly be dealt with at a later
stage.
The Bill gives effect to His Majesty's abdication, and provides that His Royal Highness
the Duke of York shall succeed to the Throne
in the same way and with the same results as
if the previous reign had ended in the ordinary
course. It is necessary to have an Act of
Parliament because the succession to the Throne
is governed by the Act of Settlement, which
makes no provision for an abdication or for a
succession consequent upon an abdication. It
is also necessary expressly to amend that Act
by eliminating His Majesty and his issue and
descendants from the succession. This is effected
by subsections 1 and 2 of clause 1.
I desire to draw the attention of honourable
members to the fact that the present Bill
covers only the second subsection in the Imperial Act, eliminating His Majesty and his
issue and descendants from the succesion.
The reaseon why this Bill is brought forward
is to be found in the Statute of Westminster.
Two parts of the statute are interesting, the
preamble and clause 4. The second recital of
the preamble reads:
And whereas it is meet and proper to set out
by way of preamble to this Act that, inasmuch
as the Crown is the symbol of the free association of the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and as they are united by
a common allegiance to the Crown, it would be
in accord with the established constitutional
position of all the members of the Commonwealth in relation te one another that any
alteration in the law touching the Succession
to the Throne or the Royal Style and Titles
shall hereafter require the assent as well of
the Parliaments of all the Dominions as of
the Parliament of the United Kingdom.
It is beoause of this constitutional declaration that the Bill is brought before this Parliament. As honourable senators will see, the
Parliainents of a11 the Dominions were supposed to meet at the same time as the Bnitish
Parliament to enaet similar legislation. The
element of time prevented the immediate
meeting of the Canadian Parliament. What
would have happened in the premises if our
Parliament had waited eight or ten days to
meet and to adopt the legislation mentioned
in the preamble I would not venture to state,
but certainly some difficulties would have
arisen if Canada had not joined in the Act

JANUARY 20, 1937
Now, while I do not oppose the measure, I
want to place upon the records of the House
my views as to the correctness of the procedure
which has been followed. I arn afraid the
Government, or, perhaps, to put the blame
just where it belongs, the law officers of the
Crown, did not give the subject that close,
attentive thinking which it merited. In my
opinion there is no need of this Bill at all. I
know the Government is in good faith in
presenting it, and I intend to support it.
I listened carefully to the argument of the
honourable leader of the Government in this
House, who tried to convince us of the necessity of the measure, and based his contention
upon the Statute of Westminster. I know
the Statute of Westminster is in effect. I
never thought it really registered much of an
advance, if any, and I have always been very
doubtful of the wisdom of solidifying into
words a constitutional position which has
grown through the years, my own faith being
that it would have been better left as it was,
in the form of a constitutional established
practice, than expressed in the form of a
definite and fixed statute. But we have the
statute. Therefore it becomes us to see just
what Canada should do in the presence of the
statute and in the circumstances.
There has been an abdication. An abdication of what? Of the Throne of Great Britain
and the British Dominions beyond, the Seas,
and of the Emperorship-if that is the termof India, by His late Majesty King Edward
VIII. There has been what might be described
as an acceptance by the Parliament of England
of that abdication as a demise of the Crown,
and it has been declared by the British Act
to be a demise of the Crown. That is what
has taken place.
Let us see then where the Statute of Westminster comes in.
There are only two
portions of the statute which have any bearing
on the point at all. First I will read the
recital, upon which, apparently, the honourable
leader of the Government in this House
mainly depends as a justification for this
Bill. I ask honourable members to follow me
closely, because its very presence here has a
significance that I do not think is appreciated.
It is present as a recital, not as a section of
the statute. It is in this language:
And whereas it is meet and proper to set out
by way of preamble to this Act that, inasmuch
as the Crown is the symbol of the free association of the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and as they are united by
a common aHlegiance to the Crown, it would be
in accord with the established constitutional
position of all the members of the Commonwealth in relation to one another that any
alteration in the law touching the Succession to
the Throne or the Royal Style and Titles shall

33

hereafter require the assent as well of the
Parliaments of a.Il the Dominions as of the
Parliament of the United Kingdom.
Now, the leader of the Government says
that by virtue of that recital we ought to
consent, because it recites that it is the proper
thing for us to do as a Parliament when there
is a change in the law touching the succession.
My first affirmation is this-and it is very
vital. There is no change in the law touching
the succession. The law touching the succession to the Throne and to the style and
titles is exactly the same now as it has been
for scores of years. There has not been the
dotting of an i; there has not been a subtraction or an addition. Its identity is precisely
what it was. It is embodied in the Act of
Settlement, and there it is provided that on
the demise of the Crown he or she who
occupies such and such a relationship shall
succeed. As that law stands exactly as it was,
there is no relevancy whatever to this preamble. There is no necessity that can possibly rest on this preamble, for the very
plain, manifest reason that the raison d'être
of the preamble, namely, a change in the
law of succession, does not exist.
Now I come to section 4. I do not think
the leader of the Government sought, if I
understand him correctly, to found any need
for this legislation upon section 4. It reads
as follows:
No Act of Parliament of the United Kingdon
passed after the commencement of this Act shall
extend, or be deemed to extend, to a Dominion

been in another place-that because of that
section we should pass legislation requesting
and consenting. I propose to answer that
contention. What the legislation says is that
if a statute is passed by the Parliament of
Great Britain, that statute is not part of the
law of Canada unless it is expressed in the
statute that Canada has requested or consented thereto. Now, no statute has been
passed by the Parliament of Britain that is
intended to be part of the law of Canada.
The British North America Act establishes
as our monarch the monarch of Great Britain,
the one person fixed by the Act of Settlement as monarch of the Empire, of Great
Britain and the dominions, and of India. If
there is a demise of that monarch there is no
king of Canada. A demise of that monarch

takes place, perhaps upon abdication, certainly upon the acceptance of the abdication
by the British statute. At that moment he
who succeeds becomes monarch, in the same
position xactly as was the monarch he suceeeds. It will hardly be suggested that it
was ever, or is now, within the power of the
Parliament of Canada to change the monarch.
It was not in our power before the British
North America Act, for there was no Canada;
nor was it afterwards. It was not in our
power before the passage of the Statute of
Westminster, and it is not now, after its
passage. That is why there is a preamble.
That is why it is a preamble and not a section of the Act. It never was within our
power, it is not now within our power, and
it cannot be as long as there is an Empire.
So we do not get any further by passing this
statute.
It has already been stated in the British
Act that Canada has requested and consented. I think it has been wrongly stated
there; but it is there; so the British Act is
completely valid anyway.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Does not
the law require only that it should be so recited?
Riight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is all.
Now, I said I thought it was wrongly
stated there. I repeat that. Canada did not
requcst or consent. Canada did not need to
request or consent, it is truc, but Canada
purported to do so by Order in Council.
That Order in Council had no basis in any
statute. It was utterly valueless. The Government bad no authority to express anything
for Canada. The Government cannot express
by Order in Council unless there is a statutory base for it. But I do not want to confuse honourable members. This really does
not matter. The British statute is valid and
is plenary for the whole Empire in the acceptance of an abdication; and the fact is
that if this section 4 ever did require anything, all it required was that this be stated
in the British Act. That requirement has
been met, for it is so stated. That being so,
there is no need of this statute. I think it is
unfortunate that we have it. because it
merely creates a precedent that is going to
be the means of confusion in the reasoning
out of these matters for all time.
There are certain things for which there
shiould be a statute if it is intended by the
British Act that there should be a law applicable to Canada. This is not one of them.
If it had been, I think the appropriate thing
would have been an address from both Houses.
But I say that section 4 does net apply at
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

all, because the subject of the occupancy of
the Throne never was under the purview and
is net now in any sense within the power
of Canada.
There was the recitation that if there was
to be any change in the law of succession it
should not under constitutional practice be
made unless previously there had been request
and consent by the parliaments of the dominions-quite a proper condition. If any change
were made it would be right that we shoulid
act. But the law of succession stands as it
was; consequently there was no need for
legislation at all.
My only purpose in expressing these views
is to put them on the records of the House in
the hope that they may receive the attention
they deserve at the hands of those who would
be vestied with responsibility if another contingency should arise. Had Parliament been
sitting it certainly would have been a wise and,
I think, a proper thing, for an address to be
passed by both Houses. At the present stage
there is no need of anything. But I do net
stand in the way of the legislation.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Would the right
honourable gentleman explain for my benefit
these words in the preamble?
-shall hereafter require the assent as well of
the Parliaments of all the Dominions.
If one or two or three parliaments did not
assent, would it net be possible for the British
Parliament to make a law changing the
order of succession?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In my judgment it would be quite possible to do it with
complete legal effect without the consent of
any dominion at all. The preamble merely
recites what is a proper constitutional practice
if there is intention to change the law of succession. But what I am trying to drive home
is this, that in the present circumstances there
has never been any intention to change the
law of succession, and it has not been changed.
Therefore the preamble is entirely irrelevant
to the whole issue, and the title to this Bill
is all wrong. It wilI be a subject of profound
amazement to constitutional and legal writers
for years to come that we should recite we
are called upon to consent to a change in the
law of succession and in the style and title
of the monarch of this Empire, when there
has been no suih change at all.

scendants, if any, might have a legal claim to

it plain that they never contemplated such a

which interests us, enacts specifically that

reached that point when my right honourable
friend rose. I was simply facing the situation presented to us by the British Government and by the Statute of Westminster,
which necessarily made it important for the
Dominion of Canada to express its opinion.
It was apparently the view of the British
Covernment that the dominions should act
simultaneously on the same lines and in
the same manner as the Imperial Government. It awaited the answers of the various
overseas Covernments. Where the dominion
parliaments were in session they passed the
measure. The Parliament of Canada net
being in session, the Government acted by
Order in Council under clause 4 of the
Statute of Westminster. Surely the preamble
-I admit it is not one of the operative
clauses-contains the view of the British
and the dominions' authorities as expressed
when they sat together and decided to adopt
the resolutions upon which the Statute of
Westminster was based. Of course, the

under the circumstances we are justified in
exercising the powers contained in the preamble and in passing this Bill so far as it
concerns the order of succession. Certain questions may arise, as my honourable friend from
Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) said
when citing the Minister of Justice, and we
know that in past centuries there have been
pretenders to various thrones. If the descendants of the present King predeceased him,
a son or grandson of His former Majesty
King Edward VIII might claim the Throne.
Be that as it may, I feel that in presenting
this legislation we are doing the right thing
by the Parliament of Canada; we are exercising the powers mentioned in the preamble,
and respecting the rights given to the
dominions.

NOTICE OF

INTRODUCTION

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
members, I wish to advise the Senate that
to-morrow I may initiate in this Chamber a
Bill known as the Transport Bill, enlarging
the powers of the Board of Railway Commissioners. This is a Bill of considerable
importance, and one upon which representations from interested parties may be heard.
I would inform the right honourable the
leader on the other side (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) that it was my intention to ask
the Senate to give the Bill second reading
to-morrow. Honourable members would, not
be bound by the principle or principles of the

37

Bill, but would consent to second reading with
a view to sending it to the Committee on
Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours. As we
may adjourn to-morrow evening for a few
days, the procedure I have outlined would
permit interested parties who may be affected
by the Bill to examine into it and to appear
before the committee when we return to
the Senate. I take advantage of the presence
of my right honourable friend to inquire if
ha would agree to the Bill receiving two
readings to-morrow in order that the public
at large may be apprised of its contents.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am quite
agreeable. What the honourable gentleman
proposes is the usual practice here. We get
to committee as soon as we can.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at

GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening of the
session and the motion of Hon. Mr. Hugessen
for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable senators,
in the observations I intend to make on the
subject which bas been before this House
for the major part of the last few days, I
shall pursue a different line of thought, in
part at least, from that which bas been
followed by the members who have already
spoken.
The Speech from the Throne with which
His Excellency opened Parliament, and which
we are now considering, naturally calls our
attention to the abdication of His Majesty
King Edward VIII and the accession of bis
successor to the Throne. We have been told
that the assent of Parliament would be sought
to the alteration in the law of succession,
and that when this was done every member
of the House who wished to express bis views
on the subject would have an opportunity
to do so. Therefore little need be said now
beyond stating that the handling of this
regrettable affair revealed much that is com-

mendable in British character. The Prime
Minister of the Motherland, supported by
the Government, discharged his heavy and unexpected duties nobly and well. The attitude
of the governments of the dominions was
admirable. The press of the Empire, with few
exceptions, conscious of its great responsibilities, lived up to its best traditions. The
unfortunate
during this
attitude
public
episode showed the Christian sentiment of
the people to be widely diffused and sound,
and pointed unmistakably to the path that
should be and was taken.
The Speech says little about the disturbed
condition of the world. and it is not necessary that it should say more. We are all
conscious that we may be on the eve of a
calamity greater than any the human race
has yet experienced. The conquest of the
air has so reduced the size of the globe that
the most distant nations have become nextdoor neighbours, and must live as neighbours
should live, or perish from the earth. The
discoveries and inventions of scientists, which
should and would bring great blessings to
mankind if properly used, bid fair to bring
incalculable woes. The greed of individuals,
the ambitions and hatreds of nations have
become seo intensified that unless a mighty
or perhaps a miraculous change of minds and
hearts takes place Christendom, or at least
that part of it called Europe, may be rushing
to its end.
I fear this is but a faint picture of conditions in the world to-day. The question
naturaly arises: can we do anything about
them, or must we drift like chips with the
tide, or, again, are we contributing a part
to the general disturbance? Of one thing I
am certain: God never created man and gave
him dominion over this earth to bring about
the conditions that now prevail, nor did He
leave man in the d'ark as to what should be
done. The observance of the ten commandments, or of the two to which our Saviour
reduced the ten, would cure the evils that
exist, and nothing else ever will cure them.
Some fourteen months ago I read in the
Financial Times, of Montreal, what purported to be a truc copy of an address delivered by Sir Edward Beatty to the students
of the University of Western Ontario. Sir
Edward began his speech with the following
words:
The world has these past few years beeome
a puzzle to all who dwell in it.
This very sweeping assertion challenged my
attention. If truc, it would show that the
word of God, when He promised to send the
Holy Ghost, the Comforter, Who would teach
Hon. Mr. HUGHES.

us all things and bring alIl things to our
remembrance, had failed. But the statement
is not true, for God's promise bas not failed.
It shows, however, that great multitudes of
educated, intelligent, thoughtful men like Sir
Edward Beatty have failed to apprehend the
significance of God's word and are wandering
in doubt and darkness far from home.
I
say this because we must remember that Sir
Edward is chancellor of the largest university
or school of thought in Canada and that he
was speaking to the students of another university on most important subjects, and no
one questioned the soundness of his statements; on the contrary, many praised them.
The things that are wrong with the world
to-day are much the same as those that have
been wrong with it as far back as history
runneth, and they all came and come from
one root cause, namely, human pride: man's
belief, which he carried and still carries into
practice, that he was and is not a dependent
creature, that he was and is sufficient unto
himself alone, and could and can do without
God, or at the very least that he could and
can supersede or amend God's laws.
Notwithstanding Sir Edward's statement,
the world was never a puzzle to all who dwelt
in it. The Deluge, which wiped out nearly
all the people then living, was no puzzle to
Noah; the destruction of the cities of the
plains was no puzzle to Lot; the plagues of
Egypt and the destruction of Pharaoh and his
army were no puzzle to Moses. Nor were
the Prophets puzzled by the state of the
world in their day; they knew the cause. The
destitution of the prodigal was no puzzle to
the father, nor even to the prodigal himself
when he came to his senses. But, as I see
it, while we remain puzzled no cure will be
effected. Hence the necessity of at least trying to diagnose the case, and thus remove
the cause of our perplexity.
On the 30th of July last I read the following news dispatch in the press:
Prime

Minister

Stanley

Baldwin attributes

many of the world's present troubles to the loss
of young potential leaders in the War.
As I sec it, this statement of the Prime
Minister of Great B:ritain does not go below
the surface of things. It would surely be
interesting if Mr. Baldwin were to teill us
what, in his opinion, caused the War that
caused the loss of the potential leaders. No
doubt the loss of life and property in the late
War was tremendous, but the loss of the
leadership of Christ preceded the War; and
I think I should be correct in saying that
only the restoration of that leadership will
prevent future and more destructive wars;
that is, if Christianity is not a myth and the
Bible a book of fables.

JANUARY 21, 1937
What are the prospects that the rulers of
the world and the peoples of the world will
restore the leadership of Christ? A few years
ago our present Prime Minister publicly
declared that the principles of the Sermon
on the Mount would save the world, and at
or about the same time the ex-Prime Minister, Mr. Bennett, publicly declared that
"only the grace of God cean save the world."
In a truly Christian country such statements
from such men would surely arrest attention:
here they seemed to be taken as mere conventional phrases-and were perhaps so
regarded by the men who uttered them. A
few years ago the important Ottawa Agreements were entered into, and I am told that
God's name is not mentioned in any of the
documents, and that *it was not mentioned
during the Conference discussions, except
once, in an incidental manner, by Prime Minister Baldwin. I think God can be dishonoured, as far as man can dishonour Him,
by being ignored by His creatures.
Leaving our own country and going into
foreign fields, I am told that when the Treaty
of Versailles was being arranged, not only was
God's name not mentioned, but precautions
were taken to see that it was not even
whispered. I am told also that not even once
has God's name been brought up at any of the
meetings of the League of Nations in either
the Council or the Assembly. Canada had and
still has delegates at these gatherings, and they
can tell me, if they deem it worth while,
whether my information in this regard is
correct. The League of Nations is not the first
Tower of Babel that man has tried to build
without consulting God. Man's repeated
failures do not seem to have given him wisdom.
Again I ask, what are the prospects for a
change?
Coming back again to the home field, I find
some things which I think should be mentioned
here and now. Sir Herbert Holt, giving evidence before the commission inquiring into the
operations of the Dominion Textile Company,
stated upon an investment of. $500,000 the
company had in thirty years paid to its
shareholders $15,000,000 in dividends, and had
added $10,000,000 to the value of the original
investment. As is well known, while the company was doing this it was telling the public
that it could hardly make ends meet; that
if the protective legislation which enabled it
to make these enormous profits were reduced
it would have to close its plants and go out of
business. The Financial Post was one of the
leading newspapers that defended this wholesale exploitation of the public by saying, for
instance, that for every three dollars paid in
one year by the company to its shareholders

39

it paid two dollars in taxes to governmente,
besides employing hundreds of men and women
in its factories.
I remember reading some years ago, in English and Canadian publications, that the sultans of Turkey had been in the habit of farming out to their favourite underlings the
collection of the taxes, permitting these underlings to get all the money they could out of
the impoverished people if they gave the
sultans, their masters, part of it. The practice
was very severely condemned, and the inference was that nothing ýlike that would
ever be allowed in any British country.
During the session of 1931, to be exact as to
the date, the then member for Labelle, speaking in the House of Commons, saidi that the
Montreal Light, Heat & Power Company,
which is an amalgamation of several companies, could legally pay to its shareholders
no more than seven per cent in dividends,
but that it got around the law in this respect
by splitting its stock fourteen times, and was
therefore paying to its shareholders 98 per
cent. In the same speech he stated the
Sun Life Insurance Company was paying its
shareholders from 50 to 75 per cent in
dividends on its share capital. These are
samples of the kind of thing that is going on
all over the world. and has brought the
capitalistic system into disrepute everywhere.
It is the kind of thing that has bred Communism, Socialism and aIl the other "isme"
that plague humanity. It is the horse-leeeh
that is never satiated; and in its own destruction it may bring down civilization as we
have hitherto known it.
Is there any force or power in the world
that can meet and overcome this insatiable
spirit called mammon? Doubtless a united
Christendom and an unimpaired Christianity
could meet the challenge. But there is no
such thing as a united Christendom.
And has the spirit of mammon affected
Christianity? "If the sait lose its savour,
wherewith shall it be salted?"
Quite recently I read a book written by
Adolf Keller, professor at the universities of
Zurich and Geneva, entitled "Religion and

contains the substance of a series of lectures
given by the professor at Princeton University,
has been highly praised by many English
writers and by several of the book reviewers
of two continents. It gives a lengthy and
detailed account of the multitude of opinions
held by the distinguished theologians and
professors in the leading universities of the
world, particularly in Germany, upon every
conceivable aspect of Christianity, even upon
its very foundation, namely, the divinity of

Christ. Professor Keller seems to lean to the
idea that this wholesale confusion is a good
thing, because he says, at page 50:
Every new discoveryin religion
-involves a personal interpretation which may
be denied by the next generation.
But this dons not discourage him at all. He
seems to regard it as something admirable,
and all making for spiritual progress. Apparently "the faith once and for all delivered
to the saints " has gone into the discard.
Again, an Englishman of high standing and
an able writer, Dr. Oldham, who has done
considerable preparatory work for the World
Conference of Christian Churches (other than
the Catholie Church) to be held at Oxford,
England, in August next to consider the
union or reunion of Christendom, bas issued
a booklet entitled " Church, Community and
State," calling attention to our unfortunate
divisions and the weakness thereby entailed.
He says. on page 19:
The Christian Church throughout the world
confronts a situation resembling in marny
respects that in which in the early centuries
it stood face to face with the pagan might of
the Roman Empire.

Mohammedanism, but the danger was averted,
perhaps by Providence. Now I think Providence is using the British Empire for a great
purpose, and if every part of that Empire
does its duty we can go forward with confidence. Every nation, like every individual,
has its responsibilities. and as I sec it Canada
could not be more fortunately placed than
she is. But God forbid that we should shirk
our responsibilities!
I am confident that
the Empire to which we belong will never
wantonly attack any nation, and that the
stronger we are the greater is the world
security. Of course, it is alarming to know
that the world is now spending fourteen
billions of dollars a year on armaments,
whereas it spent only four billions for the
same purpose in 1913 when preparing for the
world-shaking conflict that followed.
The
pace to keep the peace may be killing, but
we cannot help it, and if we place our cause
in the hands of Providence and do our duty
we cannot go wrong.
When a strong man arnsed keepeth his court:
those things are in peace which be possesseth.
But when a stronger than he come upon him,
and overcome him: he will take away all his
armour wherein he trusted, and will distribute
his spoils.

And on page 30 he says:
The differences found within the same confession are in many cases deeper than the
differences whieh separate one confession from
another.

I think Great Britain could well say to her
children:
He that is not with me, is against me: and
he that gathereth not with ie, scattereth.

He deprecates tbis and calls it a "disquieting
discovery," but on the next page lie says:
These differences are the result in many
insitances of the variety of finite minds, and
are consequertly an enrichment of the Ciristian
fellowship, inasmueh as they add to the fullness
of appreiended truth.

I am whole-heartedly with the idea that
has been advanced by some members who
.have spoken in this debate, that the leaders of
the two major political parties get together
and agree upon what our duty to ourselves
and to the Empire is, and then go ahead. I
shall give such a suggestion ail the support I
can, and I feel that I should be unworthy of
my citizenship if I did not do so. The outlook
is certainly threatening, but of one thing I am
certain: that no matter how the storm rages,
the Church established by Christ, and with
which He promised to remain till the end of
time, will not be entirely overwhelmed while
the earth is inhabited by man.
At the present time there is in Eastern Canada a movement which appears to be practical
Christianitv at its best, and which may mean
much in the years to come. It shows that
human nature has many redeeming qualities and will respond to sincere, disinterested
leadership.
I refer to the adult education
movement carried on by St. Francis Xavier
University, Antigonish, Nova Scotia. About
twenty years ago the professors of this university. under the guidance of Bishop Morrison,
began to organize the people of the diocese
into study groups, the basic idea being that

So there you are. Why in the name of common sense hold a World Conference of
Christian Churcbes to heal differences that
are an enrichment of the Christian fellowship
and add to the fullness of apprehended truth?
It is beyond me, but I suppose there must
be something in it. Either that or the whole
world bas gone crazy at the same time.
At the present time Communism, Nazism
and Fascism are at daggers drawn, but they
may come together, because they all belong
to the same fiamil-the totalitarian
or
absolute state. Their differences just now
are of degree rather than of principle. Of
course, a difference in degree may make a
large difference in practice. Should they come
together for malevolent purposes, as is quite
possible, a divided Christendom and an
impaired Christianitv will offer but a feeble
resistance.

TRANSPORT BILL
PIRST READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND introduced Bill B,
an Act to establish a Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada, with authority in respect of transport by railways, slips, aircraf t
and motor vehicles.
H1e said: Honourable senators, I informed
tbe Senate before we adjourned that this Bill
was in preparation and would be brought before the House as soon as we resumed our
sittings. As it may be necessary to send the
Bill to a committee, I would ask leave to
deviate from our usual procedure and make a
few remarks in explanation of the measure
now, with a view to having it put down for
second reading to-morrow. If my right honourable friend is not ready to have it taken up
to-morrow we can postpone the second reading
to a later date.

43

As the Bill itself states, this is a measure
to establish a Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada, which Board shall have
authority in respect of transportation by railways, slips, aircraf t and motor vehicles.
This Bill marks a further step in the development of transportation in Canada and the
regulation of the same. As some honourable
members of the Senate will recali, there was
a time when transportation in Canada was
largely a monopoly of the railways and there
was no regulative control of rates, with the
resuit that public demand for a regulative
policy became somewhat insistent. In 1887 the
United States Interstate Commerce Commission was granted regulative powers, and in the
following year, when Canada had about 12,500
miles of railway in operation, the Railway
Committee of Privy Council was given certain
powers having to do with rate regulation. This
arrangement seemed to satisfy public requirements until about 1898, when it became increasingly apparent that some other method
was required to cope with the rapid extension
of the railways and of trade and commerce;
and after extended investigation, the Railway
Act was amended in 1903 to provide for the
organization of a Board of Railway Commissioners. The Board, established in 1904,
is given very wide powers over railways constructed under federal autbority, as well as
over railways constructed under provincial
authority, when such railways are declared by
Act of tbe Parliament of Canada to be a work
for the general advantage of Canada, while
purely provincial railways connecting with or
crossing Dominion railways are subject to the
Board with respect to ail such connections or
crossings.
At first the membership of tbe Board was
resgtricted to three commissioners, but four
years later, in 1908, when our railway mileage
was approximately 25,000, tbree more were
appointed and the usefulness of the Board
increased by an arrangement permitting it to
be divided into two sections, each of which
could sit independently, the decision of cither
section being, under the Act, the decision of
the Board.
To the Board were transferred the powers
previously exercised by tbe Railway Committee of Privy Council, and tbe Privy Council
now does not deal with railway rate matters
except -on petition to the Governor in Council
to review a particular judgment or o-rder of
the Board, with respect to which there is also
appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada upon
questions of jurisdiction.
We have now more than 42,000 miles of
railway in Canada, and in recent years the
railways bave continued to serve the best
interests of the Dominion as a whole in cir-

SENATE

cumstances of great difficulty and under conditions which now demand the most careful
consideration of Parliament.
When the Board of Railway Commissioners
was first established, the railways, as already
pointed out, exercised a virtual monopoly in
the field of transport. The competition from
inland waterways was negligible, the automobile was a novelty, and the aeroplane
not yet a practical reality. But the railways
no longer enjoy that monopoly. Rapid development of the internal combustion engine
and its application to trucks and buses as
well as automobiles, and the consequent demand for motor bighways, plus the intensified
competition for traffic due to the depression,
have brought the highways of the country
very prominently into the transportation picture. It is unnecessary for me to remind
honourable members of the effect of truck and
bus competition upon railway revenues.
The construction of the Welland Ship Canal
has also hai a marked effect upon Canadian
transport in that it has permitted entrance
to Lake Ontario and Upper St. Lawrence
waters of the larger type of Great Lake
carriers wbich formeriv made their terminals
at Lake Erie ports. This has had the effect of
releasing from the bulk grain trade the smaller
vessels formerly operating between the Lake
Erie ports and Montreal, and these boats in
turn ha ve cut into the package freight traffic
at one time enjoyed by the railways buit at
the present time competed for by the railways, the bighways and the waterways, under
conditions as to regulation and non-regulation
which it is the object of the proposed Bill
to deal with. so far as the jurisdiction of
the Dominion Parliament may extend.
In recent years there have been great
adv.ances in aerial transport, and the present
rapid development of Canada's northern
mining fields bas been largely due to the
adaptation of t'he aeroplane to commercial
purposes. Heretofore this form of transport
has been largely confined to fields not served
by any of the older methods of transportation,
but the development of flying has now reached
the stage where transcontinental services are
about to be established on regular schedules,
and je that way the aceropline becomes an
active competitor in a field heretofore regarded as the peculiar province of the railways.
It is of course recognized that each of the
four agencies of transport referred to-the railways. the highways, the waterways and the
airways-have their own particular field of
usefulness, and neither the railways nor Parliament would desire to hamper in any way
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

the development of any competing service in
any legitimate direction. What is complained
of, and what the Bill before us is intended te
remedy if possible, is the unfair competitive
situation which has come about by reason of
the fact that heretofore only the railways
have been subjected to the jurisdiction of this
Parliament, as represented by the Board of
Railway Commissioners, and the time has
now arrived when we must reconsider the
position and decide whether we shall continue
the close measure of supervision and regulation as enforced upon the railways, and not
applied to the other competing forms of transport, or whether we shall, as far as it may
be legally possible to do se, exercise a general
measure of regulatory supervision over all
transport agencies alike.
The extent to which the railways are subject to control and regulation under the
Dominion Railway Act will possibly be a
matter of surprise to the average citizen. The
Board exercises a definite measure of control
over the setting up of railway companies,
which must be in strict conformity with the
provisions of the Act, and also over the agreements for the sale, lease or amalgamation of
railways, the interchange of traffic, running
rights, and the operation of insolvent companies. It also exercises certain powers over
the construction of railways authorized by
Parliament. and their location, and no railway may be opened for traffic except by
]eave of the Board after inspection by its
officers.
The operation of the railways, their equipment, and the speed of trains, even the use of
the whistle, are all subject to the regulations
of the Board, and, the precautions for the protection of the public are also subject te its
direction.
But the aspect of the regulative authority
of the Board of Railway Commissioners bearing more particularly upon the matter before
us is that with respect to traffie, tells and
tariffs, and the power vested in the Board
by the Railway Act to fix, determine and
enforce just and reasonable rates, also to
change and alter rates as changing conditions
or cost of transportation may from time to
time require. The Board must also sec to it
that there shall not be unjust discrimination
or unreasonable preference practised against
shippers, consignees, or localities. It is provided that all freight tariffs shail, be filed
with and be subject to the approval of the
Board before they can become effective, and
the Board is at all times prepared te receive
and consider complaints for the public with
respect te the same.

FEBRUARY 2, 1937

provincial or foreign trade, or upon a Dominion highway. The Board may by regulation prescribe standards of design and operating efficiency of public commercial vehicles
to be licensed.
Part IV also provides that where provincial
legislation is enacted for the regulation of
motor transport the Board may, if so authorized by provincial law, undertake the
administration or enforcement of such scheme
of regulation; provided that the Board considers that such scheme can be co-ordinated
with the regulation of interprovincial and
foreign trade and transportation upon any
Dominion highway, as provided in this Act.
Part V places the regulation of harbour
tolls under the Board and provides that all
tolls shall, under substantially similar circumstances and conditions, be charged equally
to all persons and at the same rate, and that
there shall be no reduction or advance in
such tolls with respect to any particular person or port. The Board may disallow any
tariff of tolls, other than statutory tolls,
should it consider the same to be unjust or
unreasonable, and if the Board should be of
opinion that any statutory tolls should be
amended or rescinded it shall be the duty of
the Board to recommend the same to the
Minister of Transport for such further action
as the Minister may deem fit.
Part VI provides that contract carriers may
make such charge or charges for the carriage
of the goods of any trader as may be agreed
between the company and the trader, but any
such agreed charge shaH require the approval
of the Board, and the Board shall not approve
such charge if in its opinion the object to be
secured by the making of the agreement could,
regard being had to all the circumstances,
be adequately secured by means of a special
tariff of tolls under the Railway Act.
Part VII provides for regulation by tihe
Board, if it be deemed necessary, of brokers
carrying on business by any means of transportation, in which event no broker shaH
sel], or offer for sale, transportation, or make
any contract, agreement or arrangement
regarding transportation in respect of which
transportation tolls are charged otherwise
than in accordance with the provisions of
this Act.
The Act provides that breach of its provisions shall constitute an offence punishable
by fine of not more than one thousand
dollars nor less than one hundred dollars.
The Act is not to come into effect in any
unless so licensed.
Part III similarly deals with aircraft, and respect until proclaimed by the Governor in
Part IV with transportation by highway by Council, and any part of it may be separately
public commercial vehicles engaged in inter- proalaimed.

The Railway Act also places the regulation
of passenger tariiffs under the control of the
Board and regulates the operations of express,
telegraph and telephone companies, and, as a
court of record, may impose substantial
penalties for disobedience of the orders of the
Board.
The Railway Act also obliges every railway, telegraph, telephone or express company to prepare and furnish to the Board,
and in accordance with its classifications, complete statistical information, and complete
information with respect to all such operations
must also be furnished the Dominion Statistician.
From these provisions of the Railway Act
it will be seen that the railways as a class
are subject to strict regulation and control
by the Dominion authorities, and in the provincial field provincial railways are also subject to the railway acts of the various provinces, which contain regulatory provisions
somewhat similar to those of the Dominion.
In addition to all this the hours of labour,
rates of pay and working conditions of railway employees are subject to agreement between the workers themselves, as represented
by the railway brotherhoods, and the companies. In this way the operation of the
railways is assured under conditions making
for the safety and convenience of the travelling and shipping public and ensuring as well
a proper standard of living for railway
workers and their families.
As to the Bill itself a brief explanation will
be all that is necessary at this stage.
Part I provides that the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada shall hereafter be known as the Board of Transport
Commissioners for Canada, and provides that
in all relevant legislation the name of the
new Board shall be substituted for that of the
present Board.
Part II provides that the provisions of the
Railway Act relating to tolls and tariffs and
joint tariffs, and the making of returns, and
the powers of the Board with respect to tolls
and tariffs, and for the enforcement of the
orders of the Board, and for the review of
and appeals from such orders shall apply to
transportation by water, and to every person
engaged in such transportation. It provides
that the Board may license ships to transport
passengers and goods from one Canadian port
to another Canadian port, either directly or
by way of a foreign port, and no vessel may
engage in such carriage of passengers or goods

SENATE

The object in introducing this Bil in the
Senate is to expedite consideration and to
afford opportunity for ail interested parties to
be heard. With this object in view it is
suggested that the Bill should be referred to
the Railway Committee of the Senate in
order that those interested may appear before
it and make any necessary representations.
That is the statement which I desired to
place on Hansard for the convenience of
honourable members.
The Bill was read the first time.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I hope the
Bih will be printed and distributed to-morrow
morning, and I particularly hope the explanation given to-day will appear in the
Senate Debates some time in the morning.
I have observed that the Senate Hansa.rd
comes out after the Commons' necessities
have been looked after. That may be ail
right as a general rule, but this is a most
important measure and I hope the Debates
Office will see to it that we get our official
report in good time for to-morrow.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will now ask
that the Bill be placed on the Order Paper
for second reading to-morrow.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Sometimes after
a long night's session the report is somewhat
delayed because honourablie members may
wish to revise their speeches, but as this
bas been a short sitting I join with my right
honourable friend in expressing the hope
that we may have the Senate Hansard early
in the morning.
The second readdng of the Biil was placed
on the Orders of the Day for to-morrow.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at
3 p.m.

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: I am
quite agreeable to the motion. Indeed, were
it not for the fact that the Bilhl is of major
importance, and honourable senators would
1.ike to study it between now and to-morrow,
and particularly to study the very excellent
and very useful explanation which my honourable friend has just given, I would suggest
that the second reading be taken now. I
think we in this Chamber do not consider
second reading of a Bill such an affirmation
of its principles and purposes as to bind
us to implement those principles or purposes
in law in some form or other; not in the
same degree, at alil events, as in the other
House.
It is most appropriate to introduce the Bill
here, and I congratulate the Government,
and particularly its honourable leader in
this House, on doing so. We have the means
and the time to give the public every opportunity to be beiard. I venture to predict the
public will not be slow to avail itself of the
opportunity, for many and most important
interests are affected by this measure and
are apprehensive with respect to it.
I view the Bill sympathetically, hoping it
can be made practicable. I only regret it cannot be given second reading now, so as to be
referred to committee witlhout delay.
On the motion for second reading I propose to offer a few comments, more with the
idea of asking honourable members of the
sta.nding committee to keep them in mind
while the various clauses are under review.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I take it for
granted that the Bill will be distributed this
evening or early to-morrow. If we give it
second reading to-morrow, I need, only say
that it will be with the clear understanding that by so doing the Senate does not
commit itself to whatever principle or principles are involved.

proposes? I thought I heard something about

FEBRUARY 3, 1937
1913 in the statement that was read. In my
opinion we ought to know what we are voting
on.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Next sitting of the
House.
Consideration of the report was postponed.
CANADIAN

AND BRITISH INSURANCE
COMPANIES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 3, an Act to amend
the Canadian and, British Insurance Companies Act, 1932.
He said: Honourable senators, the object
of this Bill is to permit the Treasury Board
to authorize deposits by certain provincial
companies less than the ordinary deposits
required by the Canadian and British Insuirance Companies Act. The companies affected
are companies applying for registry restricted
as to territory to one or more of the provinces of Canada and incorporated by provinces which require even provincial companies
to have Dominion registry. I understand
that the province of Nova Scotia, for instance, has no insurance department and
requires of companies a licence issued by the
federal Department of Insurance.
The amendment contained in the Bill is
similar in effect to subsection 2 of section
14 of the Insurance Act, Chapter 101 of the
Revised Statutes of 1927, which was as
follows:
Where a licence limited to one or more of
the provinces of Canada is granted, the Treasury
Board on the report of the Superintendent
may authorize the acceptance of an initial
deposit less in amount than in this section
provided.
This subsection was omitted in the revision
of the Act in 1932.
While the amendment now suggested is of
general application, the necessity for it has
arisen from an application recently received
from a newly incorporated farmers' mutual
company in the province of Nova Scotia.
That province since 1918 has required provincially incorporated companies to hold
Dominion licences or registry as a condition
of their transacting business within its
boundaries, and, under the provisions of subsection 2 of section 14 of the Act I have
just quoted, licences were issued to four
farmers' mutual companies with deposits less
than $50,000. The operations of those conpanies have been of the greatest benefit to
the farming communities in the province
which they serve, and it is believed that an
equal opportunity lies before the newly in-

47

corporated company. It is desirable, however,
that it should be under supervision which the
province looks to the Dominion to provide.
Obviously this supervision can be given only
if facility is provided for licensing under the
Dominion Act, and a requirement of a $50,000
deposit from such a company as a condition
of licensing is prohibitive.
The legislation of the province of Nova
Scotia to which I have referred was first
enacted by Chapter 15 of the Statutes of 1918
and now appears as Chapter 187 of the Revised
Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1923. In that statute
the term "Insurance Act" is defined to mean
"The Insurance Act, 1917" (Canada) and to
include any amendments thereof that may from
time to time be made. This definition was
amended by Chapter 32 of the Statutes of
1936, as follows:
(a) "Insurance Act" means "The Canadian
and British Insurance Companies Act 1932"
(Canada), or "The Foreign Insurance Companies Act 1932" (Canada) and includes any
amendments thereto that may from time to
time be made.
Section 2 of Chapter 187 provides that:
(1) No insurance company shall do or carry
on in Nova Scotia any part of its business of
insurance unless and until it is thereunto
licensed under the Insurance Act.
Should any other province in the future
legislate to the same effect as the province of
Nova Scotia has donc, the amendment contained in the present Bill will probably be
necessary for the purpose of accommodating
small provincial companies, operating in the
province, for which a $50,000 deposit would
be prohibitive.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I am strongly in favour
of this Bill. It appertains only to smaller
provincial companies whose operations are
confined to the province where they are incorporated, and applies to them only in any
province which, having no insurance department of its own, legislates that such insurance
companies and all others operating within its
borders must hold a licence or certificate of
registry from the federal Department of Insurance.
It is important in that it paves the way
still better for admission of provincial companies into the supervisory sphere of the
Dominion, and it may lead to abandonment
of the present multiplicity of our insurance
jurisdictions. We are trying to reduce the
inordinate expense of multiplied governments
in Canada. I do not know of any means we
can take more likely to bring this about than

48

SENATE

the wiping out of duplicate departments where
they are manifestly net necessary. Were it
possible for the Dominion to step ont of the
insurance supervisory field, then of course the
onus would be on the provinces; but clearly
that is not possible. for the Dominion alone
can supervise federal companies. Consequently
it is quite clear such econonies can be effected
only by the witbdrawing of provincial supervisory organizations. I do net know how many
provinces have tbem. but I think about seven
or eight. and certainly sema of those provinces
are continually knocking at the faderal door
for loans. This amendment may help to
suggest again that these duplicate services
be discontinued, for undoubtedly the object
to be attained by them could be fully attained
by our own Insurance Department.
The motion was agreed te, and the Bill
was read the second time.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
ratding of the Bill.
He said: With the Icave of the Senate, I
would ask that this Bill be now read the third
time. Nova Scotia is verv much interested
in its prompt enartment because there a
company wbich is alrady organized is waiting to obtain its licence.
The motion was agreed to. and the Bill
waS rad the third time, and passed.
WEIGHTS

AND

MEASURES

BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 4. an Act to amend, the
Weights and Measures Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this Bill is te clarifv a situation whichl has
been

obscured

y

some

deci>ions

in

lower

courts.
Section 82 of the Act provides that proceedings shall be taken before any justice of
the peace, but if the penalty exceeds $50 the
case must be heard by two justices of the
peace. Subsection 2 of the section provides
that the provisions of the Criminal Code
relating te summary convictions shall apply
to all proceedings "subject to the provisions
of this Act." In 1935, by Chapter 48, 25-26
George V, several amendments were made
te the Weights and Measures Act, by which
penalties for offences in several cases were
greatly increased. For instance, the minimum
fine for the use of an unjust scale by a corporation was increased to $100.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Owing to the phrase in subsection 2, "subject to the provisions of this Act," the question was raised in a prosecution against a corporation whether or net a stipendiary or police
magistrate had jurisdiction te hear these
offences "where the minimum penalty was
$100," although in all provincial offences and
practicl
tIiall offences against federal statutes
a -tipendiary iagistrate has the same authority
as two justices. Under the Criminal Code,
by the interpretation section, a stipendiary or
police magistrate has the same authority as
two justices.
For the purpose of settling any confusion
as to the jurisdiction of a police or stipendiary
magistrate to hear cases under the Weights
and Measures Act, it has been deemed advisable te add to suîbî.ction (b) of section 82 the
underlined words, "a police magistrate, stipendiary mtagistrate, or any other person
having the power or authority of two or more
justices of the peace, having jurisdiction in
such district, county, or place." This amendment is in the exact words of the interpretation section of the Criminal Code, and
gives te such court officers the same jurisdictien under the Weights and Measures Act as
they have under the Criminal Code.
This proposed amendment relates merely
to a detail in legal procedure and is desirable to fit in with the general organization of
the provincial police courts, so that these
courts as at present organized may dispose of
all offences under the Weights and Measures
Act, no rnatter vhat the size of the penait.
It bas been suggested by the Law Clerk
of the Senate that the amendment might very
weil be effected by simply referring to the
language of section 604 of the Criminal Code.
I am disposed to adopt his suggestion.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I bave no
objection te the second reading. The Bill is
to be submitted to committee, is it not?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It will go

FEBRUARY 3,1937
DOMINION FRANCHISE BILL

MILITIA PENSION BILL

SECOND

SECOND READING

moved the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND
second reading of Bill 5, an Act to amend the
Militia Pension Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
very simple Bill, and I fear that if I read the
memorandum which I have recevied from
the department it ýmight confuse the matter.
The purpose of the amendment is to authorize
pensions granted under the Militia Pension
Act to the widows of officers, and the compassionate allowances to the children of deceased officers, to be paid in equal monthly
instalments in arrear instead of in advance.
Under the present practice, if a beneficiary
d'ies there is hardly ever any reimbursement
of that portion of the pension which covers
the period subsequent to death.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Does it not mean
that the payment, instead of being made a
year in advance, will be made a month in
advance?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

No.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Previously
the money was paid yearly in advance; now it
is to be paid monthly in arrear.

THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Instead of
being paid in adivance the money will be paid
at the end of each month.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: In that case would it
not be better to transpose the words "in
arrear" and place them after the word "payable"?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not think
it would be an improvement.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Perhaps the honourable gentleman will tell us what "in
arrear" means. Is payment made after the
month has gone by?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. It is
just the opposite to "in advance."
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As the Bill consists of but one clause, which is accepted by
the Senate, I move the third reading now.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.

READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 7, an Act to amend the
Dominion Franchise Act.
He said: Honourable senators, Parliament
last year amended, the Dominion Franchise
Act in such a manner as to suspend the revision of the general electoral lists throughout
Canada for one year. A general revision of
the lists is a very costly procedure, and it
suffices that lists be prepared for by-elections.
I have seen it stated, I think, that last year
the cost of the lists for the two or three byelections was only $12,000 instead of $200,000
or $300,000.
The Bill before us has the same effect as
the Bill of hast year, namely, to postpone the
revision of the existing lists for one year. It
is in exactly the same terms as the Bill of last
year.
I move the second reading.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

DAIRY

INDUSTRY BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 8, an Act to amend the
Dairy Industry Act.
He said: The proposed measure will in
no way affect the principle of the Dairy Industry Act. It involves three minor amendments, the first of which prevents the placing
of foreign matter in milk or cream. Previously the restriction applied only to milk.
It is now intended to include both milk and
cream.
The second amendment has to do with an
amendment passed last year. Because of its
position in the measure of last session the
penalty which applied was much too severe.
Consequently the section passed last year is
repealed, and it is re-enacted under section
3 of the present measure.
The last section of the Bill refers to a
number of items such as storing, packaging,
handling and transporting of dairy products,
which may be controlled by regulation in the
department.
With these explanations, I move the second
reading of the Bill.

TRANSPORT BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill B, an Act to establish a Board
of Transport Commissioners for Canada, with
authority in respect of transport by railways,
ships, aircraft and motor vehicles.
He said: Honourable senators, I gave an
explanation of this Bill last evening when the
first reading was taken.
Hon. .Ir. DANDURAND.

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, the Bill before us, in so
far as drafting is concerned, appears to me
to be a very excellent product. One needs
to read only a few pages to realize that from
that point of view the preparation has been
careful.
I fancy the committee will net
have much work to do in scrutinizing the
phrasing and general construction of the
measure. It is going to have a great deal
te do, though, in determining whether or not
much of the Bill is practicable.
I wholly sympathize with the principle and
purpose of the measure, namely, to bring about
some uniformity of operating conditions as
between the railways on the one hand and
the other means of transport on the other,
there now being four of these in place of
the one which we had about twenty-five
years ago. Motor-vehicle transport, lake transport and transport by air have taken an important place and certainly are in severe conpetition with our railways. Of course, ever
since Canada became a nation we have had
lake transport, but a quarter of a century
ago it was not nearly as competitive as it is
now. The opening of the Welland Canal
and the improvement of vessels have made
a difference.
The railways take the position that the
thoroughness and severity of regulation to
which they must submit should have some
counterpart in respect of their competitors,
or that the restrictions and supervision which
apply to them should be removed.
One need only have regard to the question
of lake transport to see the great difficulties
we shall immediately encounter in dealing
with this measure. Those of us who are
more or less patriarchs will remember that
twenty years ago resolutions were repeatedly
introduced in the House of Commons calling
for the inclusion within the control of the
Railway Commission of ships and lake transport. I have not a very clear recollection
of the arguments pro and con. I fancy they
would be more clearly in the mind of the
right honourable gentleman from Eganville
(Rigbt Hon. Mr. Graham), who, on at least
one or two occasions, spoke for the Government of the day in opposition to such a
proposal. It may be that the evolution of
lake transport and the change in the law as
respects the definition of coastwise shipping
have brought about a situation in which regulation will be practicable. I do not know.
I should think it would be very difficult.
We have to keep in mind the fact that
here in Canada our railways have to meet
the competition not only of Canadian coast-

FEBRUARY 3,1937
wise shipping, but of American shipping as
well. I do not know just whether the terms
of the Shipping Act are yet in force, or wholly
in force, under which Canadian shipping was
given a chance as against American shipping.
We all know that no Canadian boat can
travel between two American ports, no matter
how it seeks to cover up the coastwise nature
of its operations, but all through the years
American boats have had the full privilege
of competing with our boats in lake transport.
Certainly there is a section of Canada which
will insist on the benefits that have always
accrued to it by reason of this competition,
whether fair or unfair, and it will look with
some dubitation upon measures which appear
to control a competition the severity of which
has been of great advantage. Further, it is
one thing to have a regular schedule tariff,
approved by the Commission, in respect of
freight traffic on our railways, but it is quite
another thing to have a tariff applicable to
water-borne traffic, because that traffic is a
matter of negotiation from hour to houralmost moment to moment-and depends upon
return traffic and many other things besides
the cost of carriage.
These considerations will certainly be very
much in the mind of the committee during
its review of this Bill. I only hope-and I
feel sure that most honourable members of
the House will hope-that the provisions set
out here will work and that something will
be done to even up conditions. It may be
that in order to give the railways a chance
to meet their competitors there will have to
be a period of less interference with rail
traffic and rail traffic conditions.
As regards motor-vehicle competition, which
also is sought to be brought under the Bill,
I am entirely in favour of some method of
control. It is true that the Bill, in seeking
to provide for licensing of vehicles in freight
or passenger service and for control of rates
and. travel conditions in respect of such
vehicles, is intended to apply only when they
are used interprovincially and upon Dominion
highways, that is, highways owned by the
Dominion, whether within a province or not.
In that sphere the Dominion undoubtedly has
jurisdiction, but, as it must keep within its
strict constitutional prerogatives, I am very
doubtful whether it is going to control motorvehicle competition effectively. After all,
the bulk of motor transportation is intraprovincial, not interprovincial at all, and while
intraprovincial traffic remains uncontrolledas perhaps it must-not much can be accomplished by seeking to control that modest
amount of traflic passing from one province
31117-4

51

to another or shipped from any province out
of Canada. The latter class, too, is clearly
under Dominion jurisdiction.
As to air traffic there would not seem to be
anything at all in the way of making feasible
a measure of supervision from the national
standpoint. Air traffic is interprovincial and
international, and, if the decision in the
Aeronautics case still carries respect in this
country-as I earnestly hope it does-is a
matter within federal jurisdiction.
I have read the various sections of this Bill
and the illuminating introduction given yesterday by the honourable leader opposite. I
am prepared to contribute my part fully and
vigorously in committee, and I assure this
House and the Government that I will do. so
sympathetically. I have some fears.
Hon. WILLIAM DUFF: Honourable senators, although we were given to understand
yesterday that before we met to-day we should
have an opportunity of studying this Bill B,
which is entitled "An Act to establish a Board
of Transport Commissioners for Canada, with
authority in respect to transport by railways,
ships, aireraft and motor vehieles," I might
say that I am not in the advantageous position of the right honourable leader on the
other side (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), who
has a copy of the Bill before him, for I
have not yet seen a copy. Like my right
honourable friend, I am very much interested
in this Bill and I should prefer to have an
opportunity of studying it before we give it
second reading. However, as the honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) mentioned last
evening, we have a somewhat different procedure here from that in the Chamber which
I left a few months ago, with regret.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: No, no.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I do not want to try to
establish a new principle here; so I am quite
willing to allow this Bill to go to committee,
without protesting against the fact that I
have not even seen the measure, so long as it
is understood I am not committed to its
principle.
After listening yesterday with a great deal
of interest to the splendid presentation made
by the honourable leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) it seems to me,
honourable senators, that this is perhaps one
of the most important bills ever brought
before Parliament. It is one in which every
citizeu of Canada is very much interested. In
introducing the Bill the honourable leader of
the Government said:

SENATE
As the Bill itself states, this is a ieasure
to establisli a Board of Transport Commnissioners for Canada, which Board shall have
authority îi respect of transportation by railways, ships, aircraft and motor vehieles.

In other words, this Bill affects every man,
woman and child in the country-every business interest and every private individual. It
seems to me that iregardless of how much we
may wish to see Goxvernment measures passed
in this Chamber, we should not commit ourselves on this very important Bih until we
have given the people of Canada a chanee to
express their views upon it.
The leader of the Government also said
yesterday:
'Tlis Bill marks a further step in the
development of transportation in Canada and
the regulation of the saie.
I wonder, honourable senators, if Parliament and legislatures in this country are not
perhaps going entirely ton far. It looks to
me as if we have altogether too much paternalism. Almost everything that people do
to-day must be regulated by Parliament or
by legislatures or by some board or commission, and not much latitude is left to the
private individual or business man as to how
he may conduct his own affairs. So far as
I am concerned, I object to that. I say that
I know more about my business than any
legislture or commission does; I say that the
business men of this country who are directing corporations or private enterprises are in
a better position to know how to run their
own business affairs than are the members
of any board or commission, whether at
Ottawa, Halifax, Saskatoon or anywhere else.
We are going entirely too far when we take
the control of private corporations out of
the bands of individuals who bave invested
their mýoney in them, and wben we say by
legislation that before they tan do such and
such a thing they must obtain the consent
of such and such *a board.
I have no particular objection to the setting
up by Parliament of a commission to control
the rates charged by railways for freight and
passenger traffic. My reason !for saying that
is that the taxpayers of this country are the
real owners of the railways. By contributions
of one kind or another, through subsidies or
the endorsement of notes or the guaranteeing
of bonds, the people of this country have
become the owners of the railways, and consequently I cannot see very much objection
to the regulation of rates that the railways
may charge. As to the new ventures in air
and motor services, I am not quite satisfied
that Parliament should interfere in the same
way.
Hon. Mr. DUFF.

My principal reason in rising this afternoon,
honourable senators, is to urge that all who
are interested in a certain part of this Bill,
that referring to shipping. should be given
an opportunity to make their views kniown
before the Bill is finally passed. I want to be
fair, and t.hat is why J am agreeing to the
Bill being given second reading now, s0 long
as it is understood we are not committed
to its principle.
I cannot see, honourable
senators, how Parliament or any legislature
or any board or commission such as this
legislation proposes to establish can deal with
rates to be harged with respect to the Great
Lakes or coastwise shipping in this country.
My right honourable friend referred to a
measure with regard to rates on the Great
Lakes that was dealt with in the other
Chamber some fifteen years .ago. le made
some reference to the right honourable senato- froin Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham).
He did not look at me, but he may renember
that although I was a supportcr of the Gove.rnmtnt which introduced the ieasure, I had
sufficitnt courage to prot c against it, and the
Bilxwas diropped.
I say that the Government bas no right
to demand that men who invest their money
in ships and shipping. on the Great Lakes,
the Atlantic or the Pacific, should be subject
in the matter of rates to rulings by a board
in Ottawa. Let me repeat that I am not
objecting to regulation of railway rates, for
the taxpayers of this country have invested
hundreds of millions of dollars in the railways, and not only the present generation
but generations for a hundred years from now
will be paying for the construction of those
railways. But a man who has a ship or a
fleet of ships, whether he is operating on the
Great Lakes or on either of our coasts, is in
a different position from that of the railways.
Why should Parliament or any legislature set
up a board with power to say to such a man,
or to anyone who bas invested money in
ships, that certain rates must be charged?
Or why should any board have authority to
tell a shipper of goods that he is not free to
make any bargain he tares to make with a
ship owner?
The members of government
boards are no doubt usually pretty wise men,
but sometimes they do not know very much
about fthe businesses over which they are
given control. Suppose John Jones and Bill
Smith. one a shipper and the other a ship
owner, want to make a bargain as to rates
to be charged for shipment of goods on the
Atlantic coast. Why should they have to
subiit their bargain for the approval of a

FEBRUARY 3, 1937
commission in Ottawa, a thousand or more
miles away from the scene? I object to
that kind of thing.
I can understand, honourable senators, that
the Government may have some right to regulate rates in the case of ships receiving Government subsidies. For instance, with respect
to steamers plying between Vancouver and
Japan, or between Halifax and South Africa,
or even coastal steamers running between
Yarmouth and Saint John, or between Halifax and Sherbrooke, or Halifax and Cape
Breton, I can see that where a subsidy is being paid the Government may have the right
to say, "We do not want you to charge too
much to the people who are using this service,
and so that we may be sure of what you are
charging you must file with a government
department a schedule of your rates." But,
honourable senators, where a private individual builds or operates ships, or invests
money in ships, why should the Government
or any government commission have power
to say what rates that individual shall charge
for transporting goods? Why should the
ship owner be unable to make an arrangement with a shipper unless he has first got
approval from Ottawa? Suppose the honourable senator from Cardigan (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) has 6,000 bags of potatoes that he
wants to ship from Montague, Prince Edward
Island, to Halifax, and he sends me a telegram offering to pay a rate of 60 cents a
bag. I reply and say I will do it for 65
cents, and after some dickering we agree
upon 62J cents. Well, if this Bill passes,
before we could make a definite bargain we
should have to telegraph to Ottawa to see
if the Board of Transport Commissioners
were satisfied. The thing is ridiculous, honourable senators, and I say that we should
be very careful before we interfere in such
a way with the interests of private individuals in this country.
I have already said that I am not objecting
at the moment to the BiH, because I have not
had an opportunity of studying it. But I
want to urge upon honourable senators my
view that the less interference we have with
private business in this country the better it
will be. We have gone too far already; there
is entirely too much paternalism. You can
hardly move or turn around now without
having to get a licence from a federal or provincial board or a municipal council. The
sooner we put a stop to that sort of thing
the better it wi'll be for us all.
Right 'Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM:
Honourable senators, I am not going to make
a speech, for I am not sure just what I may
have to say until I digest this Bill a little

53

more carefully. I have had some experience
in endeavouring to control shipping rates.
At one time I went to Great Britain in an
attempt to fortify myself with information,
when some people wera thinking, quite
seriously, that we could come to an arrangement with the Motherland for controlling
ocean rates. I forget just now the exact argument of those people, but it was to the effect
that the rates charged with respect to any
ship landing in Canada could be regulated
through a licence system. Well, I found that
point of view was not received sympathetically
by the British Government or ship owners.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I went further.
I ddscussed the matter with some of our
American friends, and I received the impression that perhaps they might get the better
of us on certain matters. So I came away
thinking that unless we could safeguard ourselves in that direction we were not going to
get very far.
During my term of office as Minister of
Railways our Board of Railway Commissioners
were proposing, or perhaps had proposedi to
them, a union of themselves with the Interstate Commerce Commission for the purpose
of dealing with international traffic. A discussion of intereste' parties, particularly of
transportation men and members of the Railway Board, fina'liy took place in my bedroom,
where I was confined. That day I was not
in very good humour, and perhaps I was
seeing things red. Anyway, the result of it
all was that no such arrangement was made.
It is not my intention to tell this 'House why
no arrangement was made, but I may say I
concluded tihat what was proposed would not
be beneficial to Canadian producers or transportation companies.
As my honourable friend fro-m Lunenburg
(Hon. Mr. Duff) says, this is a very important Bill. It goes deeper than we perhaps
think it does, and has ramifications that may
not have been brought to our attention, or
possibly the attention of the department. On
the St. Lawrence, for instance, we have many
small craft, such as motor-boats, and it is
necessary in a particular locality to allow
them to do transport business. I am wondering how this Bill would affect them. Being
chairman of the committee to which the Bill
is to be referred, of course I am non-committal. I want to hear the arguments pro
and con before I corne to a conclusion. It
is a measure of great possibilities for good,
and we must be careful not to make a misstep. I do not suppose the committee wil
summon anybody before it, but no doubt it

54

SENATE

will give all parties interested-railways,
shipping companies, small ship owners, airwav conpanies, and notor-truck companies
-full
opportunity to be heard. I imagine
motor highway traffic would bring in the
provincial governments.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Not necessarily.

Rigit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I am inclined
to think they will want to be heard, and if se,
we must give them time to present their
views before we reach any conclusions. That
is one reasor for suggesting that the committee meet on the rising of the House; not te
do any business concerning the contents of
the Bill, but to arrive at some procedure by
which we may notify those interested when
they can appear before the committee.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
As I have already said, ample opportunity will be given
all interests te be heard before the Railway
Committee. I need only repeat what I said
yesterday, that by giving second reading te
this Bill no honourable senator is committed
to its principle. Either on the report of the
committee or on the motion for third reading
honourable iiembera will have full opportunitv
to express their views and take their stand
on the principle involved.
My right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr.
Meiglen) has expressed a doubt as te the
possibility of doing anything practicable in
the way of controlling the motor-truck business, it being mostly provincial in scope. As
I have already stated, I believe the provinces
are as interested as the Dominion in maintaining certain standards of operation of
heavy motor-trucks and in protecting their
road-bed, and will very likely desire to ceoperate with the Federal Government to
establish some working arrangement.
Our Railway Committee is well equipped
to hear all contending parties. In order te
expedite matters, and, as my right honourable
friend (Right Hon. Mr. Graham) bas said,
prepare the procedure for the sittings of the
committee, I now move second reading of the
Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved that the
Bill be referred to the Standing Committee
on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours.
Hon. Mr. PARENT:
In view of the
importance of this Bill, I should like to know
whether it is the intention to have the
evidence before the committee taken in shorthand.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It will be for
the committee te decide as to that.
The motion was agreed to.

FREE FOREIGN TRADE ZONES BILL

57

WEIGHTS AND MEASURES BILL

SECOND READING

CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN moved the
second reading of Bill A, an Act to enable
the establishment, operation and maintenance
of Free Foreign Trade Zones.
H1e said: Honourable members, I am sure
that you will pardon me if I do not repeat
the rather lengthly remarks that I made
when this Bill came up for second reading
last session. There is absolutely nothing new
that I can say. The Bill is exactly the same
as the Bill of last year. Honourable members
will recall that that Bill was referred to a
special committee which sat for some three
weeks, on and off, got all the information
available, and reported the Bill back to the
Senate. The report was adopted, and the
Bill was passed, but it reached the House of
Commons just the day before prorogation and
there was not sufficient time to give it proper
consideration there. I therefore crave the
indulgence of the Senate in asking to have
the Bill reai a second time now, so that it
can be sent to the other House, to be dealt
with as is deemed fit.
I move the second reading of the Bill,
secondedi by Hon. Mr. Rainville.

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 4, an
Act to amend the Weights and Measures Act.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Before the
motion is carried:, I wish to say on behalf of
the honouraible senator who has been named
as the seconder (Hon. Mr. Rainville) that he
desired the second reading carried over till
Tuesday.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I was going to suggest that he could hardly be accepted as
seconder during his absence.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: He was just
designated in that way.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: In making his
motion my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) said that it was seconded by Senator
Rainville.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: He asked me to
have it seconded in his name. He had to be
away to-day to attend to a very important
financial transaction. He is just as anxioue
as I am to see the Bill go to the other House.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am sure it
is the desire of the honourable senator (Hon.
Mr. Rainville) to speak on the Bill. He can
do that if the third reading goes over until
Tuesday.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

Hon. Mr. Coté in the Chair.
On section 1-recovery of penalties:
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Mr. Chairman, I move the suggested amendment, which
was referred to yesterday. It is as follows:
Strike out all the words following "two"
in the twelfth line to the end of the Bill and
substitute the following: "such justices or
before any person who is authorized by section
604 of the Criminal Code to exercise in such
district, county or place the powers of two
or more justices."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
That is the
suggested amendment which I mentioned yesterday.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The amendment would undoubtedly improve the phraseology of the section. Our Parliamentary
Counsel takes the view that the whole Bill
is unnecessary, but that it does no harm.
The law will be just the same after this
measure is passed.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Mr. Chairman, may
I ask if it is the purpose of the Bill to give
exclusive jurisdiction to a justice of the peace
with respect to the first class of offences
mentioned?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Oh, no.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

No.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It makes clear
that when the penalty exceeds $50 a justice
of the peace, or two justices of the peace,
or a police magistrate, a stipendiary magistrate,
or any person having the power or authority
of two or more justices of the peace, will
have jurisdiction.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: That is true. But the
first part of the section says:
if the penalty does not exceed fifty dollars
by summary conviction before any justice of
the peace for the district, county or place in
which the offence is committed.
That is, as I read the Bill, only a justice
of the peace would have jurisdiction in that
class of cases in which the penalty does not
exceed $50. In the second class of nases,
where the penalty exceeds $50, the section
enumerates different justices or magistrates
who would have jurisdiction. To my mind

58

SENATE

it would have been much better if the section had started in the affirmative, to read
somewhat like this:
if the penalty exceeds fifty dollars by summary conviction before any justice of the peace,
a police magistrate, a stipendiary magistrate,
or any person having the power or authority
of two or more justices of the peace, having
jurisdiction in snoh district, country or placeIn that respect I am suggesting what part
of the section says now. Then I would add:
-and also, besides the above mentioned magistrates, if the penalty does not exceed fifty
dollars, before any justice of the peace for the
district, county or place in which the offence
is conmitted.

As I read the Bill, I cannot see how a
police magistrate or a stipendia-ry magistrate
could have jurisdiction in the class of cases
in which the penalty does not exceed $50.
It seems to me the Bill creates two distinct
classes of offences: those for which the penalty is under $50 and those for which it is
over $50. As to the first class, the Bill says
that a justice of the peace shall have jurisdiction; as to the second class, it states that
any two justices of the peace, a police magistrate, a stipendiary magistrate or any person
having the power or authority of two or more
justices of the peace shall have jurisdiction.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
We are not
affecting the class of cases in which the
penalty does not exceed $50. We are simply
making it clear that if the penalty does exceed $50 it shall be recoverable "by sumimary
conviction before any two justices of the
peace, a police magistrate, a stipendiary magistrate. or any person having the power or
authority of two or more justices of the
peace, having jurisdiction in such district,
county or place ." We are net going beyond
the terms of the present Act.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: How do the justices of the peace know what the penalty will
be until they have heard the case? How are
they to differentiate between a $50 onemagistrate case and a $60 two-magistrate case?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Act clearly
provides that for a certain offence the maximum penalty may be $50 or under; for another offence, $100 or more.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Then the class of
case will be determined by the charge made
against the accused?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: If I understand this
amendment correctly, our police magistrate
in the city of Moncton would have no jurisdiction to try offences if on conviction the
penalty is under $50.
Hon. Mr. LEGER.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. LEGER:
I do not read the
amendmenit in that way.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
magistrate, is he net?

He is a police

Hon. Mr. LEGER: Very truc, but this
amendment says that if the penalty does not
exceed $50 the case must be tried before a
justice of the peace.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Oh, no; it may
be tried before a justice of the peace.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: This is the wording of
the first part of paragraph (b) of section 1
of the Bill:
(b) if the penalty does not exceed fifty
dollars by sunmmnary conviction before any
justice of the peace for the district, county or
place in which the offence is committed.
That is complete in itself.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: A police magistrate is
also a justice of the peace.
Hon. Mr. LEGER:
In my part of the
country a police magistrate is not necessarily
a justice of the peace. The second part of
the paragraph covers the other class of cases,
where the penalty exceeds $50, and it enumerates the different persons who may hear such
cases. It seems to me the purpose of the
amendment would be made clearer by the
simple process of transposing the two parts
of the paragraph and inserting a few words
between them. Paragraph (b) would then
read:
if the penalty exceeds fifty dollars, by summnary conviction before any two justices of the
peace, a police imagistrate, a stipendiary magistrate, or any person having the power or
authority of two or more justices of the peace,
having jurisdiction in such district, county or
placeThen would follow the first half of the paragraph, with a few explanatory words:
-and also, besides the above mentioned, if the
penalty does not exceed fifty dollars, by summary conviction before any justice of the peace
for the district, county or place in which the
offence is committed.
This would obviate any possibility of confusion in dealing with the two classes of cases.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Here is my
appreciation of the position.
Honourable
members will observe that paragraph (b) in
the original Act stops at the word "peace."
If the penalty imposable does net exceed $50,
thcn it can be imposed "by summary conviction before any justice of the peace for the
district, county or place in which the offence
is committed," and, if the penalty imposable
exceeds $50, "by summary conviction before

59

FEBRUARY 4, 1937
any two justices of the peace." The department desires to have it appear in the Act,
as well as in the Criminal Code-in which it
is provided, as I.shall show in a minute-that
where the penalty exceeds $50 the trial may
take place not only before two justices of the
peace, but also before a police magistrate, a
stipendiary magistrate, or any person having
the power or -authority of two justices of the
peace. The departmental officials believe this
amendment will make it lear to any magistrate that he cai try the case if ithe penalty
imposable is more than $50. Amendment is
necessary because in describing those who are
equal in law to two justices of the peace the
wording in, the original section does not follow
the. phrasing of section 604 of the Code. Therefore the Code is cited in the amendment
now moved by the right honourable senator
from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham):
such justices or before any person who is
authorized by section 604 of the Criminal Code
to exercise in such district, county or place
the powers of two or more justices.
With the Act as amended before him, any
magistrate will know he has authority to deal
with a case although the fine imposable is
above $50.
I do not agree with the objection of the
honourable senator from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr.
Leger), for this reason. We do not seek to
create any offence by this Bill. The clause
simply describes before whom cases can be
tried. Where the penalty may be $50 or
under, the case is tried before a justice of
the peace; if over $50, before two justices of
the peace or before any person who takes
their place, as described in the Code. The
point of the honourable senator from L'Acadie
(Hon. Mr. Leger) is that it would not do to
make it impossible for a magistrate to try
the case if the penalty were under $50. Certainly it would not. A magistrate may or
may not be a justice of the peace, but under
the Code he always has the power of a justice of the peace. Consequently, every case
can come before a magistrate. But if the
amount of the penalty exceeds $50 the case
cannot come befom a justice of the peace.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Would this come under
the CodeRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Code
specifies-I cannot cite the section-that
what a justice of the peace can do a magistrate can do.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: That is in criminal cases.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In any cases.
I am not speaking by the book-it is not
before me-but I fancy that my honourable

appointed with all the powers of a justice
of the peace, and that the local Act vests him
with such power.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The law says
one justice of the peace may hear the case
if the penalty does not exceed $50, but if
it exceeds that amount the power of two
justices will be required.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE CONCURRED IN

Hon. Mr. GILLIS moved concurrence in the
second report of the Standing Committee on
Debates and Reporting.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I wonder if the
honourable senator could briefly give us an
indication of the terms and conditions set
forth in the report of the Committee on
Debates and Reporting of June 3, 1913. I
do not know what they are.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: An extract from the
Journals of that date, when the first reporter
was ,appointed, gives an outline of his duties.
That has been followed ever since. The only
change made since is in the amount paid to
Mr. Fortier, the French reporter. I have an
extract from the Journals, but I shall not
read it. The same course has been followed
year after year.
The motion was agreed to.

SENATE

FREE FOREIGN

TRADE

ZONES

BILL

THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN moved the third
reading of Bill A, an Act to enable the establishment, operation and maintenance of free
foreign trade zones.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time.
PASSAGE

OF BILL POSTPONED-MOTION
THIRD READING RESCINDED

FOR

The Hon. the ACTING SPEAKER (Hon.
P. E. Blondin): A Bill, honourable senators.
originating in the Senate, intituled "An Act
to enable the establishment, operation and
maintenance of free foreign trade zones," has
been read the third time and is now ready
to

pasc.

Is

it

your

pleasure,

honourable

senators, to pass this Bill?
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGIIEN: Honourable members, the Senate is quietly and,
so far as I know. without any real consideration, passing this Bill through the House. A
measure as important as this one certainly
imposes upon the Govornnent the duty of
stating its position before one of the branches
of Parliament. I do not know whether we
are all expecting the Bill to be rejected in the
other House, or whebther we want it to be so
treated. The Government so far has net even
asked that the Bill go to a committee. I do
not think the Senate is doing itself justice in
permitting a measure like this to pass four
stages without the represtetative of the Administration bore making so niuch as a comment upon it.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK:
Honourable
senators, personallv J feel under obligation to
the right honourable leader on the other side
for making that statement, because to my
mind it is abnost disgraceful the way this important measure has gone through the first,
second and now the third stageRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Four stages.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:

Three

or

four

stages.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Not yet.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: It is true that last
vear the Bill was before a special committee,
of xhich I happened to be a member. But I
declare here and now that although I undertook to attend all the meetings of that conmittee I never dreamed that a report had
been prepared and was to come before the
House. Now. there is a great deal that I
do not know in connection with this measure.
Possibly I am the only one in this House
Hon. Mr. SMITH.

who is not fully informed on it. It does
seen to me that an important measure of this
kind, involving the collection or the failure
to make collection of certain revenues by
the Government of Canada, should be given
proper consideration by one of the leading
committees of the Senate. I do net want
to make myself particularly objectionable, but
I am going to move a motion that I have
lying before me here, which I have not
asked anybody to second. I move in amendment that all the words in the motionthat is the motion that the Bill be now
read a third time-after the word "now," be
omitted and the following substituted therefor: "referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce."
I am one member of this Chamber who
would like to hear this Bill thrashed out
clause b' clause in one of the responsible
committees of the Senate.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Has the
honourable member chosen the appropriate
committee?
If he has, I feel disposed to
agree with him. I am wondering if the Bill
would cone more appropriately before the
Railway Committee. but this session that
committee will be loaded with perhaps the
most inportant measure we shall have.
lon. Mr. MURDOCK:
That is why I
suggested the Committee on Banking and
Commerce. The Railhvay Committee already
has enough work ahead to keep it busy for
the next three or four weeks, I am sure.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think it
clearl'
should go before one committee or
the otber. I am disposed to agree with
the honourable member, but I should like
a statement from the honourable leader of
the House as to where the Government stands,
if it stands at all.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: I nay state,
honourable senators, that I asked the Hon.
Minister of Transport, and I think also the
Hon. Minister of Customs. who would be
vitally interested in this legislationRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is no
Minister of Customs.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I mean the Minister of National Revenue. I am quite sure
as to the Minister of Transport. I asked
him if he had formed an opinion as to the
merits of this Bill. I found that ho had yet
to be convinced as to the advantages which
would accrue to the country from the enactment of this measure. He was inclined to be
critical, but wa.s readY to study the Bill.
My right honourable friend has asked why
the representative of the Government in this

FEBRUARY 9,1937
Chamber did not express an opinion on the
Bill before it reached the fourth stage, for
the question from the Chair is: Shall this
Bill pass? To this question the Senate can
answer yes or no. I may remind honourable
members that upwards of thirty years ago
a Bill at this stage was rejected on the motion
of Hon. Mr. Miller. The reason why I did
not rise to express my view on this Bill is
that last session a Senate committee studied
a similar Bill, it was then reported to the
House and the report discussed, and we decided to transmit the Bill to the Commons
without, I think, pronouncing any decided
views on the principle involved.
I think there is merit in the proposal to
establish free foreign trade zones. I am informed that New York City is about to
establish a free trade zone at a point not
far distant from the present port. I know
there is such a zone in operation in Genoa,
having motored straight into it without knowing I should be detained until I had disclosed.
all my personal baggage. It will be recalled
that last session we were informed that free
foreign trade zones were in operation at
Hamburg and other important points in
Europe.
Last session the Senate in its wisdom decided that the Commons should have an
opportunity to express an opinion upon the
Bill. This, as I have already said, is a Bill
similar to the one which engaged our attention last year. The Bill was sent to the
House of Commons towards the end of the
session. It was not a Government Bill, but a
public Bill sponsored by a private member
of that House. My right honourable friend,
as a former member of the other House,
knows what little chance there is of such a
Bill passing at that late stage, when Government business is given precedence.
There is nothing unseemly in the procedure
we are following, and I am surprised that my
honourable friend from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) should say that he is somewhat
scandalized. The similar Bill before the Commons last session was not discussed; in fact
I do not think it reached second reading.
Now if we pass this Bill the Commons will
have another opportunity to express their
opinion on it. They may receive it with
favour. It is a permissive Bill; nothing can
be done without the sanction of the Government. The whole question being, it seemed to
me. somewhat academic, I ,did not examine
into the merits or virtues of free trade zones.
I confess that I have not had sufficient data
to enable me to give a decided opinion on
the matter. The free foreign trade zone in
operation in Hamburg has apparently given
very satisfactory results. It may be, of course,

63

that our conditions would not justify a similar
venture in this Dominion. However, I have
no opinion to express on the question, and
I have no objection to the Bill being sent
over to the House of Commons to be dealt
with there.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I agree with my right honourable
leader (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) that this
is a question of far-reaching importance. It
is not by any means new. Some thirty years
ago, vhen I was a harbour commissioner for
the port of Montreal, the question was a live
one.
I should like to suggest to the honourable
leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) that instead of this Bill being referred
to the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce it be referred to the Committee on
Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours. The
membership of those two important committees is pretty much the same. I should also
like to sec the special report-which, I regret
to state, I have not yet had an opportunity
to study-submitted to the Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and, Harbours.
I am satisfied that the Bill is of such importance that the Shipping Federation of
Montreal, the Montreal Board of Trade, the
Chambre de Commerce and the railways
should be asked if they have any representations to make, as I am quite sure they will
desire to be heard. Unless opinion in Montreal has changed in recent years, I do not
think any of these interests are very favourably disposed towards the proposal. I am
strongly of opinion that the Bill should be
given the serious consideration that the importance of the problem warrants.
Honourable
Hon. J. J. RAINVILLE:
senators, I would point out that the question
before us is whether the Bill shall pass. There
is no question of referring it back to a committee.
Last session, it will be recalled, we discussed
thoroughly this question of free foreign trade
zones, and I made a speech in support of the
Bill. I do not intend to repeat now the arguments which I then advanced in its favour.
The Bill was referred to the Railway Committee and' we heard representations from
the Board of Trade of Montreal, the Chambre
de Commerce, the Shipping Federation and
other interests. I remember the honourable
senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock)
complimented me on what he termed the
wonderful testimony given by Major George
Washington Stephens, at one time head of the
port of Montreal and an acknowledged expert
on port management. My honourable friend
said it was a revelation to him.

FEBRUARY 9, 1937
Righit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:. I cannot
recail any debate at ail upon the report of
the committee. I think the honourable senator
fromn Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) will
confirrn my statement th-at when the -report
was before this House for consideration there
was no debate upon the measure.
Hon. Mr. KING: If
me, we had a debate.

my memory serves

Righit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What I say
is that although we are at the fourth stage
of this B]ll we can take any step we wish.
The Bill cannot pass without our approval.
I do not think I arn far from the mark when
I say that I think we can make an amendment to refer. and surely we should do that.
Let us in this assembly thoroughly review,
canvass and debate the report of the comnmittee; then, if we decide to support it, well
and good. I have no straight and definite
opinion upon the Bill, but I should flot like
to see it go through this House in such a
way that we can be said to have approved of
it when we really have not considered it at ail.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I have a seconder
now. 1 understand the motion before the
Senate to beHon. Mr.

DANDURAND:

There

is no

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I understand the
motion to be that Bill A be read a third time.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No, no. That has
been done.
The Hon. the ACTING SPEAKER: I put
the question: "Shahl this Bill be read a third
time?" and as no one rose. I said. "Carried."
After that I put the question: " Bill A,
intituled 'An Act to enable the establishment,
operation and maintenance of Free Foreign
Trade Zones' bas been read a third time
and is now ready to pass. Is it your pleasure,
honourable members,
that this Bill be
passed?" Then the discussion started.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
May I give
some explanation as to procedure? I arn not
quite sure that the suggestion I arn about
to make is absolutely in accordance with our
rules, but the Senate can do many things by
unanimous consent. We may, at the request
of the mover and the seconder, retrace our
steps and abandon the passage of the third
reading. The Bill would then be at the saine
stage as when we cornrenced this evening. I
think the Senate would have no partieular
objection to that proce-dure, and I would urge
the sponsors of the Bill to accept this suggestion. If they do not feel like accepting it,

6

then we fali under clause 25a of the Rules of
the Senate. which reads as follows:
No.-question or amiendsnent shall be proposed
which is the same in substance as any question
or ainenduient which, during the sarne session,
bas been resolved in the alrmative, or negative, un1ess the order, reso1 ution or vote on
such question or aniendmnent bas been reacinded.
A motion eau be made to rescind the third
reading, but then the matter will have to
stand for five days before it is taken up by
the Senate. Clause 25b reads:
An order, resolution or other vote of the
Senate rnay be rescinded; but no such order,
resolution or other vote inay be rescinded
unless five days' notice be given and at least
two-thirds of the senators present vote in
favour of its resciasion; provided that, to correct irregularities or miistakes, one day's notice
only shall be sufficient.
A motion may now be made to rescind the
third reading, or notice may be given of a
motion to rescind, which would be taken up
in five days. I think that is the only motion
that can regularly be made.
Yet, the Senate, if it will unanimously agree,
has full authority to retrace its steps and to
take as not passed the motion for the third
reading.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I do not want to
prolong this discussion. I arn entirely in the
hands of the House.
The right honourable gentleman who leads
the other side of the House (Riglit Hon. Mr.
Meighen) said *he did not recolleet the facts.

I have a very clear recollection.

This Bill

dragged before this House for more than two
months, and the committee sat for three
weeks or more. The Bill is only permissive.

The Govemnment may neyer act upon it.

I

do not know that any other bill I have ever
fieen connected with was talked about as
much as this one, or took as mucli time in
going through this House. I arn surprised
at the right honourable gentleman. 1 think
that hie, seeing that there was only one order
on the Order Paper, wanted to start a good
discussion so that the Senate wuuld be busy
for a little while. I think also that he was
unfair in asking the opinion of the Government. because there is only one representative
of the Government here, and lie is not the
Governrnent.
He could flot speak for the
Government.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: ýOh, yes.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Well then, I take
that baek. If lie can speak for the Government, what have the other fourteen or fifteen
members of it to say?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

SENATE

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The committee had
its meetings, which were lengthy, and the
Government was represented at those meetings. It sent no fewer than three departmental
officials to attend the committee. The honourable senator from Montarville (Hon. Mr.
Beaubieo), cross-questioning them, asked:
"Is that the only thing you have against this
Bill? Is that your last word?" The reply
was. "Yes." Some of the members of the
committee were most enthusiastic about the
Bill. To-day, for some reason or other--I
do not know what-they do not seem to be
so much in favour of it.
Why not give the House of Commons a
chance? We know this session is going to be
short; at least, that is the intention. It all
depends on the Opposition. Why not allow
this Bill to go to the House of Commons like
other bills, and let that House deal with it as
it sees fit? I really believe this is a Bill that
interests the House of Commons just as mnuch
as, or more than. it interests this House. I
should like to see it go to the House of Comnons, but I am in the hands of honourable
members.
If von vant to go over the whole matter
again. we will; but if anybody wants to kill
the Bill, why not kill it now instead of delaying its arrival in the House of Commons
until there is not time for consideration? I
understand the Government has taken away
the private members' days in that House,
and it may be weeks before the Bill can be

the other House just two days before prorogation, and the gentlemen w-ho were going
to propose and second it were down in Quebec, where there was a political crisis at the
time.
Then I met Mr. H. H. Stevens, just by
chance. He said, "That is an excellent Bill
of yours." He did what he could for it. Mr.
Ilsley, the Minister of National Revenue,
said, "I have no objection to the Bill, but I
have not had a chance to read it." So the
Bill was delayed.
I have never asked favours of this House
before, but I would now ask, as a great favour,
that it let this Bill go to the House of Commons.
Would the
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
honourable gentleman allow one question? He
is familiar with this whole matter, and can
answer. Did the Shipping Federation, the
Boards of Trade and the railway companies
approve of this Bill?
Hon. Mr. CASCRAIN: I do not think they
did.
Furthermore, in Montreal we have
many wholesale warehouses where goods are
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

placed in bond. and the gentlemen operating
these, being ill-informed, I think, believed it
might diminish 'their revenue. They are generally actuated by their own private interests.
On the other hand, absolutely independent
men like Major George Washington Stephens
were in favour of it. He actually worked for
two years in Hamburg when the population
was only about 200,000, he went over for the
purpose of studying German), and later, when
he was harbour commissioner, he went back
again and found the population had increased to 2,000.000. And it is still increasing.
Last Monday a free trade zone was opened in
New York. It is the first one in the United
States, but in France ýthere are two, and in
Germany three or four. Free ports have
existed from the time of the Hanseatie
League.
The Bill cannot do any harm to anybody.
That is one thing sure. Even if it does not
cure our ills, it can do no harm. So I beg of
the right honourable the leader of the Opposition to let it go through. He knows I have
been a good supporter of his on many occasions.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators, may I sav that the interests my honourable friend from Alma (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne)
bas referred to were not represented before
the special committee last year, and so far as
I know were not asked to appear. Furthermore, since that time a National Harbours
Board has been appointed, which may have
sorme views on this particular question. Therefore I move, seconded, as I understand, by
the honourable senator from Alma (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne), that Rule 25b be suspended, and
that the motion passed for the third reading
of the Bill be rescinded.
The motion was agreed to.
MOTION

FOR REFERENCE TO COMMITTEEDEBATE ADJOURNED

The Hon. the ACTING SPEAKER: The
question, ionourable members, is on the third
rcading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I would move,
seconded by the honourable senator from
Alma (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne), that this Bill
be referred to the Committee on Railways,
Telegraphs and Harbours.
The Hon. the ACTING SPEAKER: Is it
your pleasure to adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: Honourable senators, if this motion is made for the purpose of
calling witnesses again, I may say that when

FEBRUARY 9, 1937
the. committee sat last year all those whose
names were submitted to us were called upon
and gave their views on the matter. Now that
the third reading has been rescinded, I believe
that both the honourable leader of the Government and the right honourable leader of the
Opposition would be in favour of a day being
set aside to discuss the report.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: It would take at
least three weeks to repeat the inquiry that
was made in the committee last year. We did
the best we could, and I do not think we
did badly. I for one am looking for an
opportunity to discuss this report.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
Does not the
honourable gentleman think the newly created
Harbours Board should be asked for its views?
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: Not at all.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: No?
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: No, not at all.
We have made a terrible mistake in centralizing the harbour commissions of Canada,
and we shall realize it before long. This question of free ports is absolutely independent
of any centralization of ports. It is an altogether different business. The free port
will not be in the hands of this central
body, but in the hands of private individuals
who will be licensed by the Government and
will bear the expense. I do not see that any
good purpose can be served by sending the
Bill to a committee, but I should welcome a
discussion of the report which was made last
year. I would move, therefore, in amendment
to the motion of the honourable senator from
Parkdale, that a day be fixed for a discussion
of the report made last year.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I do not know
whether I have made myself clear or not.
I was a member of the committee last year.
Rightly or wrongly, I thought then, and I
think now, that only those who were generally
favourable to the proposal were brought
before the committee, and that we did not
have an opportunity of getting the other
point of view.
Hon.
senator
of the
opposed

Mr. RAINVILLE: The honourable
knows very well that two or three
witnesses pronounced themselves as
to free ports.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: But the preponderance of evidence given before the special
committee last year was in favour of free
ports. Possibly free ports are desirable, but
I think we ought to know more about them
than we do at the present time. I believe
31117-5j

the only way to get further information is
to send the Bill to the Standing Committee
on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours, where
we can have a real free-for-all, and where,
with all due respect to my honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Rainville), we can get the viewpoint of the newly created National Harbours
Board.
Hon. THOMAS CANTLEY: Honourable
members, this matter was fairly well discussed
a year ago, at which time I expressed myself
very freely and at some length in regard to
it. To talk about a free port in Montreal
is, to my mind, absolute nonsense. You cannot make a free port in a place that is frozen
up four or five months in the year. I know
of only two points in Canada where there is
any possibility of a free port being successful,
namely, Halifax and Vancouver. Who is
going to spend $50,000, $60,0000 or $100,000
to equip a free port?
We talk about Hanburg. I have been in
Hamburg and in two or three of the other
free ports in Europe; so I should perhape
know something about them. In those cases
there are special reasons and incidents to explain why such ports are more or less
successful. Hamburg is the only one that is
a conspicuous success, and it is that because
it serves a large ,territory contiguous to that
port and without access to the sea.
At one time it was thought that a large
amount of manufacturing would be centered
in a free port; that is, that raw materials
would be brought there amnd reconstructed into
other forms of merchandise and then shipped
out, without any duty having been paid. But
in this respect free ports have been a great
disappointment. Then it was thought that
considerable shipbuilding would be undertaken
at free ports. This to some extent has proven
a well founded expectation, for more small
shipbuilding than any other form of manufacturing has been done at these places.
Taking all the facts into consideration, in
the limited way in which I am familiar with
them, I do not see any possibility of any
practical good coming from this Bill. As I
have already pointed out, a free port must
be built at a point to which shipping can find
access at ail seasons of the year. That rules
out the whole St. Lawrence.
Hon. B. F. SMITH: What about Saint
John?
Hon. Mr. CANTLEY: Saint John is all
right; ahmost as good as Halifax-not quite.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: It never freezes over,

68

SENATE

Hon. Mr. CANTLEY: Honourable members
can pass the Bill if they wish, but it will
never have any practical results, in my
judgment.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I know that on the question of the
best way to handle this measure there is a
difference of view as between the honourable
senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock),
for whose attitude I have a great deal of
sympathy, and the honourable senator who
seconds the main motion (Hon. Mr. Rainville). Would it not meet the views of the
honourable senator from Parkdale if we
adjourned the debate and fixed a day, say this
week, when with the report of last year's
special committee before us we can thoroughly
review this measure? That is mainly what
I have had in mind. I do not like to insist
upon further submission to a committee, for
two reasons. In the first place, it would seem
a reflection upon the committee that has
already considered the measure. I have no
ground for reflecting upon that committee.
I have not the least cause to think that it
did, not impartially hear evidence, pro and
con, and honestly and faithfully do all its
work. If that is the case, and if we are to
have time to make a thorough study of that
committee's report, we are hardly justified in
insisting that the Bill be sent to another
committee.
My second reason-and this has been
pressed by the sponsor of the Bill-is that
although this is a public Bill it is introduced by a private member here and, will be
introduced in the other House by a private
member, and unless it is passed here early in
the session it will fall by the wayside without
being considered in that other House at all.
That is a very important consideration.
Could we not fix a date agreeable to ah
honourable senaýtors-say Thursday next-for
continuing the debate? In the meantime we
could make a thorough study of the report
presented by last year's committee. I have
been trying in vain to get a copy of the Senate
Debates of 1936, in order to confirm my recollection that the report of that committee never
was under review by this Chamber. I do not
think we ever passed upon the measure in the
]ight of the committee's report. To find that
I am wrong would have some effect upon my
judgment. I cannot remember what the committee reported, what its definite recommendatien was, and I am sure that if there ha.d been
a debate upon the report when I was here I
should have a clear recolleetion of the purport of the committee's recommendation. My
suggestion is that I be allowed to move the
Hon. Mr. SMITH.

adjournment of the debate, on the understanding, if the leader of the Government is agireeable, that it be resumed on Thursday. In the
meantime honourable members will have an
ample opportunity to study the committee's
report, and the BiHl in relation to tha.t.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I have no objection to that procedure. But I should like to
make sure that the report contained the evidence taken in shorthand before the committee
and that it can be obtained and distributed to
honourable members.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE:
tributed already.

It has all been dis-

Right Hon. M.r. MEIGHEN: It should be
pointed out, honourable members, that we
should not give this measure slight consideratino simply because it is a permissive measure.
It ought to receive the consideration that we
give to any other measure of tremendouis consequences which contemplates a departure in
public policy. The bills authorizing the construction of the Grand Trunk Pacifie and of
the Transcontinental were permissive measures,
as was the bill authorizing the construction of
the Canadian Pacifie Radiway. In those instances the Government did not say it was
indifferent as to whether the measures passed,
simply because they were permissive.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Honourable senators, I
should like te know if evidence taken before
the committee was published in the report.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
in full.

Yes, it was printed

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I am informed
by the Clerk of the House that 500 copies were
printed and that there are available enough
for distribution to honourable senators.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:

My view, which

may be right or may be wrong andilnot worth
anything, is that, generally speaking, only one
side of the argument was before the committee.
If there is any ground for that view, are we not
justified in undertaking to have the other side
of the argument presented by responsible harbour men? That is the only point I have in
mind.
On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen, the
debate was adjourned until Thursday next.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, the first paragraph of the inquiry

from Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Sauvé) was twofald,
and it was represented ta me that the answec

SENATE

The Hon. the SPEAKER: The honourable
memuber from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock)
is quite correct. There is a motion before
the House, moved in amoendment by the
honourable iember froin Parkdale; and the
debale was adjourned by the right honourable
senator fron St. Mary's (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen).

However, I do not purpose discussing the
measure. What I desired was that I shouH
have an opportunity, and that the Senate
should have an opportunity, of reviewing
fully the report made by the special committee
last session on a Bill which was the same as
the one we have now before us. It will be
recalled that Tuesday evening I gave te the
House my recollection that there had been no
discussion of the mîeasture in the light of that
report, and that the committee's report had
never been before us. I spoke subject ta
correction, but I find I was right. The connittee made its report, quite true, but it was
made rather late in the session and was never
at any time debated in this House. When later
the order for third reading of the mreasure
came up, I with other members of the House
agreed that the third reading might proceed.
The circumstances wore that fthe report was
brought down so late in the session that if the
Bill was te be considered at all by the other
House we could no longer defer decision iere.
But now we are at a comparatively early stage
of the session. I felt then, and still feel, that
it is well we should decide our course after as
thorough a review as possible of the evidence
then taken and of the report of the committee.
I have read -the evidence of three witnesses.
including Mr. Stephens', but have been rather
dlisappointed in its material features. It seens
to me the witnesses made no attempt to think
in terms of the circumstances of Canada as
distinguished from those of Gernany and other
countries where free ports undoubtedly have
succeeded.
The evidence is not convincing
either for or against the moasure. For my
part, I should welcone sene further discussion by the sponsors of the Bill and by other
who since last session have given some thought
to the subject and who. I know, have very
carefully studied the report. After we have
heard their views and their criticism of the
evidence and report, we shall be able te decide
more intelligently our course of action.

Riglt Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, my interpretation of what
took place was different, namely, that a motion
had passed to rescind the third reading, leaving the motion for third rcading to be made
again by the sponsor of the Bill. Before
that third reading was rescinded I had suggested an adjournment of the debate. but at
that tinme the debate was on the fourth stage,
the queiron whether the Bill should pass.
After the carrying of the honourable senator
from Parkdale's motion to rescind the previous
third reading. I did not rise to move adjournment of debate on the question of third
reading.

Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, I may run the risk of being considered
a poor sport for raising now sone questions
that I think should be raised. It will be
observed that the report of last yeaýr's hearings
before us relative to free ports indicates that
the committee adjourned on June 6 until
June 9. As a matter of fact the committee
adjourned on June 6. There is nothing to
show that the members ever met again. However, they did meet, but no stenographic
record was made of the proceedings. I was
there as a member of the committee. and much
to my surprise found that a report was ready
for submission to the Senate. As we know,

to it was not conmplete.

I an now informed

that the word "Yes" answers the two questions contained in that paragraph.

FEBRUARY 11, 1937
the House adopted the report because, as was
alleged, and correctly so, we were then close
to the end of the session.
I was very much enthused with the evidence
given by Mr. Stephens. I thought it sounded
good. but I felt we were entitled to hear the
other side of the case, especially as one off
the witnesses (as will be seen on page 21 off
the evidence) stated that telegraphic communications had been received from Vancouver,
Windsor, Toronto, Hamilton, Quebec, Montreal, Saint John and Halifax disapproving off
the proposed legislation. I assumed that we
should get the views of responsible members
representing the boards of trade in those
large cities, and therefore I was much surprised to findî the matter rushed, through and
a report presented to the Senate.
This session we are confronted with exactly
the same Bill as that which we had last
session, and with no discussion at all, we gave
first, second and third reading. There is much
with respect to free foreign trade zones that
I know nothing about, and I feel that under
the circumstances I am entitled to know why
the boards of trade to which I have referred
are against this measure. I am entitled also, I
think, to know the viewpoint of the National
Board which has been funeHarbours
tioning since we dealt with the Bill last session. That is why on Tuesday last I moved,
secondied by the honourable senator from
Alma (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne), that all the
words in the motion after the word "now"
be omitted and the following substituted
therefor: "referred to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce." As a result of
some discussion on that occasion, I agreed
whole-heartedly that possibly the measure
should be referred, to the Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours. But surely
some committee should1 hear any objections
which may be raised against Mr. Stephens'
recommendiations-recommendations
earnest
made. I think, as the result of pretty complete
knowledge and careful study. I think the
Senate would be making a mistake if it were
to send to the other House an important Bill
of this kind, dealing with something entirely
new, without a reasonable investigation off
both sides of the question, and I arn one who
respectfully contends that, speaking generally,
only one side of the question was dealt with
last year before the special committee of the
Senate.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators,
I do not wish to prolong the discussion on
this matter. The other night when the right
honourable the leader opposite (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) indicatedt that there had been
no discussion of this matterRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Of the report.

Hon. Mr. KING: Yes, of the report-I
was under the impression that there had been.
Upon reviewing the situation I find that he
was correct. The report was adopted and the
Bill was read the third, time without much
discussion. But there was a very serious and
lengthy discussion previous to the appointment of the committee.
The eommittee held a number of sittings
and afforded an opportunity to those interested
in the idea to appear. Among those who
appeared before the committee was Major
Stephens, a gentleman who is regarded as a
port authority. As a young man he lived in
Hamburg in 1888, at which time he made
observations. Some twenty years later, when
he had become president of the port of Montreal, he returned to Hamburg and, again
investigated and saw for himself the development of that port, and adivantages, as he
believed, that it afforded to the people it
served. His statement was very convincing.
I, like the honourable senator from Parkdale
(Hon. Mr. Murdock), have very little knowledge of free ports, but I think we were all
impressed by Major Stephens. Then the
Shipping Federation appeared before us in
the person of Mr.Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

MacCallum.

Hon. Mr. KING: Yes. If one reads Mr.
MacCallum's evidence-there is very little of
it--one will find that he indicated that under
our present customs regulations, through our
bonding privileges, we had met the situation
very well. He said that the people he represented did not see any great necessity for
free ports in Canada. In addition there was
Mr. Clarke, secretary of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, representing the varions
His
boards of trade throughout Canada.
evidence would indicate that they as a body
were fairly well satisfied with the customs
situation generally in Canada and were not
disposed to favour free ports.
During the investigation it was brought
out that the question of free ports had been
under consideration for many years in the
Representations
United States of America.
were made to Congress from time to time,
but each and every time the matter was
carried before Congress it was contended by
those engaged in manufacturing in the United
States that their interests would be seriously
affected by free ports. It was also shewn
before the committee that last year, owing
to conditions which had arisen in the port
of New York, the Government had decided
to pass a bill permitting free ports, and that
a free port had been established in that
harbour.

SENATE
J am in accord with the motion that this
matter receive further consideration. and I
think it might well be referred to a standing
committee of this House. In view of the work
before the Railwav Committee, I would suggest, if it is agreeable to the honourable
senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock),
that this Bill be referred to the Committee
on Banking and Commerce, where we can
asocertain more about the development in the
port of New York.
This question cannot easily be pushed aside.
We know that in Germany, in Holland and
various other countries of Europe there have
been free ports. Some have succeeded, some
have not. Apparently there is an advantage
to be gained by the establishment of free
ports in a country where goods can be reassembled and transhipped. I think this subject
is worthy of investigation, and am quite in
accord with the suggestion that the matter
be referred to a special committee, or to a
general committee of this House, for further
consideration.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I am quite willing
to leave to the House the selection of the
committee to which the Bill should be referred.
The Banking and Commerce Committee will
satisfy me. It can get the information.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Murdock was
agreed to. and the Bill was referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.

GOVERNMENT HARBOURS AND PIERS

BILL
SECOND

READING

Heu. RAOUL DANDURAND

moved the

second reading of Bill 9, an Act te amcnd
the Geverument Harbours sud Piers Act.
H1e said: Heneurable senators, the objeet of
this Bill is te amend the Gevernment Harheurs and Piers Act, which regulates the administration of ail the barbours that are net under
a commission and which cevers some 950 small
wharves threugbeut the Dominion, most of
them built by the Department of Public
Works, but afterwards trausferred te the Department of Transport. These works are generally operated and managed by a wbarfinger,
who attends te the reception of geods at the
wharf, sees te the lighting when lighting is
required, and se on.
In many smaîl places there is censiderable
difficulty in ebtaining perseus te act as
wharflngers. They are paid by fees levîed
for the haudliug of the goods, and under
the Audit Act are supposed te hand over te
the Treasury the amounts tbey colleet. But
that is net wbat has been donc in practice.

73

Sinee 1930 er 1931 the wharflugers bave been
allewed te retain the ameunt of expenses
iucurred. in the management of the wharf,
as welI as their fees. As this is in violation
of the statute, the purpose of this Bill is
te regularize what is new the practice.
It will be seen that the Minister assumes
the obligation of selecting the wharfiugers and
other assistants when there is need for tbem.
The Governer in Council used te make the
appointments, but in 1918, 1 helieve, this duty
was trausferred te the Civil Service Comnmission. In 1922 the Civil Service Commission, finding that it ceuld net even obtain
replies from men who were asked te serve
as wharfingers, recommended that the Minister
should have autherity te make the appointments. Se there is an ameudmeut which bas
for its object the vesting of this, autherity
in the Minister. As the Minister bas said
in another place, it is very seldem that hie
attends te these matters bimself, because there
ia in the departmnent an officer wbo rmains
about trying te find men of goed will te
accept the positions.
When a man dees accept the position bie
bas duties te perform, but dees net get well
paid. As I have said, the remuneratien comnes
from fees. The complaint bas been made
that at a certain place there is a wharf with
a wharfinger, whe collects bis fee, wbile at a
distance of a few miles there is a wbarf witheut a wharfinger, and eonsequently ne fees
have te be paid. That is a situation which
aIl governments bave faced and canet well
cure. Tbere is ne wharfiuger wbeu ne one
can be found wbo is willing te serve. It
may he asked why the Goverument dees
net pay salaries te peeple appoiuted te do
tbis work. Well, if tbat were doue tbe ameuut
of tbe salaries would be much larger tban
the total receipts collected fremn tbose smaîl
wbarves.
Iu many places tbe wharfiuger dees important work, for hoe receives geods and is
responsible for them. H1e may bave te store
goods, by eue meaus or another, until the
owner calîs fer tbem. Wheu the owuer requires possession, the wharflnger, wbe may
live baîf a mile or farther frem the wbarf,
bas te cerne and baud ever tbe goods, and
bis fee for the whole job will be perhaps
five or ten cents. Se a man needs seme public
spirit in order te undertake work of that kiud.
The ameudments are of ne special importance. I have eutliued tbe main eues.
When we go jute Committee of tbe Whele
I shaîl auswer auy questions as te the werkiug
of the present law and as te details of tbe
Bill.

With the greatest deference to

becaut-e the Civil Service Commission could

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Other chauscs

As I see il. lthe Bill

tippoint monts. Arn I wrong?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Yes. Until 1918
the Governor in Couincil appointed ail these
xvharfingers. In 1918 the Civ il Service Commissiont were attorized 10 make appoitntments ani they continued, to make thena
until 1922, when they fotînd it impossible lia

get appiicants, whereupon they asked the
Minister to make appointments. Since 1922
the Minister bas done so.
Hon. Mr. MeMEAN--S: So this Bill takes
away certain authority from the Civil Service
Commission and, in effeet, confers upon the
Minister power 10 exercise a certain amount
of politicai patronage. 1 do not understanci
the Horbours and Piers Act, but I galber
(bat in future appointments will be made by
the Minister instead of the Civil Service
Commission. That conveys te my mind just
one thing: tbat the Government will make
politicai appoinîments; to hose jobs.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN:

FEBRUARY 15, 19-37
honourable leader of the Government that
the change is being made for the purpose
I have suggested. And I do not like that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURA1ND: It was just
because I thought there was some such idea
in my honourable friend's mind that I gave
the explanation.
Hon. Mr. Mc.MEANS:
The hon ourable
gentleman did not make his explanation very
clear.
Hon, C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I think that the new section ivili
give the Minister more latitude than the
section which is being repealed. The present
section 6, which is to be repealed, reads as
follows:
The Goernor ini Couneil miay appoint or
direct sucli officers; or persons as hie thinks
proper. who shall have, under the direction of
the Minister, the charge of the works hy this
Act placed under the management and control
of the Minister, and who shail colleet the tolîs
and dues to be paid in respect thereof.
But the substituted~ section gives the Minister
power to appoint "officers. clerks, employees
or labourers" to perform duties in connection
with the management and control of wharves
and to collect tolis and dues, and to charge
certain expenses against such toîls and dues.
This is certainly very obscure, and 1 agree
with my honourahle friend from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. McMeans) that we ought to have
more information. The amendment dicals
not only with appointment of wharfingers;
as the House will note, the Minister is given
authority to "appoint such officers, clerks,
employees or labourers as hie may think
proper." No one knows how many might be
appointed in certain pressing times, as on the
eve of a general election, for instance. That
is a risk we have to take.
What I was
wondering. principally, was if the leader of
the Governiment, could give us an idea of
what the remuneration would be for these
staffs that the Minister desires to appoint.
I should also like to know if any limit will
be fixed to the remuneration that may be
paid these wharfingers, clerks, andi se on, and
to the expenses that they may charge. Can
the ho-nourable gentleman tell us on what
basis remuneration will be paid to tbem, and
what latituâe will he allowed them with regard
te their expenses?

75

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My honourable friend bas been a Minister of the Crown,
and hie achnits that it is the Minister who
brings bis resolution to Council. .1 doubt
wbetber any member of Council weuld inter-

vene to amend a resolution covering such
a case.
He would
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
net know anything about it.
Hon. Mr, DANDURAND: True. Section
6 of the original Act provides:
The Governer in Council may appoint or
direct such officers or persons as he thinks
proper, who shall bave, under the direction
of the Minister, the charge of the works by
this Act placed under the management and
control of the Minister, and who shaîl colleet

the tolîs and dues to be paid in respect thereof.
To anyone wbo does not know wbat tbis Bihl
covers it may seem to give great latitude to
the Minister. To enligbten myseif I have read
the debate on tbe Bihl in tbe other House, and
I find that th-e amendment applies mainly te
My honourable friend while
wharfingers.
Minister of Marine administered the original
Act, and yet hie asks me te explain the
law.

There are some ports with a revenue

ranging from $1,000 te $10,000, and at Sorel
it amounts te $15,000. At those ports there
are emphoyees, other than wharfingers, ahready
working under the Act. I will obtain for my
honourable frîend full information as to the
returns received and payments made. I have
before me a table of fees, running from, one
cent up te tbirty or forty cents, wbich
wharfingers colleet and upon whieh they take
a certain commission. Detailed information
will be availabie wben we come to the committee stage.
During my

we are to go into committee on tbis Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Yes.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: If the revenue
of Sorel is $15.000 per season, on wbat hasis
will tbe staff be paid? I can well understand that if five clerks were required, and
m;isleading information reached the Minister
from. zeahous partisans interested in placing
men in positions, double tbat number might
be engaged.

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
When the former

the harbour cornrnssioners. As I understand
-1 arn speaking subict to correction-1barheur commissionors xvcre generally chosen
frorn the vicinity of the harbour. 1 do nlot
corne frorn a province in which thero are
rnany harbours, thongh Manitoba bas a barbour on the Red rixver and another at
Churchill.
Do I understand the lionourable gentlernan
to say thiat the Goveroment have the right
of patronage in relation to ail harbonrs,' but
forgot to inchnde in their first Bill the Red
river port and other ports xvhere appointrnents
rnight be necessary? To-day apparently this
î.s the attitude of the Coi ernent: "When
ilrafting onr first Bill we forgot certain ports;
so nie rnust arncnd the Act to give us the
pa tronage thcre.''
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think nibat

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: 1 niant to irnpross

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Let me repeat
nibat I have already told rny honourable
friend, that under the lani the patronage he
objects to is vested in the Governor mi Council. 1 suppose lie wihl have to accept the lani.
The only change soughit under thiis Bill is to
have thre appointrnent of wharflngcrs made
directly by the Minister.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: As 1 understand the
Bill, it is to arnend the Act so as to cxtond
the patronage to some other srnall ports.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend does nt secm to realize that under
a regirne nihieh perhaps lie prefcrred to the
present; one there nias diticulty in flnding 250
or 300 niliarfingers. Thîey were rot te bu had.
Yct my hononrable friend is indignant lest
patronage rnay be exorcised by the Minister.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: The honourable
gentleman must knoxv that if lie advertises
for a wharfinger hoe will get a hnndred apliications. But under this Bill the successful
applicant must be a supporter nf the Governnient. If the purpose of the Bill is te extend
patronage appointments for the benefit of
political supporters, I think it is altogether
wrong. I do ot see w'hy appointrnents under

CANADIAN

RED CROSS SOCIETY BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 14, an Act to amend
The Canadian Red Cross Society Act.
He raid: Honourable members, this is an
amendment to the Canadian Red Cross
Society Act. It is asked for unanimously by
the Central Council of the Society. They
claim that the membership of the Council
should be decreased fromn approximately 60 to
40, in order that the expenses in connection
with their meetings may be reduced.
Subsection 1 of section 6, as it now stands, is
amended by striking out the words, " the past
presidents of the Society, the president, the
honorary secretary, the honorary treasurer
and " in the second, thi.rd and fourth lines and
the words " fifty other " in the f ourth line, and
by inserting the word " forty " in lieu thereof;
and also by striking out the words " of whomn
not more than thirty shall be" and inserting
after the word " appointed " in the fifth uine
thereof the words " or elected "; and by
striking out the words " by the provincial divisions of the Society " in the fif th and sixth
lines thereof, and the words " and not more
than twelve members elected by the Central
Council " in the seventh and eighth lines,
thereof.
In anticipation of this amendment to the
A-ct, at the last meeting of the Central Council a by-law was unanimously adopted which
specifies the number -of members to be elected
by the provincial divisions of the Society and
by the Central Council itself.
As the effect of the am.endment to subsection 1 of section 6 is to rermove the statutory inclusion of the past pre.sidents, the president, the honorary secretary and the honorary
treasurer in the Central Council of the Society,
subsection 3 of section 6 should be brought
into line with the change so, made. Subsection
3 of section 6, as it now stands, is therefore
amended by striking out the words " the past
presidents, the oficers of the Society and of "
in the second line thereof, and by inserting
the words "or elected " after the word "appointed " in the fourth line thereof.
1 move the second reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

Senate went into Committee on the Bill.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
beginning of this section there is an error in
the date. It refers to "chapter sixty-eight of
the statutes of 1919." It should read "the
statutes of 1909." It is simply a clerical error.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I move to strike
out " 1919 " and to insert " 1909."
The proposed amendment was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. DANDUIRAND: Since we arc
making an amendment, we might make a
change in subsection 4 of new section 6, as
contained in clause 1 of the Bill. This subsecti@n says:
The Executive Committee shaîl have and
exLrcise ail the powers given by this ActThis is an expression not generally used in our
legislation, and the word " given " should he

Hon. Mr. HORLSEY moved the second
rea.ding of Bill D, an Act to incorporate
Fedieral F-ire Insurance Company of Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, on behaif
of the honourable senator from London (Hon.
Mr. Little) I have the honour to move the
second reading of this Bill. Its promoters
are the directors and some of the officers of
the company. Thiey wish to secure federal
incorporation in order that they may do business beyond the boundaries of the province of
Ontario. They intend to transfer the assets
and, business of the present company to the
new corporation. They have no intention of
increasing the capital stock, either authorized
or paid up. The diraft Bill bas been submitted to the Superîntendent of Insurance
at Ottawa, and he, I understand, bas concurred in it. 1 arn tolil that the Bill meets
the requirements of Parliament.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

Gore District Mutual Fire Insurance Company, which was incorporated under the laws
of Upper Canada ninety-eight years ago and
bas been in active operation ever since. The
company simply seeks a Dominion charter.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill

Hon. Mr. BLONDIN moved the second

Hie said: Honourable senators, on behalf
of the honourable gentleman from La Salle
(Hon. Mr. Moraud) I move second reading
of this Bill, and if the motion carnies I intend
to move afterwards a reference to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The ob.ject of the Bill is to give Dominion
incorporation to the Sterling Insurance Company of Canada, which was incorporatcd about
thirty years ago under Quebec statutes and
bas been in business ever since. I understand that the measure complies with all the
requirements of the law and that it bas been
approved by the Superintendent of Insurance.

one.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Arn I correct in
believing that 'both these insurance companies
are new companies?
Hon. Mr. HORSlEY: No. They are both
companies incorporated by the province of
Ontario, registered, with the Superintendent
of Insurance at Ottawa, and doing business
in the province. They want to do business
beyond the bounderies of the province.

Hon. Mr. BLONDIN moved the second
readîng of Bill R, an Act respecting Industrial
Loan and Finance Corporation.
He said: Honourable senators, on behaîf
of the honourable senator from La Salle (Hon.
Mr. Moraud) I move second reading of this
Bill respecting the Industrial Loan and Finance
Corporation, a company incorporated under
Dominion laws and carrying on business.
The Bill purports to make simplai, and clearer
the company's mode of operation in regard
to boans, so that the borrower will at, al
times know in advance exactly what he
will have to pay for interest and other charges.
Under its charter the company's operations
are predioated on a discount basis. Interest
on loans is deducted therefrom in advance.
That system is complîcated, because the lender
must build up special reserves for unearned
interest which is to be refunded if the boan
is repaid before the due date. Also, it is
not very clear for the borrower, for hie cannot
tell at a glance exactly at what rate the
interest is computed, for how mucli he pays
for' other charges. In addition, such a systemi
lends itself to ambiguities. It is in order to
correct these faults that the company desires

That Bill lbas six< sections, some of them

but one se1ction. Yet the honourable senator
from Laurentides (Hon. Mr. Blondin) bas

the improvemient boan is not to exceed $1,000
for each family unit, plus $1.000. The maximumi would be $5,000 if four families were to
be accommodated. The term, of the boan is
not to exceed three years if the amount is
$1.000 or lcss, nor five years if it exceeds
$1,000.
It will be observed that no security is required fromn the borroxver. His character and
income are the basis for the boan; in other
words, bis ability to repay.
Tbe end in viexv is apparent: to absorb
unemployment, especially in the building
tradtes, and to stimulate tbe construction industry. wbich bas been somewhat slow in
recovering. As a matter of fact, there was
a sligbt decline in 1936, as compared with
1935, in the total expenditure on construction work.
The experience of the United States under
the Federal Honsing Act during the last
two years bas been quite encouraging. There
bave heen 1,056,000 boans, aggregating $382,000,000. The officiai report publishcd in Julv,
1936, contains the following paragraph:
Losses of the 6,289 financial institutions

A total nf 4,333 financial
institutions reported that tlîey liad no accounts

This is an exceedingly fine record.
1 am informed that up to the end of 1936
tliere wcre S,500.000,000 borrowed under that
plan in the United States, and that private
capital must have invested $3 for every $1
borrowed. This xvould mean an expenditure

M.I. DANDURAND.

It may be that the person borrowing $1.00.0
spcnt $3.000 more on repairs.
I have no
foundation for the statement except that it
was made by the Minister of Finance. 1
myself was surprisedi at the figure.
Rîght Hon. Mr. MF 1IGHEN: It could not
be that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The discount
rate in the United States has been 5 per cent,
which at simple interest worked out to a
shade over 10 per cent. As 1 have said, our
rate of discount will be 3,1 per cent. which
works out to about 6-3 per cent.
Upon receipt of a satisfactory statemieot
from the financial institution, the Government's guarantee will be given. These guarantees will be administered direct by the
Finance Departmcnt.
The development of the whole scheme
throughout the country will be under the
supervision of the National Employment Commission. It xviii attend to the publicity or
propaganda throughi newspapers, booklets and
radijo. The cost involved in this publicity
will not fali upon the Treasury. the banks
or the borrowers, but will be fininced by
private funds secured throughi suhscription
fromi public-spirited citizens and business interests. I quite realize that some institutions
will benefit directly by these expenditures.
Sncb institutions would hclp to carry on the
work of propaganda.
Provincial comrmittees bave been appointed
throughout the country, and local advisory
conîmittees are to ho cstablishied in every
community.
One of the various duties of
thsowmte~xili be to approach the
municipal and the provincial gox eroments to
sec that the inerease in tHe value of homes
by reason of this cxpenditure xvill fot mean
an ioerecasc(l isessment. This plan may produce somne mucb needed employnment throughon C'anada. Under it, of course. we cannt
hope for a development as rapid or extensive
as appears to have taken place in the neighbouring republie. Conditions in that country
are different. It has a population of 130 millions odd. llowever, this may help in large
degree to give more lufe to building construction. I bave repeated in this Chamber,
perhaps more than once, an oId saying which
I suppose can be found in every language,
and which is as old as the langutage of France;
it runs in tbese terms: Quand le bâtiment va.
tout va-when building flourishes everything
flou rishes.
W ith these fexv remarks. I move the secondl
reading of the Bill.

FEBRUARY 17, 1937
Hon. L. McMEANS: I am nût quite clear,
after the honourable gentleman's succinct
explanation, bow -he got this matter mixed
up wit'h tihe Uni'ted States' plan. I sbouid
like to ask hlm if tbere is to be another tïost
of people appointed by the Gu-vernment,
and, if so, whether the Civil Service Commission wiil bave anything to do with their

appointment.

I cannot understand just wbat

tbe honourable gentleman means. He says
there is to be no security taken; that money
is to be ioaned on the strength. of a man's
If tihat is corret, I may say
reputation.
th-at I have very serions douhts as to the
eligihiiity of certain gentlemen who support
the Govero-ment, and of others wbo do not.
If this Bill is to result in the appointment
of more Covernment officials, 1 tbink I would
oppose it on that ground. When the late
Government introduced a measure for industrial insurance I was astounded to find that
the people of Canada wouid be caiied upon
to pay 318,000,000 for its administration.

fromn some rather vague information appearing in the newspapers that -thsi banks of
Canada were going to finance this scheme. and
that the Government was going to guarantee
the banks to a certain extent. This measure
proposes somnething entireiy different.
Perhaps the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
right, bonourable leader of my honourable
friend (Righýt Hon. Mr. Meighen) can give
the honourable gentleman the explanation he
desires.

before they advance the mýoney, and they wil

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourabie members, I fuily support not merely
the second reading of tihis Bill, but its
reference to committee, because I think i't.
phraseology and construction can be improved.
As I have said on more thýan one occasion,
the commission seieoted for this purpose is a
gooýd commission. This, in my judgment. is
mainly because of its extremely able chairman.
I desire, however, to make some reference
to remarks on the resuits of the measure as
disclosed by the leader of the House. Apparentiy a sum approximating a miliion and a
quarter or a little moreHon. Mr. DýANDURAND:

It is more now.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: -has already
been borrowed by various home improvers
throughout the country, and I do not doubt
that probabiy 80 per cent of this sum is
,reflected in the earnings of the workers of
this Dominion. That wouid aggregate neariy
a million, or possibly a littie more, which
would go into the pockets of working people
of one class or another; a total of ten cents
for every inhabitant of our country. It is
by no means great, but it is something, and
no doubt these figures will be very ranch enlarged as time goes on. I do not anticipate,
tbough, that they will ever reach sucb dimensions as to have a very pronounced effect
upon the aggregate of empioyment in this
country. I can see that in ail certantynot probabiity-sqome portion of this money

84

SENATE

would have been spent on improvements anyway, whbether there was a stauite or not. There
are people who are able to borrow money for
improving their homes, and from day to day
and weok to week throughout the year, ail
over the country, people are doing this. Novertheless the ntimber of persons who improve
their homes will undoubtedly be enlarged
by the operation of the statute.
The hoinourable gentleman suggested that
other expenditures would be traceable to those
maide under his scherne. I know the source
of thiat opinion: it was advanced by the
Minister of Finance. But for the life of me
I cannot attach any meaning to it at ail.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
States.

In the United

Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If it were
ihe case there it would be the case here.
Just why B, inspired by A's borrowing under
this Bill. is going to dig ino his own pocket
and spend three dollars for every one that
A borrowed, I do not know. Relationship
between one expenditure and the other simply
does not exist. That suggestion is an attempt
to make the measure appear more important
than it really is.
Thet honourable gentleman also said that
through advisory committees of the commission-and certainly there are in this organization enough advisory committees, superimposed and underimposed committees, to achieve
things-an effort was now being made to bring
about an arrangement with municipalities,
no doubt through provincial co-operation
whereby improvements made to homes under
this Bill would not be taxed. I cannot see
any reason at ail for such a move. Why
should these improvements not be taxed?
I think the Government of Canada is wise
in providing special means to assist people to
make repairs to their beuses. But if somebody repairs his house without such assistance,
does it by an enterprising stroke of his own,
and on his own resources. why should he be
taxed on his improvements while improvements made by a man who got Government
aid are exempted from taxation? I can hardly
believe a commission under Mr. Purvis would
ask for such a thing.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
is a good reason for that.

I think there

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
I cannot
ser it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will my right
honourable friend allow me? There are hundreds of municipalities where taxation bas
reached such a point that it seems to taxpayers to be unbearable.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Certainly.

Hon. Mr. DANI)URAND: That being so, it
is suggestd that the good, men and true who
are being asked to give of their time without
remuneration, and exen to give of their own
ioney, towards absorbing the unemployed,
should tr' to have their muînicipalities agree
that inereased values arising through expenditures onder operations of this Act shall not
be taken advantage of as sources of increased
taxation. They will say to municipalities and
provinces: "Kindly help. We are striving to
have hundreds of thousands of unemployed
put back to work. Towards tbat end arrangenents have been made whereby money will be
supplied by banks and the federal treasury for
repairs to homes. Will you please help by
refraining from taxing these improvements?"
It is simply a kind of community plan under
whieh publie-spirited citizens on these advisory
committecs, who are exerting themselves in
an effort to find work for people at present
unemployed, will appeal to municipalities to
help this worthy cause by not taking advantage of expenditures for home improvements.
Right lon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am afraid
I am not persuaded. Some people will be
helped by this measure, and the honourable
leader bases a special claim to further help
for them from municipalities on the fact that
many good citizens are assisting in regard to
expenses, publicity and so on, of the Employment Commission. I do not sec any relation
there. I was arguing against this proposai
on the ground of discrimination. It would be
a good thing if munieipalities could exempt
from taxation all improvements to homes and
to premises of business firms who are enterprisin enough to have improvements made.
But how could a municipality justify relieving
one clas-s. who already are being helped, and
refusing to relieve another class, who are not
being helped at ail?
TIon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think they all
would be relieved at the same time.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If there is one
institution in Canada which is in no position
to give such relief, however gratifying it might
be to recipients, to banks and to persons assisting the Employment Commission, it is the
municipality. Of ail who have had to suffer
from the depression, municipalities have suffered most. I have always been in favour of
municipal control of and responsibility for
unemployment relief, though ail the time I
have known that relief has heaped terrifie
burdens upon municipalities. But the necessity of maintaining local control is so important that nothing else could b done. I should
like to sec outside help applied, net to ease

FEBRUARY 17, 1937
municipalities of their burden of relief, but to
ease municipal taxpayers of the general
burden. I arn thinking of something in the
way of an allowance of a certain percentage
of real estate tax, perhaps, with no interruption in the direct responsibility of municipalities to keep down relief within their borders.
Local control i.s vital in a matter such as
relief. However, I arn somewhat off the
track. My point is t.hat you cannot justly
ask a municipality to distinguish in favour
of borrowers frorn banks under this measure as
againat citizens who make improvements without assistance under the measure.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

1 admit that.

Righit Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: It cannot be

position to relieve ahl improvernents .,taxation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But they are

municipalities exempt ail improvements there
will be a reduction in the aggregate assessment because of deterioration, -and if that is
not cornpensated for by increased assessment,
where are municipalities going to land? I
have great confidence in the judgment of the
Chairman of the Employment Commission
and' 1 cannet think he is lending bimself to
demands of this kind.
While I arn on rny feet I want to refer te
a ,tatement that I made at the opening of
1 e session. At that time, referring to this
t3il1, I intirnated that public announcement
had been made by the Governent of an
appropriation of $50,000,000 to cover its
guarantees. I was not wrong in rny statement, for that announcement was made and
I read it; but the announcement was wrong.
Now 1 find the Governrnent's responsibility
runs not to $50,000.0O0, but only to $7,500,OOO,,
that.is, 15 per cent of the total amount contemplated to be ultimately loaned under this
measure. I question whether loans will reach
thut sum, because in this country there is not
as much incentive to lend on the part of
Iending institutions as there is in the United
States. Nor do I think there should be; I
believe it is wise that the rate should be kept
down. The effective rate now is about 6-3
per cent. With bookkeeping that banks will
have to do in connection with boans there
wvill net be much profit for themn at that rate,
and therefore not much incentive for them;
te spread money out very widely under this
mieasure. And of course the money will
really have te corne frein banks. However,

the more that is donc under this Bill the
better. Every man employed means a gain;
every new oppertunity for employment tends
to reduce the incidence of the relief problem.
But I stili cannot see why the tremendous
and elaborate rnachinery of the commission
was needed to produce this measure. The
measure is good. The United States has had
one exactiy like it in effect for two or three
years, but in that country it was not precedýed
by such a commission. Why could not the
Canadian Governrnent have been equally resourcefu!? It had the advantage of being able
to study the American measure and of knowing
what the experience with that measure had
been. Ail that I complained cf in the first
place wys that this extensive machinery
bad been established, and big manifestes were
spreadi throughout the country aibout tremendous efforts that were te be made, when
the Government was in a position te do al
that this mach-inery could do; when, indeed,
it was the business of the Government te do
it. Where can we turn in Canada to-day
without finding a Government commissien?
Can anyone cast his eye in any direction in
our ceuntry witheut discovering one in operation? Is there any province, even. that bas
net one? Concerning the Grain Exchange we
have had a royal commission every few
years, certainly-I was geing te say, every
few months--as far back as I cao remember,
ail examining into exactiy the samne thing.
We hard]y get threugh with one before another
15 appointedi. The present commission is going
over ail the evidence, hearing ail the witnesses,
travelling and tramping ever exactly the samne
ground that its predecessors, te the number
of haîf a dozen, did in years gene by. And
because of a steppage of work in some factory,
a Textile Commission was appointed, and it is
still cemmissioning. As far as 1 can sec it is
geing te keep on commissioning. Lawyers are
employed at good payHue. Mr. MeMEANS:

Certainly.

RIght Hon. Mr. MEIGUEN: These lawyers
seemi te feel it is their duty to use Government money, meney of this country, te prepagate their particular tariff beliefs here, there
and everywhere. The Treasury ef the country
is being expioited in order that tariff principles,
s0 called, or tariff prejudices, or whatever yen
like te eall them, may be spilled thronghout
the Dominion by lawyers acting for one of
these commissions. 1 will net naine them ail,
but I venture te say that at least four or
five commissions are now travelling across our
territery. and 1 arn told another is in course
of incubation.

SENATE

86

My suggestion is that we should get away
from this kind of thing. We do not need all
these commissions. The cost of them is
terrific. One commission, appointed by the
Province of Ontario, is now examining into
conditions at a reformatory. We in Ontario
shall have to pay for this one. It is taking
evidence from young convicts; has been
listening to a whole string of them for days.
What the purpose can be I do not know,
or what chance there is of being further
ahead when the investigation is finished thao
when it began. At the same time there is
a federal commission inquiring into conditions at penitentiaries and listening to grievances of convicts, at a cost to taxpayers
of from five hundred to one thousand dollars
a day. This country has many honest workers'
grievances to attend to, of far more importance
to the taxpayers of the Dominion than the
grievances of convicts.
Hear, hear.

Some Hon. SENATORS:

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have, I
know, covered a sphere wider than the Bill.
I like the Bill, I like the conduct of the
commission. and i have great confidence in
the chairman; but I do not think we ought
to have a Government in Ottawa, with certain
specific duties, delegating those duties to a
dozen commissions spread all over our country,
at the, expense of the taxpayers of the
Dominion.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The right honourable gentleman's last remark does not bear
on the administration of this Bill.

I am rather
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
surprised tiat the services of my honourable
friend from Winnipeg have not been requisitioned. No one knows what loss may
be involved in the 15 per cent guarantee which
the Government is giving to the lending institutions. It may reach the maximum of
$7,500,000, and it may be only a paltry sum.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I am afraid the
honourable gentleman does not understand
my question. Applications for loans must be
passed upon by some officials. Those officials
mïust be paid by the Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No; my honourable friend is in error. The borrower applies
directly to the bank, or to some other financial institution approved by the Hon. Minister of Finance. If the lending institution,
after making the necessary inquiries as to
character and solvency, decides to lend him
$1,000 or $2,000, as the case may be, it
apprises the honourable Minister of the fact.
If his department is satisfied that the proposed loan comes within the regulations to
be made under the measure, then approval is
given and the Government is responsible to
the lending institution for the 15 per cent.
The procedure is very simple, as the borrower has not to find an endorser or give
any security; he has merely to state his
needs to the lending institution, and if the
loan is granted the lending institution will
be responsible for 85 per cent of the loan.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Who advises the
Hon. Minister of Finance on the transaction?

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: A good deal
of what I said does not bear on it.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Would the honourable gentleman give me an answer to my
question: what is this thing going to cost
the taxpayer? I am a taxpayer.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I suppose he
will assume that the approved lending institution has taken the necessary precautions. He
has simply to see that the loan comes under
the terms of the Bill and the regulations as
drafted by hais department.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The case is exceptional, I know, but I think I can boast
that the whole machinery for the administration of the Bill will cost nothing.

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Surely the honourable gentleman knows from experience that
no Minister of Finance can pass upon the
millions of loans which may be sought under
the Bill. There must be a separate organization to advise him on loan applications. I
do not think there can be any doubt about
that.

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:

Nothing?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

No.

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I am very glad to
hear that. but I think the honourable gentleman is mistaken.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The National
Employment Commission has called upon men
of standing in the various communities to
give their services for nothing.
I have not met
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
any of them in my experience.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: The banks take
the responsibility of passing on loans.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:

To what extent?

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: To the extent
that the Bill provides. The honourable leader
of the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) said a
moment ago that the National Employment
Commission would not cost the Government a

FEBRUARY 17, 1937
cent. That is quite correct as far as the
personnel is concerned; but I think my honourable friend will admit that the commission 's
travelling and hotel expenses and clerical
staff are a charge upon the Treasury.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I was not covering that point. 1 was asked how much. this
organization would cost to pass on loans.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Yes, and the
honourable gentleman said it would flot cost
the Government a cent.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I said it would
not cost anything; but the National Employrnent Commission is doing other work
than that. It supervises, it helps, it appoints
provincial advisory committees. The commission covers a much wider field, and I took
it for granted that the honourable gentleman's question covered operations under the
Bill.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Honnurable members,
I think much of this discussion is entirely
unnecessary, as evidently loans for the purposes authorized by this Bill have already
been made. Apparentby the Government has
been carrying on under a "blank cheque."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes; but it is
for this House to accept or reject the Bill.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Does the 15 per cent
guarantee apply to each boan or to the
aggregate amount of loans?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: To the aggregate.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: There is, it seems to
me, a good deal of difference between the
two. if the iabibity of the Government is
to be 15 per cent of the aggregate amount of
boans made, a bank would be rebieved of boss
on a boan that might become a wash-out.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If the bank
loans $2,000, and the boan is not recoverable,
it wibl bose 85 per cent of that boan.
Right Hon. MT. MEIGHEN: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: A 15 per cent guarantee
on each boan, which I should say is reasonable,'
woubd provide tlie bank with a fair margin;
but if the guarantee envers the aggregate of
boans made. then in the case of a wash-out
boan of $2,000 the bank woubd be paid the
full býoss under the guarantee.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It would be
paid 15 per cent.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: No; my honourabie friend is wrong. If that were the
case if woubd be far better for the Government
and far worse foyr the banks. But that is net

87

the case. The unit is the institution, not the
boa.n. Suppose the Bank of Montreal makes
oight loans, seven of which prove to be gond
and one a total loss. The bank dýoes not lose
a nickel; the G.overniment takes the whole
boss. I am flot saying if is wrnng. but if is a

Io' bet-ter foi- tLý-e
ý,ood on iLs owvn feet. The bank lias a Inargin
of 15 per cent, and theTefore has to lose 15
per cent on the whole business before if boses
a nickel i'tself. As far as safety is concerned,
the bank i.s in a pretýty comfortable position;
but if does a gond deal of work for the rate
of inferest received.
When is the Government going to nome te
the accoun'ting period and arrive at the los.
it is t0 bear? On this point the Bill is silent.
Thle loaning operations may last for ten
years. Are we to wait until the end of that
period. before anything is d'une on the piart
of the Govern'ment? I do net think so. I
t1hink the banks wilb fix acounting periods just
as offen as they can ýand get t-he Government'a
mnney. Under the Bill the Government can
run on indefinitely beforýe if notifies institutin
A or B, "YKu are nof te, make any more
bcans after the lst of Febyruary,"--.or snme
other date. I venture to say the loaning
operaf ions will not con very long before the
banks will demand that an accounting perind
be fixed and 'the basses then be put into a
reserve, and that reserve applied tn the full
extent of the Government's liability. I think
the Bill ouglit te be explicit on the point.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: When I read the
Bill and the explanations given by the Hon.
Minister of Finance, I reabized that this was
an important question. When if was put to
him lie answered that the 15 per cent applied
fo boans in the aggregate. A question arose as
to wheýn the loss would be estimated. It is a
continuing process, and I cannot exacfly see
when the Government will say, "Nnw, we
want an accounting."

It has been stated that the loss will be

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, the banks.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I saw a statement that such was the decision of the Department of Finance. as it would then be sure
of the full co-operation of the banks in furthering the scheme. I suppose it implies that
the banks will be on the right side of the
transaction.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Is the honourable
gentleman sincere when he says the administration of this Bill will not cost the taxpayers
anything at all? Does he mean to say that
although the Government may have to pass on
millions of loans of which it will guarantee
15 per cent, this will net necessitate the
appointment of a host of officials? Does he
still say this will not cost the taxpayer anything at all?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I take it for

the necessary staff for the purpose. If one or
two more clerks are neededHon. Mr. McMEANS:

settlement scheme. By comparison I should
think any loss under this 15 per cent guarantee will be a drop in the bucket. I do net
sec why anyone who would be accepted as a
good risk under this Bill could net borrow
money for home improvements from private
sources.
The purpose of the measure undoubtedly is good; there can be no question
about that; but I am inclined to think that
its administration will necessitate considerable
outlay for clerical assistance and travelling and
other expenses. As to the 15 per cent guarantee, the Governnent is safeguarded, becauîse
the improvements made will add te the value
of the security. Indeed, the Government
should not Jose a cent.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable member is mistaken. Neither the Government nor the bank has anyv security on
the building.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: But if the borrower is in default the Government or the
bank can take legal action and recover the

lon. Mr. ARTHURS:
Honourable senators, so far as the liabilitv of the Government is concerned, it is undoubtedly 15 per
cent on the aggregate of the loans made.
Clause 4 reads:
In no case shall the liability of the Governnietit of Canada in respecet of guarantees given
under this Act to any approved lending institution exceed fifteen per centunm of the aggregate
aimount of lomie improvement loans made by
any suehi
approved lending institution.
The idea seems to prevoil that the loans
will be made solelv by our chartered banks,
but that is not the case. The Bill proviles
that loans may be made by banks or other
approved lending institutions. I can sec some
danger in respect to that. For instance, many
of our insurance companies have millions of
dollars loaned on homes in Toronto and other
cities. To my personal knowledge manv of
those homes in Toronto have been in need
of repairs for the last five or six years. Their
owners will certainly take advantage of this
Bill to secure boans in order to make necessary
repairs. As a result the Government will in
effect be protecting the mortgagees. to the extent of 15 per cent of the aggregate of such
Joans, and the mortgagees will benefit pro-

appointient or selection of delegates?
Bon. Mr. DANDURAND: The answer to
the bonourable gentleman's inquiry is as

follows:
1. Yes.
2, 3 and 4. The Government has intimated
its intention of asking five members of the
Senate and Bouse of Commons holding

officiai parliamentary postis, including the
Speaker of the Senate and the two leaders of
the Senate, to form part of the officiai Canadian delegation to the Coronation. In addition, the United Kingdom Branch of the
Empire Parliamentary Association bas indicated its desire to invite eight members in
ail of the Senate and Bouse of Commons to
proceed to London and take part in the meetings of the association during the Coronation
period, as its guests.
5, 6 and 7. Answered by above.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I did flot quite
catch the answer the honourable gentleman
made to that part of my inquiry as to wbether
the Senate selected or had anything to say
about the selection of its own delegates. I
asked that question because we are a representative body, and I had an impression-a
vague one, perhaps--that we should have
something to say as to who are going to be
our delegates.
PRIVATE BILLS
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. HORSEY moved the second reading of Bill T, an Act to incorporate Toronto
General Insurance Company.
Be said: Bonourable senators, in the absence
of the honourable senator from North York
(Bon. Sir Allen Aylesworth), 1 bave the
bonour of moving second reading of this Bill.
It is an insurance Bill, similar to severai that
were given second reading on Monday evening last. The company bas provincial incorporation and desires autbority te do business
beyond the province. The intention is that
when a federal charter is received the business
and assets of the present company will be
transferred to the new one, and that the
existing provincial charter wili ha surrendered.
I understand the draft Bill bas met witb
approval of the Superintendent of Insurance
and that ail regulations of the Parliament of
Canada bave been complied witb.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
SECOND READING

Rigbt Hon. Mr. GRAHAM moved the second
reading of Bill U, an Act to incorporate the
Sons of Scotland Benevolent Association.
He said: Bonourabie senators, this Bill is
to some extent like the insurance bills that
bave been given second reading. The objeet
of the measure is to give federal incorporation
to the Sons of Scotland Benevoient Association,

whicb bas been doing business under provincial charter for haîf a century. The institution is perfectly solvent, and intends to trans-

Hon. Mr. McMEANS, Chairman of the
Comrnittee on Divorce, moved the second
reading of Bill R, an Act for the relief of
Charlotte Opal Moore Norton.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Honourable senators,
before this Bill passes I should like to ask the'
Chairman of the Committee (Hon. Mr. McMeans) whether there ivas a difference of
opinion in the committee in regard to granting
the application. 1 have read the evidence ami
have corne to the conclusion that there was
collusion between the petitioner and the'
respncent. For that reason I think the Bill
should not be proceeded with.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: The only information I cao give the honourable gentleman is
that the report of the committee has been
filed, and if specifies whtther the decision was
unanirnous or not. There has been no dufference of opinion in the comrnittee with
respect to any petitions which have been
dealt with so far this session. I do not
recaîl this particular case, but if the honourable gentleman bas any doubt of the bona
fide.. of tuie petition hie may discuss the Bill
on the motion for third reading, or hie may
objeet f0 the presenit motion.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I will reserve my
objection until the Bill cornes before the
House for third reading. In the meantirne, 1
would ask honourable senators to read the,
evidence. The parties were married in the,
United States. I think they were dorniciled in
Canada for sorne years, but whether they are
citizens of this country I do not know. Frorn
my reading of the evidence I have corne to
the conclusion that the case is a "frarne-up,
and that a divorce should not be granted.
The motion was agreed f0, and the Bill
was read the second tirne.

DIVORCE BILLS
THIRD READINGS

On niotion of Hon. Mr. MeMeans, Chairman of -the Committee on Divorce, the following Bills were read the third tume, and passed
on division:
Bill 0, an Act for the relief of Charles
Marali Doxsey.
Bill P, an Act for the relief of Phyllis Stanners Kitchin, otherwise known as Judith Stanners Kitchin.
Bill Q, an Act for the relief of Ivy Jackson Beaulne.
Bill S, an Act for the relief of Mildred
Tannenbaum Sufrin.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS, Chairman of the
Committee on Divorce, moved the third
reading of Bill R, an Act for the relief of
Charlotte Opal Moore Norton.
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable sesiators,
I have some observations to make before t.his
motion is voted on. I read soie tume ago
a report in the Toronto newspapers that certain judges of the Supreme Court of Ontario
had sta-ted that in their opinion a large percentage-I thi.nk they put it as high as 70 or
80 per cent-of t.he divorce cases that came
I my view
before theni were collusive.
it would be fair to assume that about the
sanie percentage applies to the divorce petitiens which corne before the Parliament of
Canada. Collusion is bard. indeed it je
almost impossible, to prove, because the principals natura'lly will not admit,' even under
oath, that tbey bave agreed to seek divorce.
It would be inconsistent on their part to
make any such admission, for it would defeat
the object they have in view.
I understand that in the courts the judges
decide cases according to the evidence. I
do not know whether the saine principle would
apply to the Divorce Committee and to the
Senate itself. If it does, you can- easily see
that where there is collusion and it is denied,
the courts and the Parliament of Canada are
merely registering bodies giving legal effeet
te what is unlawful.

lf1

I think there was collusion ini this case, and
that the-refore the BiHl should be rejected. I
shall give my reasons, very ba'iefly. According
to the evidtnce, the parties agreed to separate,
and the lmsband promised to give the wife
$50 a week for five years, and afterwards;
$25 a week.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: What is wrong with
that?
Han. Mr. HUGHES: I arn simply stating
the ternis of the agreement. Each honourable member can d.raw bis own conclusion.
The next step was that, as is usual in such
cases, Mr. Norton, the respondent, went to a
hotel with a woman, not bis wife, and they
registered as Mr. and Mrs. Norton. They
were assigned a rooni. Two detectives
shadowed them to the hotel-the usual proThese detectives enga.ged a rooni

admitted; no delay at ail; no questions
asked. It would appear as if Mr. Norton
had been expecting them. They say they
found him standing in the room nearly undressed, and the womnan was in bed, aiso
nearly undressed. They asked Mr. Norton,
"Is this woman your wife?" "Certainly,"
was bis answer. Wbat other answer could hie
give in the circumstances? Then tbe detectives retired to the lobby, where they waited
for about an hou.r, until tJhey saw Mr. Norton
and the woman leave the hotel. That is the
evidence given before the committee. It
does not prove that adultery was committed.
Perhaps such proof was not necessary. I
suppose it would be reasonable to infer that
there was misconduet. I understand th-at
cases of this kind are common in England.
Organizations Vihere make a busineas of
supplying-at a price-co-respondents w'hose
standing in society is similar to that of the
petitioners. I read as to one such divorce
case in the English courts that in a later
action the responsible parties swore that
aduttery had neyer been committed.
It would appear that the courts and the
Parliament of Canada are simply at the
meriey of married couples who, having made
up their minds to get a divorce, tîhereupon
follow the saine procedure as in this case.
lit is a tremendous evil in my opinion, and
there ought to he somne way of combating
it. Divorce and its concomitant evils have
been the main factors in the destruction
of ail nations of antiquity that have perished
from the eanth. Divorce destroys the family,
the unit on whioh the State rests. It wi14

TRIBUTES

TO, DECEASED

SENATORS

TIHE LATE SENATORS HOCKEN AND BURNS

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, one of our colîcagues, Senator
Hocken. bas suddenly left us. As tbe news of
bis demise and that of bis wife reached me,
I repeated to myself: What shadows we are!
This thought often recurs to my mind when a
colleague wbo for years bas moved in our
midst, strong in body and in spirit, is suddeuly called away by deatb.
The days roll on and the procession carnies
us inevitably to our last post. Natural is
the effect of time on our minds. While in

U

the prime of life we are wont to be active,
energetic, enthusiastic-at times aggressive.
To one witb strong convictions is often
ascribed a spirit of intoleýance. But we are
apt to mellow as age creeps on.
Such was the case with Senator Hocken.
Fromn reading his writings and sayings, I had
the impression that 1 should behold a plumed
knight witb sword aloft, always ready to
charge. To my surprise I saw a gentie, meek
septuagenarian, kindly and even deferential.
It was a touching siglit to observe Senator
Hocken and bis belpmate moving about arrn
in arm, gently leaning upon each other to
thr last day of their lives.
Senator Horken had a notable career as
pi-inter and journalist, as alderman and mýayor
of Toronto, and as a member of Parliament.
To his family I desire to extend the sympathy of the Senate.
We have just heen apprised of the death
of Senator Patrick Burns. 11e had been iii
for some two years. Senator Burns was one
of the most interesting pioneers of the West.
I do flot know what were bis beginnings. but
I see that he was from Oshawa in the good
old province of Ontario. I had heard of him
and of his activities before I visited the
West, and when I passed through the Western Provinces as far as the coast, I saw bis
name everywhere in every town and village.
H1e had been a rancher in a large way; lie
then erected abattoirs. and followed that yenture by becoming a packer, distributing bis
goods far and wide. 11e also became a chainstore prince. It could be said of him that lie
raised and distributed bis cattie from the boof
to the dinner table. His activities also extended to the East, where be sat on many
important boards. His life is a lesson for
presenit and future generations, and shouid
be beld out as an example to the children
and the students in our sehools and colleges.
I desire to extend the sympathy of tbe
Senate to bis mourning relatives and friends.
Riglit Hon. ARTHUR MEIGIIEN: Honourable senators, a more faitbful compendium
of the career of Senator Burns than that
which we bave just heard fromn the leader of
the Government would be difficult indeed to
compose.
The senjator's passing was not wholly unexpe-cted. For mnany months 'le stood bravely
on the edge of tihe grave, and lis Iast long
struggle for life was witnessed in tender
sympathy by t-bousands upon thousands of
those, particularly in the West of Canada,
who had learned to love and to follow him.
One's mind goes back to the little school
near Kirkfield, just *a few miles north of
Toronto, where as a country boy Senator

94

SENATE

Burns attended for but a short lime. Curiously
unough, another great Canadian, Sir William
Mackenzie, alîondod this little red sohool a.t
the same tîme. Ofîen have I beard Senator
Burns tel of ail his difficulties as a little
lad being sotîled by the master mmnd of the
Kohool, the rien Billy Mackenzie. Intercating il is îLot as tîteir lu'es unfolded, both in
a big and mastorful way, they were still
associsîed. When Sonsior Burns launched bis
tremendous enterprise in Western Canada bis
great second was Sir William Mackenzie,
whoso intorest in tbat eniorpriso continued 10
the day of bis death.
I rhink il is now about fifîy yoars sînce

where, with

only strong convictions, but strong prejudices.
Often, I lament to have to say, I heard him
described as a bigot. I do not know anyone
much farther from that category. During
all of his life he was a strong churchman,
and through most of it a church worker, in an
active and enthusiastic way. He had in his
heart no enmity to any church; it was full
of generosity and sympathy for all religious
effort. But he always had a very determined
view, a clear and definite opinion, as to the
line of demarcation between the activities
of church and of state, and in laying out that
line and driving home among the people
what he felt to be the correctness of his
view thereon, so zealous was his advocacy
that it unhappily and without warrant gave
rise to an impression that he was narrow.
Senator Hocken was beloved by those who
knew him. His best public work, of course,
was done before he reached this House, and
that work was mainly municipal. He was a
good alderman, a good mayor, a man who left
a fine reputation after the discharge of every
public office, a member of Parliament never
defeated, as acceptable at the close of his
career as he was welcome at the beginning.
One does not, however, reach a faithful
estimate of the character and. work of Senator
Hocken without taking into account the place
his wife occupied in his life. She was the
source of his comfort and his happiness, the
fountain of his ambition, the inspiration of
his career, the companion through all vicissitudes and along every step of his journey.
For fifty-seven years they walked hand in
hand. and ,at the last even the stern Messenger
of Death was powerless to divide them.
Stricken within the walls of this building not
many days ago, he was carried soon after to
his home. Gallantly he struggled, as would
any truc man, for return to the bright day.
But lying not far from him his wife also was
passing through the valley, and when tidings
reached his mind that she had resigned this
anxious life, he gave up the battle, wrapped
the curtains round him and lay down to quiet
sleep. Under bright winter skies, surrounded
by sorrowing friends, the two were buried
last Saturday in the same grave. I am sure
our sympathies go out to the remaining son
died on the fielde of Franee--and to
-one
the two daughters who have lost so much.
Hon. D. E. RILEY: Honourable members,
I should like to add my humble tribute to
what bas been said by the leaders on both
sides with regard to Senator Burns, who
passed away this morning. I knew the late
senator for almost half a century. I knew
him when he was leading the rugged and
strenuous life of a cattleman in the early

95

days of the West, where true values are
perhaps more readily assessed, and through
all the changing years since that time we
were close friends. Although this is a sad
occasion for me, I am glad and proud at this
time and in this place to stand and say of
my old friend: He was a good man in every
sense of the word.
The late Senator Burns had a full measure
of the pioneer spirit. A plain and simple man
in the finer sense of the term, he was endowed
with a vision and an almost uncanny foresight; and this, coupled with courage to back
his opinions, placed him in the front rank
of Canada's business men. To most of us he
was known as a cattleman, and he was a
cattleman in a large way. His operations
extended over a tremendous territory: on
the Pacific coast to the Yukon, in the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and
Saskatchewan. Though we think of him as a
cattleman, his business activities were almost
as varied as the resources of the vast territory
in which he operated. In fact, the history
and early development of Western Canada
and the life history of the late senator are
very closely interwoven.
In politics he took little active part, but
he was always a prominent figure in the
public life of his adopted province. His death
removes one of the outstanding pioneers and
personalities of Western Canada. We shall
miss his cheery greeting and the unfailing
optimism and faith in his adopted province
that were so often encouragement and inspiration to many a struggling pioneer. We
all shall miss him: the members of this
Chamber who had the privilege of knowing
him will miss his wise counsel; his business
associates will miss him; but above all he
will be missed by the poor people of the West,
where he lived so long, to whom he had endeared himself by his kindly and generous
spirit.
I join with those who have already spoken
in extending our sincere sympathy to his
bereaved relatives.
Hon. HENRY A. MULLINS: Honourable
members, it was with the deepest regret that
I learned of the passing of my old friend and
business associate, Senator Burns. He was
commonly known on the open ranges as Pat
Burns; we referred to him in no other way.
I had a great many business deals with
Burns, from the days when we pioneered in
and near Minnedosa, in my constituency in
Western Canada; deals that amounted to
many thousands of dollars; but I never had a
dispute of any kind with him, in any manner,
shape or form. I remember one transaction
in which we sold the Waldron ranch cattle to

95u

SENATE

him. That deal was made in two minutes,
and the agreement was fully and faithfully
carried out by Mr. Burns. His word was his
bond.
He was truly an old pioneer of the Western
country. From the days of the oxen, when
we all were struggling out there, Burns fought
every inch of the way to the position he
finaily attained and in the upbuilding of the
great business that bore his name.
He left Manitoba and went out to the
open ranges of the West, where he pioneered
with my friend from High River (Hon. Mr.
Riley), and he helped to build up that country . As my honourable friend has said, he
will be missed by the poor people. He had
a big beart, and everybody knew of the
kindliness of Pat Burns to the poor of the
district in which he lived.
May I also make a brief reference to my
other old friend, Senator Hocken, whom I
saw laid to rest last Saturday? I was a
member of the House of Commons with him,
and I know there was no kinder person
whom you could meet in the corridor or anywhere else. I felt it sorely when I saw him
placed away in the same grave with his wife,
in that old-time cemetery in Toronto.
The passing of these two old pioneers struck
me so forcibly that I could net refrain from
paying my tribute to them. We cannot
afford to lose any of our pioneers at the
present time, honourable members, because
they are needed more now than they ever
were, on account of the situation which faces
this country. More than ever before we need
our pioneers te help us steer this ship of state
along a safe course.

HOME IMPROVEMENT LOANS
GUARANTEE BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading of Bill 11, an Act to iccrease employment by encouraging the repair of rural and
urban homes.
Hon. L. McMEANS: Honourable members,
J have no desire to raise any factional opposition to this Bill, but I want to ask the
Covernment when there is going to be an
end to this kind of paternal legislation. A
short time ago I was considering what result
such legislation had had upon the country.
In my own province, Manitoba, there was
passed an Act called the Farm Loan Board
Act. The result of that has been so appalling
that I should be ashamed to mention it in
this House. Large numbers of farmers came
to the Board and borrowed every dollar they
could, and when they had to pay taxes and
interest they abandoned their farms because
they could go and rent at very much lower
cost. Now, what benefit did that Act confer?
Another enterprising member of the Government introduced the Rural Credits measure,
under which certain sections of the community
were to elect members to form a committee
for the purpose of advancing money to buy
stock. What was the result? The losses were
so heavy that I do not feel like mentioning
the figures. Then there was another piece
of legislation, called the Winkler Cow Act,
which had the same result. Not one dollar
of benefit ever came to anyone in the province in connection with those measures. These
tremendous losses impose a very heavy burden of taxation upon the people. If the
present rate of increase in taxation continues,
the day will soon come when very few will
be able to pay taxes. I understand that in
the city of Winnipeg only 30 per cent of the
residents are paying taxes.
It will be remembered that the Dominion
Government advanced $80,000,000 to put
returned soldiers on the land. I think the
right honourable leader on this side of the
House (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
was
responsible for that legislation. A year or
two later their farms were revalued, and the
Covernment lest some $40,000,000.
These
losses can be met only by taxation, and the
burden is placed upon the man who gets no
benefit and no encouragement under this
paternal legislation. I could mention several
other cases, but I will not detain honourable members.

FEBRUARY 25, 1937
I have perused this Bill aad. I cannot
understand how the individual is going to
benefit. To my mind it would be far better
to pass a measure to discourage our people
from borrowing any more money. When the
honourable leader of the Government introduced this Bill I asked him if he could give
the House any idea of the cost of administration, but I got no answer.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, I gave the
honourable gentleman an answer, and I shall
repeat it in a moment.

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Then I must accept
the honourable gentleman's answer, but I shall
do so with a great deal of doubt, for it will be
hard for him to convince me that you can
guarantee the immense amount of money that
may be loaned under this Bill without incurring further losses and increasing the number of Government officials. I am inclined to
think that by next session the honourable
gentleman will have changed his mind.
As I said before, I do not desire to offer
any factional opposition, but I do suggest the
time is coming when we must calH a halt to
this paternal legislation; otherwise the taxpayers of this country will find it impossible
to meet their tax bills. As a matter of fact,
to-day nearly one-half of the population are
working to maintain the other half; that is,
they have to meet the principal burden of
administration and other costs.
I think last session I called the attention
of honourable members to a Bill introduced
in the other House to regulate our old friend
the Canadian hen. That Bill was enacted,
and under the regulations based thereon she
could lay eggs only of a certain size. While
the Bill was passing through this House I
asked the honourable leader of the Government what it would cost to carry out the
system of regulation. It was stated at 200,000
a year. I suppose it is costing more to-day.
The matter was brought home to me by a
little incident which occurred in Winnipeg. A
woman in the neighbourhood who operated
a small chicken farm traded two dozen eggs
with a local grocer for some tea. He put
the eggs on his counter. In a day or two a
Government inspector came along and had
him arrested on the charge that the eggs were
smaller than the regulation size, and should
not be sold. The Government is employing
hordes of officials all over the country to
enforce regulations passed under paternal legislation, and the burden on the people is
becoming wiell-nigh insupportable. I warn
my honourable friend opposite that if much
further legislation of this kind is put on the

Statute Book the cost of administration will
be more than our taxpayers can bear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senators, I need not repeat why this legislation is before the House. We all know that
the country is facing the problem of reemploying hundreds of thousands of workmen who are on direct relief at the expense
of municipal and provincial authorities. The
National Employment Commission has suggested this scheme to encourage the building
and renovation of houses, and so stimulate
building and other industries, whose activity
will in turn lead to further employment. A
similar scheme in operation in the United
States for the past two years has created a
movement iwhich, to a degree, has diminished
unemployment. The diminution is partly due
to the fact that under the Act people have
been able to borrow money to make repairs to
their homes in town and country, and partly
to an intensive country-wide campaign in
which people are urged to put their houses
in order and to spend money in such a way as
to bring about a revival of the building trade.
The plan in the United States is still in the
experimental stage. We are only beginning.
The Government of Canada is guaranteeing
to the extent of 15 per cent the money loaned
by the banks. It may lose some money, but
inasmuch as it will lessen the number of
people on the dole, surely the experiment is
worth while.
My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. MeMeans) asks what this will cost. The whole
scheme is to be carried on by committees of
public-spirited men throughout the Iand who
are disposed to do something for the State;
so this phase of it will cost nothing. What
will be the cost of the administration of the
Act by the Department of Finance? The
Deputy Minister of Finance, who appeared
before the committee, said all he would need
would be perhaps two or three more clerks
for the two or three years the scheme will be
in existence. That is my justification for
saying it will cost practically nothing.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, the honourable the senior member from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. McMeans) has raised
objection to this Bill on the ground that
the Government is going to lend a great deal
of money and that much of it will be lost.
I wish the first part of his statement were true.
I am afraid the Government will lend very
little money.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. HAIG: It wiil guarantee 15 per
cent of what the banks lend. But the banks
wili lend very littie money. The scbeme has
been in operation now for about six montbs,
and wbat do we find in the city of Winnipeg?
We find that anybody who bas the right kind
of security can go to the bank and borrow
money without any guarantee from the Government, but that witbout sucb security nobody can get money, Government guaranter,
or no, What is going to happen is this.
Witbin six months or iess there will be an
agitation for the Government to lend the
moncy direetly. When I. for instance, because
I can produce security and show that my
property is clear, can go to, the bank and
get money and my next-door neigbbour cannot do so, because bis property is not clear
and bis taxes are in arrears, bis wif e will
say to bim, " Wby cannot we bave our boeuse
improved just as well as the Haigs?" The
result will be that the Government wili lac
forced into lending money directly. Then
look out!I Then the senior senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. MeMeans) will be right.' We
in Manitoba to date hav e had more experience
in government iending than any other province, in proportion to our population. We
lent $10,000,000 in farm boans; we iost baif of
it. We lent $3.000.000 on rural credits and
iost it ail. Not oniy did we lose it ail, but
we lost a great deal more in trying t0 colecet
the original sum. You wili have the came
experience bere. Already in Winnipeg there
xc a growing agitation by people who want to
know why, whcn the Government is guaranteeing the loans and hanks are( running no
risk, one man shouId be able to go to a
bank and borrow money for home improvement and another man not be able to do the
same tbing.
I am opposed to this Bill. It is oniy
camouflage and is mi..leading the people of
the countrv. Unles the Government is prepared t0 get behind it anti lend the money
tiireýtl.v- antI that wiil mean giving it-the
Bill will do no good at ail.

Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: The honourable the senior senator fromn Winnipeg (Hon.

a letter telling me of the staff of this commission, and their salýaries. The information

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Does it give

temporary? The letter gives information that
seemed to be authentic, but I cannot believe
it, because I have such confidence in the
chnirman.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I read the
answer, but perbaps I saw it in the papiers
rather than in Hansard. The name of the
chairman was there, and the amount rereived
by him was nil.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN:

question on the Order Paper and get -in
answer.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I ean state
MY question now. and it will appear on Hansard; so there is no need to put it on the
Order Palier. What 1 should like is a list of

Righit Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: And a list
of the various coînmittees with the remuneration of aIl their members. This letter I received toid about the Youth Committee. which
always was a source of amusement to me.
A speciai committee xvas appointed, as if the
problem of finding employment for youth
were any different fromn that of finling cmployment for others. On that committee there

That is an-

Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: Perhaps. But
the salaries as stated to me were not vouthfui; they were rather mature. There is said
to be a whole string of persons on that committee too. Then, I am toid, there is an

$625 a month, and an adviser on something

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: 1 know it will

Hon. Mr. DUFF: Well. I earned that titie
by hard work and service to my country.
.In the first place, honourable senators, I do
not believe this hegislation wilh do very much
good. In the second place, I arn afraid it is
just another bit of that kind of legislation
wbich tends to inculcate in the minds of the
people the idea that wbenever anyone gets
into difficulty-wbetber it is a case of a man
baving a fight with bis wif e in the morning
or something more serious-be can turn to
the Government and have bis affairs straigbtened out. I say, honourable senators, we
must get away from legislation like this, for
making loans in connection wîth farrns, home
improvement plans and everytbing else. I
should like to see every house in the country
beautifuhly painted, with a new roof, a bathroom, a hot air or hot water furnace-perhaps the hot air kind would be better-and
witb ail modern improvements. But I tbink
you will agree witb me that after alI is said
and done the only way a man can bave theso
improvements made to bis home and at tbiè
same time bold up bis bead in pride is by
paying for tbem with money that he earns
himself.
Honourable members wilh recaîl from their
reading of the Bible that a certain Person
was taken up to a higb pinnacle and shown
the whole world, and tohd He could have it

hegishation of this kind our Parliament and
legishatures are pointing out certain things to
the people and trying f0 tempt themn. One
danger I see is this, that people who cannot
afford to do so wilh go to the banks to borrow
money, perbaps $500 or $1,000 or $2,000, and
agree to pay six and two-thirds per cent
interest on it, and if the banks lend it-

Hon. WILLIAM DUFF: Honourable senators, before this Bill is read a third time I
should like to say a few words. When I
noticed the measure was introduced in another Chamber I wondered as to what attitude I should take on it. In the hast year or
two s0 much of a certain new type of hegisiation was introduced in the Parliament and
legisiatures of this country that I began to
think I was perhaps losing my grasp on social
and financial matters, and I wondered whether
I was getting to be old-fashioncd. Now, I
agree witb what bas been said by the honourable the senior senator from Winnipeg (Hon.
Mr. McMeans). It scems to me that our
Parliament and legislatures are going out of
their way to introduce measures in an attempt
to alleviate conditions of the present time.
Perhaps I reahhy am getting old-fashioned:
it is my opinion that legishation neyer will
bring this coun.try back to where it should be.
We have to adopt the old-fashioned method
of bard work in order to get back to prosperity.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DUEF: And economy as well.
Everybody knows that wben there is a chance
to get goverfiment money easily people are
apt to be only too ready to take advantage
of it. There is nobody in this House or in
this country who is more sympathetic to the
ordinary individual than I arn. I do flot want
to boast of the way I have had to work in
the hast forty-five years, but certainly I can

Hon. Mr. DUFF: I doubt týhat tbey wilh;

I arn afraid the Bill wihl tempt many people
to make expenditures wbich they cannot afford,
and that they will be unable to pay back
their borrowings in three or five years as
provided by the measure. I say we should
flot encourage people to go into debt hike
that. We should flot pass a Bill which says to
the banks, "If you are willing to take a

good legisiation. Yet in reading the newspapers 1 find that sorne of the most intelligent
citizenýs of the country are going around
holding meetings and urging that people make
improvernents to their hiomes under this Bill.
And 1 notice, especiaily in rny own province,
that the men who. are on the committees and
who are particulary interested in getting the
Bill through are hardware merchants; or deaiers
in stoves.. bath tubs, furn:xe nr other îthiîg
that wouid be required in larger quantities
if the measure became iaw.
I repeat. honourable senators, that in my
opinion this legisiation is entirely wrong.
Instead of urg-ing citizens of this country to
stand on their own feet, ta repair bheir homes
on thetr own responsibilities, and te practise
thrift and economy, the measure would in
my opinion resuit in making our people
subservient ta the State and to banks and
other institutions that lend theni money. It
is a palliative, not a remedy; and once the
smail amounts borrowed under this Bill are
spent, the workmen will be again out of
empinyrnent. We want legisiation whieh will
provide permanent employment, not temporary expedients. I therefore desire ta move,
in1 amendment, that this Bill be not now read
the third time, but this day six months.

Nlr.

DUFF.

Then, ynît ask, whv arn I in faveurr of this
measure? WeIL. extraordinary circumstances
jnotify extraordinary rneaýures, if thiey are
wisely thoetght out. We have been through
a black and most onetous depression. which
seoetned to stifie the enterprise of our people
and restîlted in a stagnation of indxtstry
ex'erywhere. The effects, largely psychological,
herame increasingiy cx ident as the depression
proeeeded in its cotutse.A we ail know,
our big capital industrie-s ttsed to crnploy a
latrge proportion of the men who are stili
idle, and it is these industries that we have 10
get going again. Ernplloyees of what we cal1
industries of immediate production-the production or manufacture of fond and so forthwere at the
ct-y worst of the depression
largely occupicd, and as it lifted sornewhat
there was very littie iincmployment among
that ciass of labour; bnt the unemployment
in our capital industries, construction and so
forth, continued and was very severe.
The United States addressed itself to the
prablem of "priming the purinp" in the construction industry, and effected an improx ement. ItsCnt ernment latinched a programme
of federal construction, with aIl the money
coining
from
the
federal
treasury. We
lannched our programme in a far more
moderate and, in my judgment, far wiser way.
So far as the United States Government bas
proceeded on its course. 1 feeb-if my opinion
ts worth even listening to-that the fountry
is likeiy to land in the mire.
The Government of the United States also
adopted something of the course, wbirh is
refiected in this measure. We are placing
upon those most competent to judge, and witb
something to, los,
the onus of deciding
wbetber an applicant for a loan is wortby of
credit because of his record, his character, hiq
position, and we are saying to them, "Now,
if yon will belp those who, you tbink, are
worthy of credit, we will stand back of your
ultimate loss to the extent of 15 per cent."
The system under this Bill is iikely ta resuit
in the choice of sncb as are wortby of credit,
and therefore in little loss to the Administration. If by that littie loss we cao give a
fillip ta the construction industry of Canada,
it is in my opinion worth wbile, for I believe
it will bring collateral and additianal resuits
ta warrant the expenditure.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Does my rigbt bonourable
friend flot tbink the improvement seheme wihl
be merely temporary? If it were likely to be
permanent I shoud agree witb him.

FEBRUARY 25, 1937

Right Hon. Mr. MEIOHEN: 1 do not
think it should be permanent at ail. If the
scheme does its work it ivill do it in the
course of two years. It will get the construction industry going. The habit will grow
and there will be much more construction than
ever, to the great alleviation of industry. I
know that is the motive of the Chairman of
the National Employment -Commission, having
heard him address the Canadian Club in
Toronto a few weeks ago. I know of no one
better able to work out the proposed plan,
though I do not sec why the Governiment
itself shoul not have undertaken it. I like
the plan. The honourable the junior member
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) is quite
correct in saying there will not be a great
demand on the treasury. That is ail to the
good. To my mind the scheme does offer a
sane hope that it will start going the wheels
of our construction industry, and, if it does,
we are going to have a more rapid absorption
of that cîass of labour which otherwise was
likely to wait a considerable time for emplnyment.

Parliament of Canada and other parliaments
having gone altogether ton far in reversing
the old adage that the Lord helps those who
help themseives. We have in the past gone
too far in undertaking to help those who.
so far as we can see, have shown o reasonable disposition to help themselves.
I have to the best of my abiiity analysed
this Bill, and I do not regard it as a measure
which contemplates the spending of large
sums of the people's money for certain construction work to. be donc in various parts of
Canada. As I understand the Bill, the Govcroment undertakes to co-.operate with the
hanks :and other financial institutions of
Canada which are willing týo ]end money for
the purpose of building construction and remodeliing of houses. and, as one honourabie
senator put it, repainting and installing new
piumbing, and doing various other repairs that
may he very nccessary in anme Canadian
homes. This Bill gives the banks an opportunity Vo iend money to certain reliable persons. I happen to know of one Canadian
who-

Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, I undcrstand we are speaking to

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No; the amendment.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Ras the amendment

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is not

The Hon. the SPEAKER: The motion
before the Senate is for the third reading of
the Bill, as amended.

Then there is

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That is what I
wantcd to clear up hefore I made a few
rcmarks. The motion before the House is
fur the~ third reading of this Bill as amended.
1 am in full accord with certain of the
statements of honourable .senators as to the

the

honourable

Hon. Mr. MURD-OCK: Yes.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Could the banks not lend
money to reliable persons without this Bill?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: 0f course they
could; but I .iudge that under conditions which
have prevailed in this country for the past
few years the banka feel that the Government
shnuld say: "Amen. We are with you and we
wili hack you up to the extent of 15 per
cent, if that should be necessary."
This
measure does ot contemplate lending money
to Tom, Dick and Harry. No person cao
geV money under the provisions of this Bill,
as I understand it, uniess he can show to a
bank or other financiai institution that he
has a steady job at regular pay, and agrees Vo
set aside out of his carninga a certain amount
per week, per month or per year in repayment of his boan.
I was going to say a moment ago that I
happen to koow of one gond Canadian-his
name is familiar Vo every honourabie senator
within the sound of my voice-who couid
flot get a boan under this Bili. Why? Because, uofortunately, he has no job and caonoV say, "NexV month or next year I wiii
repay you nut of my caroinga s0 much per
wcek. per month or per year."
I canot understand snme of the objections
made by my honourabie friend the senior
member fromn Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. MeMeans).
As I see it, the purpose of the Bill is to

SENATE
encourage financial institutions to beip recrecate
or iîiiîrove the homes of Canadians in our
variou- fow n's and cities, and under the ccum-dtanecs it secrns to nme the very leasf we
can dIo is to co-opcrate to the extent of 15
per cent. If, as some honourable genîtlemian
lias sid. nothing is going to be done uinder
tbis Bill, thien thiere is flot verY rnuch to
worry about. Presumably the hanks xvili be
just as zealous as tisual in looking aftcr their
interests, and just as carefuil to s.ce that t.hev
inake loans oniv to tho.e whio are iikelv to
rcpa 'v.
I do not think ive can co-operate wjth the
construction and building industrv anil xxifl
the thousands of Canadians xvhose homes bave
been alloxved to mun down during the past
few x'ears, unless we pass tbis measure . Tlhen
we ;hall have an opporfîinif.y te 50e bow if
works ont. It may be that next year some
of the prophecies cf honourabie gentlemen
will hc, borne out, and it xviii be demonstrated
tbat xvc have made anotber mistake; but in
that event it wili flot be as expensive a
mistake as some of the others that bave been
mentioned tliis afternoon.
Rigbt HON. GEORGE P. GRAHAM:
Honourable senators, I think il is essential
tliat xxe kcep in mind wliat is really the
objeet of tlîis Bill.
Sonie Hon. SENATOIIS: Hear, biear.
Rigbit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Its prirnary
purpose is not tlie repair of bîouses; it is to
gix'e crnployrnent at fliat work. It may be a
harsb qtaternent. but to one wbo lives near
tbe bigbway, and tbe members of whose
farnilv spend haif tbeir time ansxvering the
doorbeli to applicants foir food or work, it
would seern that we are assisting in developing
a citizenslîip, flot of workers, but of loafers.
Riglit Hon. Mi. MEIGIIEN: Hear, hear.
Rigbit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: 1 took occasion
recentlv to find out during a week at my own
borne hoxv many persons; of tliose wbo called
sedfoi, enîpiovrent. Only one out of
sixteen applicants made sucli a request, and
lie did s0 at nigbt, when lie knew lie was flot
likelr to be given anything f0 do. The sad
part of the trouble is tbat young men wbo
get on relief, through their farnilies, seema to
be arrix ing at the opinion that the world
owes tùhenx a living and they can get it without working-. Tbat is not developing tlîeir
m anbood.
If thîis Bill assists in gix ing employrnent f0
men wlîo are williîîg to take it, it will to that
extent stop the avalanche of boys and men
towards tlic idie iife. It is beart-rending to
have tîvo or hîree boys corne f0 thle door,
Hon. Nlr. MURDOCK.

vhîo, t hîir plarenits beting out of xvork, have
unilertaken f0 get a living fbrougli absolute
every daY begging. Municipalities pass bylaws
declaring it iliegal for beggars to go frorn
dooi' f0 door. Sucb bYlaxs may act as a
deri'rent once ina a wx'ile, but the trek continues frona bouse to biouse. In Brockx'ilic
miv bouse is net nieglected. and wlien I corne
to the city cf Ottawva 1 find it bias been
discovered that this is net a bad place to
land in whien one is iooking for sorne hlîep.
The object of this Bill is to get rnen te go
back te work, te, refurn f0 a life of real
citizenship instead of (lepending on their
neighhours. I wouid matiier give $100 te belp
a mnan get a job than gix'e $10 te keep lîim in

shouid be at work. 1 dIo net thîink we are

I arn
strongiy in favour cf anything that wiii. in a
measonable way, encourage rnen te go back

Hon. THOMAS CANTLEY: ilonourtîble

garage eperators.

Hon.' ANTOINE J. LEGER: May I eaul
attention fo section 10 cf flic Bill? If says:
Any person înaking a 8tatemnent in an application for a home inîproveinent boan -%Nhltch
is faiseYou xviii notice tbat the word, used is
"faise," not 'frauduient."
Under this section
a man wih night be acting in tbe best of
faitb couid, andÎ in ail probability would, be
found guilty. As the section rends, there is
no chance for a seienfer or a mens rea. If
the staternent is false, lie is guilty. I wouid
suggest that flic section be made te read:
-whicî is kiîoxn by hîim te be false.
In that xvay the provision wouid be in accordance xvith neariy ail, if not ali, cf our legislation deaiing xxith punitive measures.
Hon. Mr. DANDURA'ND: I shouid net be
disposed f0 accept s-ticii an arnendment. The
claus.e as if stands is very clear.
Any peî s<m niaking a statenient in an application for a hione irîîproxveniLiit boan whichi is
folse iin aîiy omnterial respect-

FEBRUARY 25, 1937
and s0 onl, shall be hiable. Wben he makes
bis deýclaration or statement he knows what
be is talking about.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: He ought to, anyway.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: He knows what
he is obligating himself to, and I would hold
him responsible for bis statement, from. wbich
he will obtain profit. Be may be called before
the courts if be makes a false statement "in
any material respect," or "uses the proceeds
of a home improvement loan otberwise than
in payment for repairs, alterations or additions to the rural or urban home of which
he is the owner specified, in bis application."
I do flot see that we need to add to that. We
are satisfied that ha should know the statement be makes te be true.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Surely we are
to understand that he coull flot get a loan
at ail unless he said it was for the purpose of improving bis home in some way.
Surely that is what is meant. If later he
utilizes that money for something else-for
garage or automobile expenses, as suggested
by the bonourable senator fromn New Glasgow (Hon. Mr. Cantley)-his statement is
untrue. That, it seems to me, is why the
word "false" is used. He could not get the
boan unless it was for some home improvement; and if he uses the money for some other
pîirpose his statement is false.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: We have net seen the
application that wilýl be used in connection
with sucb boans, but I have no douht that one
of the inquiries among the many will be,
"Are you the owner of the ]and in question?"
During my practice as a lawyer 1 have known
a man to build a bouse on a lot which did flot
belong to him. In fact, it was only after
many years that ha discovered ha had buîlt
on a lot which belonged te somehody aIse. In
such a case as that a man could be found
guilty undar this section. I cite this extreme
example te show that many othar cases could
arise in which a -man acting in good faith
migbt be held guilty under the Act. A man
may believe that ail the statements he
makes are true, yýet it may be discovered
afterwards that some of them, through ne
fault of bis own, are quite incorrect. In such
a case ha would ha guilty. That is why I
ohject to the section. I do net intend te
dehate the point at ail. I simply raise the
question and leave it te the Senate to decide.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it your
pleasure, honourable members, that the Bihl
now pass?

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: May I take
occasion te refer again to the personnel of the
commission and its staff? The honýourable
senator from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Black)
bas drawn my attention te Hansard- cf the

2. Wbat salaries were paid during 1936?
3. What is tbe rate for eaeli member per

4. What bas been the total amount spent on,

Honourable members will see that the first

FREE FOREIGN TRADE ZONES BILL
SITTINGS OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. BLACK: Before the Orders of
the Day are called I should like to make a
brief announcement.
At the last meeting
of the Committee on Banking and Commerce
it was decided to meet again at 10.30 on Tuesday morning to .consider the Free Foreign
Trade Zones Bill. Since then, however, representations have been made by those who desire to give evidence, stating that they cannot
be here on that date. So the committee
will not resume its labours on this Bill until
10.15 on Wednesday morning. I may say
further that it will not be worth the while of
witnesses from outside to be present at that
time, as the committee has already undertaken
to consider viarious other bills at 10.30. The
committee will meet. therefore, on the Free
Foreign Trade Zones Bill at 10.15 on Wednesday. when it will probably postpone further
consideration.

FREIGHT TARIFF RATES
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. SUTHERLAND inquired of the
Government:
1. How many special, and how mîany competitive, freight tariff rates have been allowed

or approved by the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada during each of the years
ending December 31, 1935 and 1936?

105

MARCH 2,1937
2. What was the extent in dollars of the
reduction from the standard rate set by the
Board termed special and also termed coupetitive?
3. What is the approximate railway mileage
at present being operated under each classification of freight rate tariffs, namely, standard,
special, and competitive?
4. What constitutes competitive points, as
interpreted by the Board?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
gentleman's inquiry was submitted to the
Board of Railway Commissioners by the Department of Transport, and I have here a
copy of the reply sent by the Board. I think
the honourable senator did not realize the
amount of work that would be entailed in
answering his inquiry, and it may be that the
reply is somewhat different from what he
expected. Addressed to George W. Yates,
Esq., Assistant Deputy Minister and Secretary, Department of Transport, it begins by
quoting the inquiry in full, and then goes on:
I am directed to advise you that it is impossible for the Board's Traffic Department,
with its present staff, to answer this inquiry.
Upon carefully considering the inquiry, as
worded, it is estimated that it would take the
full time of the entire staff of the Traffie
Department for at least six months to take out
the information asked for.
The answer to question 1 would, probably,
involve an examination of several million
different rates filed during 1935 and 1936. If
the information were taken out, it would be
immediately out of date, because many rates
are being changed every working day of the
year. Special, or competitive, tariffs filed with
the Board contain anywhere from a few to
many hundreds of rates and, during the month
of January, 1937, two railways alone filed one
hundred and sixty such tariffs with the Board.
In question 1, reference is made to special
and competitive tariffs "allowed or approved"
by the Board. Special and competitive freight
tariffs do not require formal approval or allowance by the Board. Sec sections 328 to 331
of the Railway Act.
So far as relates to question 2, if this covers
the traffie actually earried by the railways
during the years 1935 and 1936, the information
is not available in the Board's records. The
bulk of the freight traffic of Canada, approximately 95 per cent of it, does not pay, and
never bas paid, the rates shown in standard
freight tariffs.
With respect to question 4, competitive points
are points as to which two or more transportation lines compete for the movement of traffie.
Yours truly,
P. F. Bail-largeon,
Secretary, B.R.C.
I would suggest to my honourable friend
that he confer with the Secretary of the De-

partment, Mr. Yates, to see whether some of
the information he seeks cannot be easily
obtained in another form.

COMMISSION
ANSWER TO INQUIRY
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should like

Improvement Loans Guarantee Bill?
Yes. The inHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
quiry is as follows:
1. What is the personnel of the National
Employment Commission?
2. What salaries were paid during 1936?
3. What is the rate for each member per

4. What has been the total amount spent
on, for or by this body?
My right honourable friend will tell me
whether these questions cover his inquiry.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
The answers
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
are as follows:
1. Answered by attached statement "A."
2. See statement "A."
3. See statement "A."
I produce statement "A," but as it is a
lengthy document I will not read it. It will
appear in Hansard.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
it is lengthy.

I am sorry

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The statement
is lengthy, but perhaps my right honourable
friend will find that it discloses the commission is not as costly as be thought it
might be.
As to the fourth question, further information is being secured in order that it
may be adequately answered. The information will cover the total amount spent to
January 31, 1937, including the cost of national
registration of the unemployed on relief.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Will the honourable

GOVERNMENT HARBOURS AND PilERS
BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
bhird reading of Bill 9, an Act to amend the
Government Harbours and Piers Act.
My right honourable fiiend
He said:
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) suggested last
T-huirsday that the motion for third reading be
postponed until to-day because the honourable
senator from Aima (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne)
desired to speak to the Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. He is
not here; so I wjll offer no further objection
to the motion.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.
BRITISH COLUMBIA DIVORCE
APPEALS BIILL
SECOND READING

Hon. R. F. GREEN moved the second reading of Bill 15, an Act to provide for Appeal
to the Court of Appeal of the Province of
British Columbia in Divorce and Matrimonial
Causes.
He said: Honourable senators, I am not
conversant with the legal considerations involved,' and therefore I will ask the seconder
of the motion, my honourable friend from
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. Farris), to exiplain the
Bill.
Hon. J. W. de B. FARRIS: Hon-ourable
senators, this Bill is applicable only to British
Columbia. As a practising lawyer, I know
something about the need for At. lIts purpose
is to give jurisdiction in divorce cases to ithe
Court of Appeal in British Columbia. We
have there a Supreme Court which is the trial
court. Ever since Confederation the Supreme
Court has had jurisdiction to hear and determine divorce actions; but the only appeal
from the decision of the trial judge is to the
Privy Council. The resul', as lhonourable
senators can well understand, is that there are
practically no appeals.
The Bill dees net in any way purport to
give added jurisdiction te the trial court, lit
enactmnent will, i believe, tend to diminish
rather tiban te increase divorces. Speaking
net authoritatively, but only from observation,
I should think that in eonsiderably over 90
per cent of the divorce cases heard in British
Columbia decrees are granted. It is true that
many are ex parte cases, but, noîtwithstanding,
one can readily see that, almost of necessity,
the mai ority of appeals will be from judgments in which divorces have been granted.

109

I need net point eut te honourable members
how extremely important it is that justice
should be administered with the same oare in
divorce as in any other form of action; in
fact I know of none in which justice is more
essential. A.nd the basis of appeal is reconsideration to ensure that justice shahl be done.
I have seme figures which. I obtained yesterday and whidh, te me, are rather startling.
In 1935 there were 384 divorces granted in
British Columbia; in Ontario, 463. On the
basis of 100,000 of population, 54 divorces were
granted in British Columbia, 28 in Saskatchewan, which was the next highest, and 14 in
Ontario.
I would point eut that a few years ago Parliament passed a law granting te, the Ontario
courts jurisdiction in divorce. Under that legislation there is the right cf appeal from the trial
judge. British Columbia is the only province
exercising jurisdliction in divorce in which there
is no such ýappeal. A strikîng comment on th-is
lack of appeal is that the percentage of
divorces in the province is very nroch bigher
than in any of the other provinces in which
the courts have jurisdiction in divorce and
matrimonial causes.
I may add, honourable senators, lihat in
another place the Hon. Minister of Justice,
hav.ing examined this Bill, expressed the
opinion that its, enactment would tend te
diminish rather than te increa.se divorce in
the province.
I may state further that the Benchers of the
Law Society of British Columbia have unamimnously recommended to Parliament that this
proposed legislation be passed. I trust honourable senators will sec their way clear te
give te British Columbia the saine right cf
appeal in divorce and matrimonial causes as is
,enjoyed by the other provinces which exercise
jurisdiction in such cases.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: Would it net be
ultra vires of this Parliament te pass this
measure? Is net jurisdiction vested in the
provincial Legisiature? In my province the
legisiature may limait the right of appeal.
Hou. Mr. FARRIS: The consensus cf legal
opinion is that jirrisdiction is vested in the
Dominion Parliament. But I discussed the
matter with the Attorney-General of British
Columbia, and he told me that, for greater
assurance and se, there may be ne complications afterwards, if this Bill is enacted he wil
intreduce a similar bill in the Legishature.
Hon.

Right

Mr. McMEANS: Is net the law cf
in British Columbia based on the old
law of 1858?
Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: 0f 1857.

110

SENATE

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Parliament has amended
the law, enlarging the grounds on which
women may obtain divorce.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Since British Columbia came into Confederation it has had no
right to enact divorce legislation. Its jurisdiction in divorce is based on the Imperial
statute of 1858.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Yes.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I do not quite understand why the province needs this measure.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: The Appellate Court of
British Columbia and the Supreme Court of
Canada have decided that in divorce cases
there is no appeal to the provincial Court of
Appeal.
Right
Hon.
ARTHUR
MEIGHEN:
Honourable senators, I am in favour of the
measure; in ffact I cannot help wondering that
some such measure has not been introduced
before. I hope I shall not be taken as presuming to understand the law better than the
honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. Farris), for I am confident 1e knows it
better than I do; but I shall try to give my
appreciation of it, and I hope that if I am not
correct he will add to my statement along still
sounder lines.
I shall deal mainly with the suggestion that
there is to be concurrent legislation passed in
British Columbia.
If I have the historical
picture at all right in my mind, there is not
the faintest reason for such legislation. In
England, until 1857, as I understand the position, there wais release from marriage a mensa
et toro-from bed and board, as we term it
here; but there was no release from the
bond of marriage itself a vinculo matrimonii,
enabling the releasee to marry again. In 1857
the Imperial Parliament passed the Divorce
and Matrimonial Causes Act, under which a
divorce, giving entire release, with the right to
narry again, could be obtained throughout the
entire jurisdiction to which that Act applied.
Among the courts having jurisdiction in divorce
and matrimonial causes was the Supreme Court
of the then colony of British Columbia.
Under Confederation divorce is a matter of
federal jurisdiction. We are exercising this
jurisdiction all the time. The solemnization
of marriage is under provincial jurisdiction,
but marriage itself and divorce are subject to
the federal authority. It is also a term of the
British North America Act that the law of
England applies in matters where there is
federal jurisdiction, except as it may be modified by such jurisdiction.
Inasmuch as
the Parliament of Canada has not enacted
legislation modifying the law of divorce, at
Hon. Mr. FARRIS.

all events to the extent of cancelling it, the
jurisdiction residing in these provincial courts
prior to Confederation still subsists; therefore
it still subsists in the Supreme Court of
British Columbia.
Now, I ask honourable senators to keep in
mind that jurisdiction in marriage and divorce
is federal.
Prior to Confederation Britisb
Columbia had no court of apeal, but with
the development of the province an appellate
court was established with power to hear
appeals in all cases. An appeal in a divorce
case was taken before tbat court.
The
appellate judges held that as the power to
hear appeals came from the provincial Lrogislature, it could not be taken to include
appeals from judgments in divorce cases,
because the provincial Legislature had no
power to vest the court with such jurisdiction, and therefore that the only appeal was
ta the Privy Council, where it had subsisted
right up to the houe of Conffederation. It
certainly is a most unhappy state of affairs
that that should be the only appeal, because it
really amounts to an appeal solely for the
rich.
The very point which was decidel by the
Appeal Court of British Colurnhia went
also, if my reading is correct, to the Suprene
Court of Canada, and that court ipheld the
Court of Appeal of British Columbia. the
effect of the decision being that the Court of
Appeal of British Columbia had not jurisdiction in relation to divorce, for the ieason
given. Well. if it bas not-and to ny mind it
manifestly never had, and could not havewhat is the idea of concurrent legislation in
British Columbia? Certainly no provincial
legislature has jurisdiction in divorce and
marriage. For the purposes of this measure,
however, it is manifest that if British Columbia is to have the right of appeal in divorce
actions, which it ought to have, it cannot
have it until this Bill passes. I am entirely
in support of the measure.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: It has the Act of
1858, but has not the benefit of any amendments made to the English law since then.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
1867.

No; up to

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: We have conferred
on Ontario, as I understand, it, jurisdiction
under the English law as it stood in 1867 or
at a later date; but in British Columbia the
people are still living in the Dark Ages.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Why is this legislation
necessary for British Columbia if it is not
necessary also for Manitoba, Saskatchewan
and Alberta?

MARCH 2,1937
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Was there a
Court of Appeal in Manitoba at the time
of Confederation?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. Manitoba became
a province in 1870, and in Walker v. Walker
it was held by the Privy Council that we had
the law of England as it existed in 1870.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: When was
the Appeal Court of Manitoba established?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: About 1905.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It was called
the Supreme Court then, but there was an
appellate division.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Not prior to 1870. At
the time Manitoba became a province there
was nothing but a Supreme Court.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I will not
contradict my honourable friend, but I think
there was.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: There must have been,
I judge, in the old Northwest Territories.
We had one court for a period of years, but
there was an appeal.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I was going to ask my
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Farris) if in
British Columbia they did not have an appeal
to a court en banque, as we had in Manitoba. I think I am right in saying that we
had exactly the same law in Manitoba as
they had in British Columbia.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: What difference would
it make, as long as the law provided for an
appeal, even if some of the judges sat on the
original case? There was an Appeal Court
just the same.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: There was no provision
for appeal in divorce in Manitoba, because
until about 1908, as I understand it, we had
no right to grant divorce.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is truc;
but there was a right of appeal to a court
constituted by legislation, though it may
have been a part of the Supreme Court. If
that was the case before 1870, the powers the
courts then had would subsist up to the
present time.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: In British Columbia was
there not an appeal before 1870 or 1871, to a
part of the Supreme Court?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: That, it seems to me,
is rather immaterial. In the case of Claman
v. Claman, LXVIII Supreme Court Reports,
page 4, it was decided that the Court of Appeal
of British Columbia had no jurisdiction; Sa

111

if the position is the same in Manitoba, I
would suggest to my honourable friend that
the decision of the court in Manitoba is
wrong. because the decision I have cited is
that of the Supreme Court of Canada.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If this law should apply
to the Prairie Provinces there is no reason
why we should pass it in relation to British
Columbia only, and deal later with measures
for Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: May I read
from the statement of the sponsor of the Bill
in another place?
In the three Prairie Provinces Privy Council
decisions have established that the English
divorce law of July 15, 1870, is in force, and

decisions of the provincial appeal courts within
the last few years have established their own
right to hear appeals.
These are the remarks of the sponsor of the
Bill, not my own. He says it is established
that the right did rest in the Court of Appeal
at the time of the law of July 15, 1870.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The question of the
right to grant divorce went to the Privy
Council in Walker and Walker, but I doubt
if there has ever been an appeal from our
court on the right to hear divorce appeals.
However, I do not object to the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

NAVAL AFFAIRS
CORRECTION OF ANSWER TO INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senators, on Wednesday, the 24th of February,
I gave a series of answers te an inquiry by
the honourable gentleman from Alma (Hon.
Mr. Ballantyne). I have now received from
the Department of National Defence a cor-

MARCH 3, 1937
rection of the answer that was given to the
8th question in that inquiry. That question
read:
If the Aurora was sold or scrapped, to whom,
and what price was pa-id?
The following answer should be substituted
for the answer previously given:
The Aurora was sold at the request of the
Government of the United Kingdom. Tenders
for the sale were invited through the press
by the Government salvage officer, and six
firms offered quotations. The highest bid
($40,400) was received from A. A. Larocque,
Sorel, P.Q., to whom the ship was sold to be
broken up. The proceeds of the sale were
handed over to the Government of the United
Kingdom.
DISCUSSION

Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE rose in accordance with the following notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate
to the training of naval cadets and the closing
of the Naval College and also to the sale of
the training ship Aurora.
He said: Honourable senators, in rising to
speak with regard to certain naval matters
I desire to make it quite plain at once that I
am not opposed to the increase for the defence
of Canada, to the extent of some $14,000,000,
that was voted recently and passed in another
place. I consider that was a step in the right
direction.
I desire also to thank the honourable leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
for the prompt replies he was good enough
to give me to my inquiry. I have noted the
correction he has just presented to the House
in regard to the sale of the Aurora. Later
on in my remarks I shall make more detailed
reference to the sale of that ship.
One of my reasons, honourable senators, for
bringing before this Chamber the question of
naval defence, in its broadest sense, is that it
seemed to me this was not given the important
consideration it ought to have received during
the recent debates on national defence in another place.
The total expenditure of
$34,089,888 for the defence of Canada is to
be distributed as follows: Militia defence,
$17,850,428; Naval defence, the comparatively
small amount of $4,486,810; Air defence,
811,752,650.
Another reason for my speaking on this
question to-day is the experience that my right
honourable leader (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
and myself had as members of the Union
Government during the last year of the War,
1918. Later on I shall refer also to that experience more in detail. I cannot agree
altoget-her with the opinions expressed by

113

those occupying public positions in this country. Great stress was laid upon the fact that
this vote was intended solely to meet possible
internal trouble and for home defence. Again
and again the Right Hon. Prime Minister and
the Hon. Minister of National Defence were
asked if Canada was in any way committed
in regard to defence outside her own borders
They promptly replied, "Not to the extent of
one dollar." I for one do not anticipate any
internal trouble, but I am impressed by the
rapid change that has occurred in the political
atmosphere this session as compared with the

preceding year. Last session brotherly love,
peace and goodwill prevailed to such an extent that clause 98 of the Criminal 'Code was
repealed. That clause had been incorporated
in the Code, and very properly so, to control
Communistie activities which were considered
to be contrary to peace, order and good government. To-day those who are etressing the
possibility of internal trouble are surrounded
by Communists as were the gallant 600 by
Russians, for apparently they see Communists
in front of them, Communists behind them,
Communists to their left and Communists to
their right. "Therefore," they say, "we are
justified in voting for this increase in our
defence estimates. We are fearful of internal
troubles, and our first duty is to protect our
homes, our families, and our institutions."
Hon. Mr. 'CASGRAIN: Look at the recent
trouble in the city of Quebec.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: All I can say
to my dear friend is that if any internal
troubles occur in this country our provincial
and city police and our militia forces are perfectly capable of preserving order. We do not
need to mechanize the militia, nor do we need
a fleet of bombing planes to take care of
any domestic trouble that might arise. Those
who express such concern for the preservation
of domestic order have overlooked the vulnerable points-our sea coasts and sea routes.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
I have no
objection whatsoever to the mechanization of
our militia, and I am wholly in favour of increasing our Air Force; but I say the Government has erred in not paying the attention
that it should to the Canadian Navy, and not
providing ships of a type capable of really protecting our coasts and our sea-borne commerce against enemy attacks.
Before I bring to the attention of this honourable Chamber the unfortunate and disheartening record of our Naval Service over

a period of twenty-five years, T desire to refer
to the stand of the Imperial Government and

21117-8

SENATE

Admiralty. They have always regarded the
creation of overseas dominion naval units as
perfectly useless and involving unnecessary
expense. Only a few days ago the Civil Lord,
Sir Samuel Hoare, speaking at Bradford, expressed the opinion that overseas dominion
naval units were very inefficient and costly,
and that the ends of economy and the safety
of the Empire would be better served by one
Inperial navy.
The self-governing dominions, including
Canada, held a contrary view. In 1910, when
the Laurier Government was in power, legislation was passed and placed upon the Statute
Book creating the Canadian Naval Service.
The Government opened a naval collegevery wisely indeed, I think--and also purchased from the Imperial authorities two
fairly large cruisers, the Niobe and the Rainbow, which had been in existence for some
time. The Niobe was placed in commission
on the Atlantic coast, at Halifax, and the
Rainbow on the Pacifie coast, at Vancouver.
These two ships performed a necessary service
on the two oceans while they were in commission. Around 1916 and 1917, when the
submarine menace became very dangerous,
the British Government decided to arm
merchant vessels, and we received instructions
to dismantle the Niobe and the Rainbow, as
their guns were required to be placed on
merchant ships. Accordingly, the Niobe and
the Rainbow were dismantled and became
merely depot ships, one stationed at Halifax
and the other at Esquimalt.
Now we come to the end of the year 1911,
when the Laurier Government was defeated
and the Borden Government came into power.
In 1912, Sir Robert Borden, the then Prime
Minister, attended the Imperial Conference.
After he had been informed of the serious
possibility of war in the very near future he
returned to Canada and, as members of this
Chamber very well know, brought before
Parliament an emergency Bill to present to the
British Government three dreadnoughts, at a

senator from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr.
Graham) and the right honourable senator to
my right (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) will recall that after a stormy debate that continued
both night and day for a fortnight the Bill
finally passed the House of Commons. It
was later defeated by the Senate. I am very
proud of the work of the Senate, but perhaps
honourable members will permit me to say
that at that time, in my opinion, it made a
mistake. However, that settled the three
dreadnoughts.
After that came the Great War, and we
did not have a single cruiser or destroyer.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

Thanks to the wonderful Intelligence Service
of the Admiralty keeping our Government
here constantly advised, we knew that German
submarines were shortly to come across the
Atlantic. Honourable senators will pardon me
for referring again to a matter about whieh I
spoke once before, but it fits very well into
this debate and I think I should refer to it
again. A cablegram came from the Admiralty
reading:
Equip at once with kite balloons. seaplanes
and flying men, stations at Dartmiiouth and
North Sydney.
As we did not have any seaplanes or kite
balloons or the necessary personnel, at the
request of the Government I sent a cable to
the Admiralty asking them to provide these
things and stating that we would proviie the
ground works. Promptly a reply came back
stating that they could do nothing. By this
time or shortly afterwards the German submarines arrived. They sank a 7,000-ton ship
just outside the entrance to Halifax harbourfortunately with no loss of life; they fired on
our fishing boats, and they disturbed our people
and our shipping in every way possible. After
consultation with the Prime Minister and my
colleagues in the Government I was instructed
to send the Deputy Minister of Naval Affairs
to Washington in order to place the situation
before the authorities there, the United States
then being one of our allies, and they sent one
of their cruisers to protect our coast. and 200
splendid flying men, as well as seaplanes and
kite balloons. We provided the ground works.
I cite this merely to show the defenceless
position Canada was in with respect to attack
from the sea.
Now, should England ever become involved in another war-as we all hope she
will not-and find herself unable to corne to
our aid, as she was unable to do in 1918. all
I can say is that I shall be very sorry indeed
for Canada if she is attacked from the sea.
True, we have four destroyers, but they are
somewhat old. The longest range gtn they
have is 4-7. We have some mine-scweepers
also, but we have no submarines, and a
modern battleship could stand off seven miles
and blow our four destroyers to pieces in
from five to ten minutes. A battle cruiser
or a light cruiser could do the same thing
from a shorter range. I think it is quite
plain that if the Mother Country should
become involved in another world war we
shall be in a very precarious position; therefore I feel justified in bringing this matter
before the Chamber.
It lias always appeared to me that not
enough attention has been paid to our naval
affairs. As I have already said, the Laurier
Government notified the British Govemment

MARCH 3, 1937
in 1910 Ihat Canada would protect hier own
sea coasts. I remember very weIl reading in
the press at that time about a ceremony
which took place at Esquimait, and at which
the Deputy Minister, Mr. Desbarats, was
present. The white ensign wa.s lowered for
the first time since Canada hecame a British
possession, the merchant marine flag, with
the Dominion coat of arms emblazoned thereon, was raised, and Canada said 10 the Mot-her
Country, "It is our job now to defend our
own coasts."
la 1926, when the Stalut-e of Westminster
wa8 passed, Canada went stili further. I
for one, perhaps hecause of my ignorance,
have neyer been tremendously impressed with
that statute, but 1 notice it contains the statement that
-ail the overseas Dominions hereatfter undertake to protect their coast-lines a'nd their sea
routes.
That is a pretty big con-tract for Canada to
underlake wilh four destroyers. With the
four destroyers wc have we arc utterly unable to protect either our coast-lines or our
sea routes; therefore the situation merely
comes down to this, that in the future, as in
the past, England must protect this part of
the Empire.
This brings me to the visit of Lord Jellicoc in 1919, when he spent six weeks here.
He was a very charming and able man. If
honourable senators wiil allow me to digress
f or a moment, I would suggest that for $7.50
they cannot purchase greater value than is
to be found in the biography of Lord Jellicoe
by Admirai Bacon. It contains the details
of the Battie of Jutland, as weii as charts and
maps prepared by the late Admirai himself.
It certainly convinccd me, as I am sure it
would convince honourable memjbers, that
Lord Jellicoe ivas the greatest admirai the
Empire has ever had, and that the Grand
Fleel was handled wilh great akili during the
Batle of Jutland. By reading the story of
that hattie one will learn that il was not a
viclory for the Germans at ail; quite the
contrary. In the morning the Grand Fleet
was ready for action, but there was no German
fleet in sight; therefore the resuit could have
been nolhing but a British victory.
Now let me return t0 what I was saying.
In 1919 Lord Jellicoe made certain recommendations, to the Canadian Government.
He proposed, as a minimum, that Canada
should have. three cruisers, a fiotilia of
destroyers and a flotilla of submarines.
Flotilias vary in size, but I presume that
what hie had in mind was that we shouid have,
in addition to the three cruisers, four
destroyers and four submarines. If we had
3117-8j

establisliment . and our Naval Coilege
were opened again s0 that Canadians could
secure proper naval training, we shouid be
able 10 proteet our sea routes to a certain
extent, -because a cruiser couid convoy ships,
and our destroyers wouid be able to
accompany lhem. a certain distance, weather
permitig They would, aiso be usefui
in driving away enemy submarines. But
that

apparentiy the Government has not seen fit
to adopt these recommendations. Therefore

I am alarmed at our present inadequale naval
defence, and disappoinled that those who are

quaiified 10 speak on the defence of Canada
have iateiy made no reference 10 naval defence.
In 1921 my right honourable friend (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) and I were on board a
ship that was not jusl as seaworthy as we
thought it was, and, probably owing to the
facl that Captain Duif was leading the
Opposition fleet, we went down to defeat and
the King Government came int power. One
of the first things it did was to close the
N aval College, lie up the Aurora aI Halifax,
and dismiss bier officers, ail of whom were
Canadian born with the exception of six
senior officers whom it had been neceasary
to get from England. That cruiser was
launched in 1915, and if bought to-day would
cost $5.,000,000. She had four-inch and sixinch guns, as wellI as anti-aircsaft guns, and
carried torpedoes. Her personnel, inciudingail ratings, totalied something like 318. The.
British Government gave Canada as a gif t
not .only the Aurora, but aiso two very good
destroyers, the Patriot and the Patricia.
Honourable senators have heard me sayand I am proud to say it again-that on my
two visits to England attending Imperial
Conferences, every time I discuased naval
questions with the Sea Lords and the Civil
Lord th-ey were most generous in their praise
of our Canadian naval ofificers; they said that
for efficiency and alerlness they would no1
want anything hetter.
Therefore it is to be very deeply regretted

that ou-r Naval College is closed.

Two of the questions I asked
were:
How many Canadian cadets

as midshipmen,
are promoted.
in my inquiry
had Canada in

the Imperial Navy for training in the years

1919 and 1920?
How many Canadian cadets were recailed
fromn the Imperial Navy in 1920 and 1921 for
service in the Canadian Navy?

SENATE
A clever person in the Naval Branch replied
to each of these questions, "Noe." I thought
the reply was ambiguous; so I telephoned
the (iparttment and drew attention to the
question. I was informed that the explanation
of that reply was that, technically speaking.
there are no "cadets," and that I should have
used the term "ranking officers." The department readily admitted that the reply was
wrong, and it was good enough to send me
the information I asked for.
The answer that was given to another one
of my questions causes me considerable concern. Question No. 6 in the list that I placed
on the Order Paper read:
How many Canadians now in the Imperial
naval colleges, for training?
The answer given was this:
In training colHeges, ineluding training ship
Frobisher, 33.
I telephoned the department and asked, "Are
you referring to the Naval College at Dartmouth?" "Oh, no." "Do you mean any of
the real naval colloges in England which we
so well know?"

" No."

" Well,

what have

you in mind when you refer to training
"Oh, colleges where we have 33
colleges?"
Canadians." As far as I can understand, and
from what little I know of the kind of institutions referred to, they are splendid colleges
which give young lads a good general education along with a certain amount of naval
training. But, as the honourable senator from
De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) knows
even better than I do, in training naval
officers you need more than a good ordinary
education. Cadets are required to pursue a
complicated course in technical subjects, including astronomy, navigation, languages, and
many other difficult matters. Cadets who are
trained in naval colleges and then are sent on
to continue their training in the Navy become
officers with a technical background second
to none. But I doubt very much the value
of sending Canadians to these so-called
"training colleges," which in the reply are not
even called naval colleges.
Therefore I would urge my honourable
friend the leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) to say to his colleagues of the
Council when he sits down with them again,
as it is our intention to continue
' Inasmuch
the Naval Service, it is imperative that the
Naval College should be reopened." I trust
that he will also impress upon his colleagues
this point of view: if unfortunately we are
ever attacked it will not likely be from the
air, for the only nation that could attack us
in that way would be our friends to the south,
and they will not do it.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I do not think
we have very mueh to fear from bombing
planes that would have to travel a long distance. Therefore it boils down to this, that
if any European nations have their eye upon
Canada, our rich country, and send ships of
war to attack us, we shall have to depend
upon the Imperial Navy or else strengthen
our own Canadian Navy as I have outlined.
Very shortly there is going to be an Imperial Conference.
Probably my honourable
friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) will be
attending it; certainly the Prime Minister, the
Minister of Defence and other Ministers will
be there. The question of defence will be on
the agenda and is bound to come up. Canada,
being the senior Dominion in the Empire, is
always called upon to speak first. I can
imagine the Prime Minister saying, in effect:
" Under the Statute of Westminster we are
supposed to defend our coast-lines and our sea
routes, but we are unable to do so. Now, I
want to know, and the Government of Canada
wants to know, whether the Imperial Navy will
protect us in the event that we are ever in
real danger. In 1918 the Imperial Navy was
not able to do so. But we are proud to note
the tremendous appropriation that has been
made by Great Britain for defence, anounting to $7,500,000,000 for the strengthening of
the navy, the army and the air force. We,
as members of the Empire, would sleep easier
in our beds at night if we knew the Imperial
Government was committed to protect us
against any aggressor who might corne along."
We have heard a lot about commitments,
honourable senators.
These commitments,
though, are not on the part of Canada; they
are on the part of the Imperial Government.
And I am urging now that our Government
ask the Imperial Government to commit itself
and assure Canada, as part of the Empire,
that we shall be protected in case a world war
breaks out.
Now, honourable senators. I wanted to refer
to what I consider an astounding statement.
which was made a short time ago in England
by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Right
Hon. Neville Chamberlain. In the course of
his budget speech he said that Great Britain
alone would bear the burden of $7,500,000,000
for defence. added to its already heavy taxation, and that not only had he not asked the
Dominions to contribute anything, but he had
no intention of asking them. Those were
generous and noble words. The response of
our country and of our Government should be,
that if ever the Empire and Canada are in
serious danger we will do our utmost not only
to proteet Canada, but also to render help to
Great Britain, wvhich has always protected us

Some Hon. SE-NATOJIS:

SENATE
Oh, oh.

Hon. M\r. CASGRAIN: I must have spent
a good deal of industrY on its proparation. At
the tinme. I remember. the editor of Le Devoir
said, "He must, have spent nights and nights
before an atlas ýto find ail the coaling stations
that he mientioned."
In the course of that
speech I also gave lists of the namnes of the
French Canadians and of the moneys they
contributed to prosedute the çvar. I asked
my good frioncl. from Ontario to produce their
lists. Thev bad noue to produce. It was we
in Quehec who were defending the Empire.
I thon repeatod a saying of Sir Etienne Pascal
Taché (whose bust mav he seen in the Parliamentary Library) that the last gun fired in
defence of the British Empire would be fired
by a French Canadian. I think it will ho.
But as to providing a navy sufficiently strong
to defend our commerce on the seven seas,
that is flot practicable, and we do flot want it.
M v honourahle friend fromn Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) will remember a statement 1w Sir Robert Homne at a meeting some
years ago of the Interparliansentary Union
in Washington. An Irish delegate-I have
forgotten his name-proposed tîxat if England
were at any time to engage in war the
Dominions sbould not necessarily ho at war

tb'it Germany has net a single acre on God's

Germans wouid huilîl a coaling station on

There the Germans hîiilt a model city te,

I

England bas heen, and stili is, the leading
world power because of her great navy, wbich
ensures her supremacy of the seas. In her
effort te hring about disarmament sho delayed,
for years and yoars, the construction and
replacement of ships in the navy. But the
English-speaking people are vory clever in
financial matters, and in censequence of this
delay, cevering nearly twonty years, the
saving in intorest alone on the expenditure
that would have been made in that time will
now supply the money te build tbe ships that
are needed to-day. Now England bas begun
a rearmament programme on a vast scale,

Now let me say a word about Singapore.
It is tbe greatest naval station the world bas
ever seen. It is on an island of about filteen
miles in length by ten miles in width. The
channel between the island and the mainland
is approximately a mile and a quarter wide.
On that island everything that human ingenuity can devise bas been utilized to create a
fortress of immense strengtb. It bas been
compared witb the Maginot Line of France.
A floating dock bas been constructed capable of taking a ship of over 40,000 tons, and
there is also a graving dock to accommodate
the biggest ships afloat or that may be built
for rnany years te corne. Formerly wben a
Britisb sbip on the China station needed repaire it had to go fromn the Pacific ocean up
to Malta. As bonourable senators are aware,
Malta is a small island in the Mediterranean.
Just now that is not a very safe place, for
in tbe Mediterranean there are islands, chan-nels and straits tbrough which the ses route
During the trouble in
to India passes.
Ethiopia tbere was a great concentration of
British naval strength in the Mediterranean,
and corne persons were disappointcd when the
fleet was recalled. But the British Admiralty
was perfectly right in the course it took. The
Sea Lords knew that Italy had a number of
esmaîl torpedo boats, eacb carrying a crew of
only two men. The Italian Government had
cal'led for sixty-six volunteers to man those
boats: one bundred and twenty responded to
the ceu. Each couple of men were in what
-wus virtually a huge torpedo, capable of a
speed of sixty miles an bour. The Italians
were prepared, if necessary, to use these smaîl,
speedy, deadly craft to ramn the British warships. Honourable senators can imagine what
miight bave h'appened. Undeubtedly many
of Great Britain's capital sbips would bave
been destroyed or disabled.
During tbe Great War we had a convincing
instance of the destructivenese of the modern
submarine. A submarine lef t Germany and
eventually reached the Spanish coast. It will
be remembered that at that time Spain ws
friendly to the Germans. An oul tanker, was
stationed conveniently off sbore and the submarine repleniished its tanks with gasoline.
But that kind of gasoline turned out to, be
unsuited for the submarine s engines. Her
captain then set bis course for the eastern
part of the Adriatie, travelling on the surface in tbe night-time in order to get the
fullest mileage fromn hie original fuel supply,
ând under water during tbe day. As bonour-

119

able senators are probably aware, it takes
more power to drive a suhmarine when sulbmerged. In the Adriatic he got a supply of
proper gasoline and took his boat to Gallipoli.
What bappened there? Three of the biggest
and best ships of the British Navy were sunk.
The crew of the ship attacked could net detect the position of the submarine fromn the
direction f rom which the torpedo came, because
the submarine after discharging the terpedo
dove under the battleship-her commander
was taking a tremendous risk-and remained
concealed on the other side. Then in a dýay
or two he repeated bis manoeuvre. One of
those three British warships torpedoed wus
the Majestic; 1 have forgotten the namnes of
the other two. Fortunately no lives were
lost, as the battieships were struck flot far
fromn shore and before they sa.nk there was
time to man the boats.
Perhaps I am straying a littie fr.om the
subjeet-matter under discussion, but when I
begin ta talk of this great Empire I find so
many things of interest to discuss that it is
hard for me to restrain myseif. The British
Empire did flot amount to very much before
I came into it.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I wus born in
1856. What population did the British Ilies
have then? Wbat population had Australia,
New Zealaud, and South Africa in those days?
As to India, there England had only the
right to trade; the British Goverument did
not take officiai possession until the Indian
Mutiny in 1858. How anybody, especially
one of my blood, can be blamed for being an
Imperialist, I am at a loss to understand.
Only yesterday the St. Jean Baptiste Society
chose to scnd me a letter requesting me to
asic the Rigbt Hon. Mackenzie King not to
proceed with the estimates for national defence. I replied: "I always thought the St.
Jean Baptiste Society was not a political
institution. The credits for national defence
were voted in anotber place, thanks to the
great ability of the present Hon. Minister of
Natioial Defence, and it is too late now to
talk about the matter. Furthermore, your

right to amend a money bill. If you are

may I remind him, in answer to his last

tabled a moment ago that the Aurora was sold
to the highest bidder at the request of the
Government of the United Kingdom.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Where is the Aurora
now?

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But that

cruiser and the submarines, he can easily estimate the profit to the purchaser.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is all right.

I complain of is that this so-called weakening
of the legislative arm against Communism was
accompanied by an assurance that the Red

PIIIVATE BILL-CENTRAL

FINANCE

CORPORATION
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce, to whoma was referred Bill C, an
Act respecting 'Central Finance -Corporation
and to change its name to "Household Finance
Corporation." have considered the said Biil
and noiw beg leave to report the same without
amendment.
I think it is only fair to say that the members of the committee were not quite unanimous in recommending the Bill.
The Senate xviii rememiber that hast year the
Banking and Commerce Committee gave a
great dt-'al of time and labour in an endeavour
to produce a satisfactory model bill which
lion, Mir. BLAOK.

shouid cover ail smail loan companies operating under Dominion charter. The resulting
bill proposed a drastic reduction of rate,
to a uniforma lexel, and reguiatory measures
to pi-excnt extortion. That bill. howex er, did
not heenme law. It was the hope, I think,
of ail members of this House that the Government wouid this year bring in legisiation along
the lins recommended by the Senate hast
year; but this bas not been done. On Thursday Iast the cnmmittee reported to the House
'
Bill H, an Act rcspecting Industriai Loan and
Finance Corporation, recommending the bill
without ameodment.
'hat bill indicated a
siight reduction in rates by the cnmpany from
the rates previousiy charged, and authorized a
fiat rate of 2 per cent a month, payable
monthhy as accrucd, not in advance.
Biii ýC, an Act respccting Central Finance
Corporation, nnw before this Huse, proposes
a siight reduction in the rates charged up to
date. It alhows a charge of 112 per cent a
month on boans secured by endorsed notes, and
2,1 per cent a month on boans secured by
chattel mnrtgage. I may sny, for purposes
of comparison. that wbereas the Industriai
Loan and Finance Corporation makes virtuaiiy
ail its loans on endorsed notes, the Centrai
Finance Corporation's boans are practicaliy aill
made on ahatted1 mnrtgages and ýtherefore the
reduction of the rates it charges on boans
made on endorsed notes will not mean much
lioess its business in that bine increases materîaliy.
My nwn view iq that the rates charged hy
thiese smaii boan companies are aul ton high.
It is quite truc that such companies fill a
need in our country, partictiharly in industrial
towns and cities-a need which is not met by
other lending institutions. It is aiso true that
such companies cannot function uniess they
are able to charge a rate nf interest higher
than the normal. Yet I think I arn vnicing
the opinion nf the committec in stating that
they shouid flot be allowed to charge more
than 2 per cent a mnnth, this to cover everything, inciuding ail costs and charges. This
Bill C permits the company to charge up to
2,1 per cent a month. 1 think that in their
minds the members nf the committee justifled
the recommendation ni this Bili on the ground
that in the legislation amending the Loan
Companies Act in 1934 a maximum rate of
212 per cent a month was fixed. There are oniy
three companies nperating under Dominion
charter-the
two
ahove-named
and
the

Discount and Loan Corporation. To the
cnmmittce it djd not seema reasonable that one
comp-any shnuld be aliowed to operate on
a 24ýper cent rate whiie anotiaer was restricted
to a 2 per cent rate.

MAItCH 8,1937
I (lesire to express the great need of general
legisiation covering ail small loan companies

incorporated under federal charter, and to
urge the Government to introduce legisiation
along that line at the earliest possible date,
which certainly should nut be later than the
next session of Parliamient.
Bonourable
MURDOCK:
Mr.
Bon.
senators, I should like to ask what would be
the result if this Bill were flot passed. Would
it not be to leave this company working under
its present Act and thus able to continue
charging higher rates than those proposed in
this Bill?
Bon. Mr. BLACK: The charter of this
company. which is now appIying for a change
in its naine, lapses in the month of March,
the present month.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: The licence lapses; not
the charter.
Bon. Mr. BLACK: Whatever it may be.
The company's counsel and other representatives before the committee expressed the fear
that if the Bill were not passed at this session
the company might flot be able to operate.
It is only fair to say that the Superintendent
of Insurance, who represents the departmnent,
and, I suppose, in this particular case represents the Minister, seemed to indicate to the
committee th-at there was not much ground for
that fear.
Hon. Mr. DUIFF: Bonourable senators, in
view of what the honourable Chairman of the
Banking and Commerce Committee (Bon.
Mr. elack) bas said, and of the importance
of this Bill, it seems to me that we should be
given an opportunity of studying it caref ully. I suggest, the-refore, 'that its further consideration be postponed until a week from
to-nigbt.
Bon. Mr. LITTLE: Honourable senators,
if the suggestion of the honourable gentleman
from Lunenburg (Bon. Mr. Duif) is followed,
we shal flot be playing f air witb the Central
The charter under
Finance Corporation.
whicb it bas been operating for the past eight
y-ears authorizes an interest rate of two and
one-baîf per cent. Now, however, the Department of Justice bas expressed an opinion whicb
makes it doubtful whether the company bas a
right te make such a charge, and the conipany's
licence may not he renewed at the end of this
montb. I know honourable members are
anxious to have a general bill brougbt down,
based on a tborough investigation of Joan
companies' rates with a view to reducîng tbem
below the present level. Apparently it bas
not been possible so far to introduce such
legislation this session. I should point out
that although the charter authorizes the rate

z

of two and one-half per cent, the company
has not been charging that rate, and under
the proposed amendaient it will operate on a
rate of two and one-quarter per cent. Under
these circunastances I do flot think it is fair
to delay the progress of the Bill. We are
given to understand that the other Bouse is
hurrying through its business, and if my
honourable friend's suggestion is adopted the
Bill may flot be deait wjth by that Bouse
before prorogation. I would therefore ask the
honourable senator fromn Lunenburg to withdraw bis proposai.
Bon. Mr. DUFE: I do flot quite agrep with
the remarks of my honourable friend from
London (Hon. Mr. Little). There is no reason why Parliament should prorogue until it
has deait with the business of the country. We
are only in the early weeks of March, and I
have suggested that this Bill stand over for a
week in order that honourable senators may
have an opportunity of studýying it more carefully. That suggestion is, I think, reasonable.
To rny mind the reduction in the rate of interest frorn two and one-half to two and onequarter per cent is not sufficient. I think these
loan companies are cbarging far too high
interest on boans.
Bon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: It is usury.
Boa. Mr. DUFF: My honourable friend beside me says it i.s usury. Ble is much more
outspoken than I arn; I arn somewhat more
diplomatic, and should flot like to go quite so0
far. If necessary, we should stay bere and
consider the Bill very carefully, and I certainly think that under the circumstances I
arn justified in asking that its further consideration be deferred until honourable rnerbers have been given sufficient time to study
the Bill and are in a position to decide what
is in the best interest of our people. Therefore
I repeat that we should delay action until, say,
a week from to-night.
Bon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would suggest
that we adjourn the discussion until Wednesday, when the merits of the Bill may lx further
discussed in cornrittee. If then more light ie
needed we can adjourn further consideration to
a later date. We may, however, corne to an
agreemnent as ta what is the fair thing to do
for the company, wbich has been operating for
sorne years. To rny very great surprise I have
learned that the company has loaned millions
of dollars to persons in the province of Ontario at the rate of interest authorized by its
charter. .Apparently there is need for institutions of this character. We have given second
reading to another Bill, which is down for third
reading to-rnorrow, and which limits the rate
of interest to 20 per cent.

124

SENATE

lon. Mr. BLACK: Two per cent per month.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
That makes
the interest 24 per cent a year. Yet the
Superintendent of Insurance, who has supervision of the administration of loan company
legislation. approved of the anendment contained in the other Bill, which will be before
is for third reading to-morrow, and expressed
his satisfaction that at last he had succeeded
in getting the interest rate down to 2 per cent.
This Bill allows interest on endorsed loans at
a rate not exceeding 11 per cent.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Per month.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -insteai of 2
per cent per month. On other ioans the rate
is not to exceed, 21 per cent. The Superintendent of Insurance argued that the company
could carry on business with a 2 per cent
rate, as is authorized by the other Bill. The
company stated that with the 2j per cent
rate it had earned only 4-7 per cent on its
capital investment. Apparently the figures
are correct, and certainly they do not show a
very large return to the investors.
The only difference of opinion between the
Department of Finance, as represented by the
Superintendent of Insurance, and the company
is as to the rate of 21 per cent on chattel
mortgages. This rate includes a certain
charge for examination of title, registration
of the chattel mortgage and other expenses.
The company says it needs the rate to ceover
these charges. Honourable members will
have to decide whether the company has made
out a case for this rate of 21 per cent, or
whether it should be reduced to 2 per cent.
It has been stated by the honourable Chairman of the Banking and Commerce Conmittee that the company has been charging
up to 21 per cent per month, that is to say,
30 per cent per annum, by including the
chattel mortgage expenses. The company
claims that if we refuse to pass this Bill
it will still have the right, under its charter,
to charge that 30 per cent rate. But the
Departnent of Justice has advised the
Superintendent of Insurance that in its opinion the charter authorizes the company to
charge for chattel mortgage expenses, net a
lump sum of $10. but only its actual expenditure under this head. On the strength of this
opinion the Superintendent of Insurance says
to the company, "You will have to show me
that you have spent $10 in chattel mortgage
expenditures." The company replies that it
cannot do se, because its employees do the
work. I cannot say off-hand whether it is
prepared to charge a lesser sum than the $10.
If, however, the company does not comply
with the requirement of the Department of
Finance, then the department may refuse to
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

renew the licence. The matter has been well
sifted and is fairly easy to decide. The conpany says it cannot carry on at 2 per cent.
True, it is prepared to accept a rate of 1L
per cent on endorsed notes, but it admits
that up to the present time it has made no
such loans--that virtually its entire business
is confined to loans on chattel mortgages.
,Hon. Mr. DUFF: I agree with the honourable leader of the House that 24 per cent a
month is altogether too high a rate of interest.
Indeed, he has stated that the Superintendent
of Insurance, a very capable officer of the
Department of Finance, has expressed the
pinion that the rates to be authorized by this
Bil, or, for that matter, the rates charged by
loan 'companies generally, are entircly too
high. It seems to me, in view of this state
of affairs, that we should give this Bill our
most serious consideration. I submit to
honourable members that it would be well for
us to study the Bill very carefull.
My honourable friend from London (Hon.
Mr. Little) says Parliament mv prorogue
within the next few weeks. But that possibility should not weigh with us iii dealing
with this measure. We are here to protect
persons who have to borrow small amounts of
money from loan conpanies, and I believe
everyone realizes that loan companies are
charging their clients too high rates. I have
no personal interest in this Bill. My sole
concern is that those who have to borrow from
loan companies shall get their loans as
cheaply as possible. I gather from my onourable friend's remark that Se is not quite clear
whvetlher the Bill is right or wrong. and in the
cireumstances I feel that I am perfectly right
in asking that ve give it further consideration.
We do not have to prorogue witlin one week
or two weeks, or even within two months.
For my part, I am willing to stay hpre until
the business of the country is conluded
properly.
With all due deference to the
honourable chairman of the conmittee and
his colleagues, who have given munh attention
to the Bill, I ask as a matter of courtesv that
its further consideration be deferred until a
week from to-night.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
members, I would point out that this discussion
is entirely out of order. The Banking and
Commerce Committee bas reported on this
Bill without amendment. Section 41 of Forms
of Proceeding of the Senate states:
If the report contains a bill withouît amiend-

ment it stands adopted without aui motion,
and the senator in charge of the Biill moves
that it be read the third tune on a future day.

That is when this discussion could take place.
When shall this Bill be read a third time?

MARCH 8, 1937
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: Next sitting of the
House.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Mr. Speaker, I cannot
agree with your ruling. Surely this Bill, after
being reported by the standing committee,
ehould be referred to Committee of the Whole
before it is read a third time. If my suggestion that further consideration of the Bill be
postponed for a week is not accepted, then
I should like to ask that the Bill be referred
to Committee of the Whole.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable members,
I must say that I do not know what the rule
is, but it seems to me that those of us who
are not members of the Banking and Commerce Committee should have some opportunity of learning something about this Bill.
As I understand it, the report of the committee has simply been presented; it has not
yet been adopted. If it is the rule of the
House that once the report is adopted it
cannot go to Committee of the Whole, I am
afraid that those of us who are not members
of the Banking and Commerce Committee
are not going to learn very much about the
Bill.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think we can
find an easy solution. Like my honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Calder), I have not looked
at the rule. This is a private Bill returned
to us from the committee without any amendment. According to His Honour the Speaker,
the next step is for someone to move the
third reading of the BillHon. Mr. DUFF: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am giving my
interpretation of the ruling of the Chair-but
I think it would be in order to move that the
Bill be not now read a third time, but be
referred to Committee of the Whole.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: No. I think my honourable friend is not quite right in stating the
rules of this House. My understanding of the
rules of this House and those of the other
Chamber is that a bill, when it is reported
from a committee, must go to Committee
of the Whole for consideration clause by
clause.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: It does not go to the
third reading.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Our rule is different
from that of the House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. DUFF I would move that this
report be not now received, but that it be
considered this day one week.

125

The Hon. the SPEAKER: I would call
the attention of the honourable member
(Hon. Mr. Duff) to Rule 128, which says:
Unless the Senate otherwise orders, a private
bill reported from a standing or special committee is not committed to a Conmittee of
the Wholeand to Rule 129:
No private bill shall be read a third time
the saine day on whieh it is reported from a
coimittee.
When shall this Bill be read a third time?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Next sitting.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It has been
moved by Hon. Senator Little, seconded by
Hon. Senator Murdock, that this Bill be
placed on the Order Paper for third reading
at the next sitting of the House. Is it your
pleasure to adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I would move in amendment that this Bill be not now read the third
time, but that it be referred Vo Comnittee of
the Whole.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: There is no motion
for the third reading.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: 'Ihere is a motion to
place it on the Order Paper for to-morrow. I
am not prepared to accept that motion. If
there is a motion to put it on the Order Paper
I can move in amendment that some other
action be taken. If His Honour the Speaker
rules that I am out of order in that, I am
prepared to move that the Bill be not placed
on the Order Paper for to-morrow, but that
it be placed on the Order Paper for one week
from to-night.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: You have heard
the motion, honourable members, and the
amendment thereto, that this Bill be not
placed on the Order Paper for third reading
at the next sitting of the House, but that it
be placed on the Order Paper for third reading on Monday next. Is it y.our pleasure to
adopt the amendment?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Before the amendment is voted on I should like to say a word
or two. I am sure that many members of
the House are in the same position as myself.
I am surprised that any company charges interest at the rate of 2A per cent a month. I
want to know why it is done.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Besides, I want to
know how many companies are operating in
Canada under such a law. L this a common
practice? Are there many of these companies? Are there many purely provincial

126

SENATE

conspanies doing tise saine thing? There is
a great deal of information that 1 should like
to have in connection with this Bill.
If the amendment, is carried we do not
get much furUher along. It seems to me that
the better course wcîîld bc to let the motion
pass. Then, if there is a desuire on the part
of members of this House t-o examine the
Bill and sec the reason for iýt. we can go into
Committee of the Whole.
Hon. Mr. DIJFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Whiie I arn on my
feet I m-ay say that there is one other point
I should like honourable members to consider. If there were only a few oif these comnpanies operating under federal charterHon. Mr. DANDURANU:
I understand.
that ýthere are two before us now and two
others operating under fedieral charter.
Is
that correct?
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: There arc thrce.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: The m-ernorandurn
which I read stated that there were three
companies operating smnder Dominion charter.
Two of these companies are beforc
this bouse now with applications to he
allowed to amiend their charters, and there
is a third cornpany operating under Dominion charter which would corne under any
amendment of the Loan Comipanies Aot of
1934, fixing the rate at not more than 2ý per
cent a mnondh.
Althouigh thi-zz discussion may be out of
order, pcrhaps I rnay take this opportuoity
to give a. littlec more information.
There
are in the, prov ince of Ontario a number of
boan companies operating under provincial
charter; there are, I think. several such
companlies in the province of Quebec; thiere
are twc or thrc last year there were thrce
-in
tise Maritime Provinces, As ail these
are operating undur provincial charter,' there
is no xvay in w'hich the federai branch
hure (ani secure information regarding the
charges they make. The Superintendent of
Insurance, whom I interviewed, and to whomn
I ivrote, in ordur to get this information,
replicd: "I have no mneans of getting at the
rates charged by provincial companies. but
they are atrocinus. I cannot give you definite
figures as to their charges, because they do
flot corne under my jurisdiction. but in some
instances the rates have amounted to 10C
per cent or more."
It is becauise of this
fact that the departmeot is encouraging
companies. as fýat as it possihly cao, to secure
Dominion charters.
I think it xva, clearl.v demonstrated before

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

follows:

The answer te
inquiry i.3 as

MARCH 8, 1937il
1. On June 16, 1936, the Senate of the
United States gave its advice and consent for
the ratification by the United States of the
convention hetween Canada and the United
States for the protection, preservation and
extension of the sockeye salmon fisheries in
the Fraser River system, signed at Washington, May 26. 1930.
2. This resolution of the United States
Senate was passed suhject to the following
undierstandings to he made a part of such ratification:
"(1) That the International Pacific Salmon
Fisheries Commission shall have no power to
authorize any type of fishing gear contrary
to the laws of the State of Washington or the
Dominion of Canada;
"(2) That the'Commission shall nlot promulgate *or onforce regulations until the scientific
investigations provided for in the conventilon
have been made, oovering two cycles of sockeye salmon runs, or -eight years; and
"(3) That the Commission shall set up an
advisory committee composed of five persans
fromn each country who shall be representatives
of the various branches of the industry (purse
seine, gi net, troll, sport fishing, and one
other), which advisory cnmmittee shall be
invited to ail non-executive meetings of the
Commission and shahl be given full opportunity to examine and to be heard on ail
proposed orders, regulations or recommenýdations."~
3. These understandings, which under existing practice and precedents constitute clarifications or interpretations upon administrative aspects, appear to be not inconsistent
with the principles and purpose of the convention. Accordingly the question of their
submaission ta Parliament. which confirmed the
convention in 1960, does not arise.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Honourable members, I should like to postpione any remarks
that 1 may seish to make upon this, suhject
until I have had an opportunity of reading
the answers which have just heen given.
Therefore I would move that the dehate be
adjourned until Wednesday next.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The terma "debate" is perhaps hardly correct, for there has
been no debate so far. The honiourable gentieman's inquiry has just heen answered, and if
he is not prepared to go ahead with any discussion n.ow I would suggest thart he simply
ask ito have his question stand on the Order
Paper.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Thut is quite satisI think,
though, that the rem:ark I made was in order.
factory to me, honourable senators.

I gave notice some time ago that I should
caîl attention to lthle Puget Sound-Frasei,
River sockeye treaty. I realize that we are
in the h«bit of proceeding thbe wrong way
about; that we discuss questions and roceive
answers to them aftterwarda. My deaire was
to proceed a little more in order by first having my inquiry answered and then discussing
the conditions diisclosed by the an.swer. It
makes no difféeonce to me how the notice is
plaeed on the O.rder Paper so long as I have
an opportunity of discussing the question
when I wish to discuss it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The procedure
has often struck me, to-o, as noit being strictly
logicial. An lionourable member calls attention of the Sonate to a certain matter and
asks a question. He waits tili the discussion
is finished hefore he receives his answer,
whereas if he had received his answer first
lie might have found it unnecessary to have
any discu.ssion at ail. I quite realize there
is mueli to he said in fiavour of the procedure
suggested. by my honourable friend, that the
answer should lie given first. I have answered
my honourabl-e friend's inquiry, and the only
point now is in what formn the matter may
appear on the Order Paper. lIt is suggested
that the question stand.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Until Wednesday.
PRAIRIE FARM REHABILITATION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 18, an Act to amend
the Prairie Farm Rehahilitation Act.
He said: Honourable senators wiIl recali
that in thbe session of 1935 Parliament enacted
a measure to provide for the rehahilitation of
drouglit and soul drifting areas in the provinces
of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. This
Bill seeks to modify four sections of that
statute.
Section 3 of the Act of 1935 provided for
the setting up of an advisory committee to be
composed of representatives of important organizations. Section 1 of this Bill repeals that
clause and provides by subsection 1:
The Governor in Couneil may estabhish one
or more advisory comnmittees te le known as
Prairie Farm Rehabihitation Commit/tees, the
members of which shall laid office during
pleasure.
When t/he honourable Minister of Agriculture presented the Bill in the other Bouse
lie st/ated that ho intended to retain that
large advisory committee to advise him on
matters of general policy. lIt is composed of:

SENATE

(a) one represenftative of the Manitoba grain
growing fairniers from the drought and soil
drifting areas;
(b) one representative of the Saskatchewan
grain growing farmers froi the drought and
soit drifting areas;
(c) one representative of the Alberta grain
growing fariers from the drought and soil
drifting areas;
(d) one representative of Saskatchewan live
stock fariers from the drouglt areas;
(e) one representative of Alberta range
farmsers from the drouîght areas;
(f) one representative of mortgage companies
of Canada;
(g) one representative of the Canadian
Bankers? Association;
(h) one representative each froin the Canadian Pacifie Railway Company and the Canadian
National Railways;
(i) two representatives from the Dominion
Department of Agriculture; and
(j) one representative of the Governmnent in
each of the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta.
The local advisory committees will be
composed of persons familiar with the local
areas affected. They will act without remuneration. The Minister thinks that the members
of those local committees will be able to help
him in solving the very important problems
confronting the drought areas.
Section 2 provides:
Section four of the said Act is repealed and
the following substituted therefor:
"4. The advisory coimittees shall consider
and advise the Minister as to the best inethods
to bc adopted to secure the rehabilitation Of
the drouglt and soil drifting areas in the
provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and
Alberta, and to develop .and proinote within
these areas systeis of farn practice, tree ciilture, water supply. landi utilization and land
settlemient that will afford greater econoici
security and to inake such representations

thereon to the Minister as the advisory coinittees nay decin expedient."
The purpose is to give more scope to the
committees in making recommendations.
Section 3 is a consequential amendment.
Section 4 repeals section 8 of the Act and
substitutes tierefor:
o

"18. For the pirposes of this Act the G vernor

in Council eay froms tinse to tiie authorize the
expenditusre in each of the fiscal years 1937-38
to 1939-40, inelusive, of sies iot exceeding the
anonut appropriated iby Parliaient in each

year for such puirposes."
Clause 8 of the Act autiorized an expenditure of $750,000 for the first year and
S1.000,000 annially for the next four years.
Dsuring the first two years that the Act lias
been in force only $850,000 ias been expended.
The Depariment of Agriculture proceeded
slowlv at the outset, while the work was in
the experimental stage.

If this Bill passes the

expenditure will be limited to
voted annually by Parliament.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

the

sums

It is needless to say that these advisory
committees will benefit by the experience
of the neiglbouiring American states. The
consmittees may recommend tree culture and
vater supply, land utilization and land settlement. The afflicted section of Western Canada
covers some 20 municipalities in Manitoba,
150 in Saskatchewan, and 100 in Alberta.
Having made this explanation, I move the
second reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: How many advisory
committees are likely to be appointed under
section 3 as aimended? Under the old section
the advisory committee was composed of
representative men without pay. There may
be an unlimited number of advisory comI
mittees under the section as amended.
presume those committees will be paid.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

No.

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: None of them?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

No.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Except the chairman. Under this Bill the chairman is to be
appointed by the Minister; under the Act he
was appointed by the Governor in Council.
In both cases, I think, the chairman is paid.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: I know the chairmsan
is paid. Under section 3 of the Act no
members of the coimittee were paid, except
probably the cliairman.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
Minister of Agriculture stated to the other
House that the advisory committees were not
to be paid.
Hon. Mr GILLIS: Except the chairman.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
that exception.

I did not notice

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Section 1 of the
Bill reads:
Section three of Tie Prairie Farmî Relabilitation Act. chapter twenty-three of the statutes
of 1935, is repealed and the fo.llowing substituted
tierefor:
-3. (1) The Covernor in Cosunscil imay establish one or iore advisory comiittees to be
known as Prairie Fari Reihabilitation Committees. the members of which shall hold office
dinic ssg pleasure.
Subsection 2 is important:
One of the meibers of each advisory coninttee shall be appointed chairman thereof by
the Minister.
Would the honourable leader kindly tell us
how many committees are to be appointed, and
whether all the chairmen are to be remunerated?

MARCH 8, 1937
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Section 3 of the
Act reads:
The Governor in Council may establish a
committee to be known as the Prairie Farm
Rehabilitation Advisory Committee, hereinafter
called "the Committee," the members of which
shall hold office during pleasure.
(2) One of the members of the Committee
shall be appointed Chairman by the Governor
in Council.
The section as amended reads:
(1) The Governor in Council may establish
one or more advisory committees, to be known
as Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Committees,
the members of which shall hold office during
pleasure.
(2) One of the members of eaeh advisory
committee shall be appointed chairman thereof
by the Minister-instead of by the Governor in Council. My
honourable friend wants to know how many
advisory committees will be appointed?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: And whether the
chairman of each committee will be paid.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I cannot answer
the latter question of my honourable friend.
All I know is that the present advisory committee is to be retained. I will secure the
information and give it to my honourable
friend on the motion for third reading of the
Bill.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: All right.
Hon. W. M. ASELTINE:
Honourable
senators, I do not like the provisions of this
Bill. Conservation of the soil is very important to us in Western Canada, where we
have had drought in many districts for the
past five or six years, and I should not care
to see the committee mentioned in section 3
of the Bill done away with.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
done away with.

It will not be

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: It seems to me
one of the purposes of section 3 is to appoint
a new committee in place of the old one. I
am afraid if the Act is amended according
to this Bill we may have 160 committees in
Saskatchewan, or one in each of the rural
municipalities which constitute the drought
area. With so many committees the Act
would be much more expensive to administer.
Another objectionable feature of the Bill is
that there are to be no more definite appropriations in any year as under the Act. I am
afraid that the Government, not appreciating
the seriousness of the drought which has
afflicted Western Canada, may not appropriate
sufficient funds to carry on the rehabilitation
work.
I should like to point out that the United
States Government is undertaking a very ex31117-9j

131

tensive program. In the Regina Daily Star
of March 1 I find the following dispatch from
Washington:
Congressional leaders estimated to-day the
United States Administration's program to
bring parity and security to agriculture may
require upwards of $1,000,000,000 a year.
The major part would be needed, members
of the House of Representatives Agriculture
Committee said, for these items:
Soil conservation, $500,00,000.
Crop insurance, $100,000,000 to $150,000,00.
Congress already has voted $50,000,000 for
emergency seed and feed loans and has received
bills calling for $5,000,0 for eradication of
grasshopper and insect plagues.
I would impress on the Government the fact
that in the Western Provinces we have, as
stated by the Hon. Minister of Agriculture the
other day, a drought area almost as large as
that in the United States. I do not like to
sec the appropriations cut down; on the contrary, I should prefer to see them very much
increased. For that reason, I repeat, I am
sorry that section 4 of the Act is so amended
that in future there will be no definite appropriation each year.
While on my feet I may mention that soil
drifting is disastrous to any agricultural
country. Under the section to be substituted
we find:
The advisory com.mittee shal consider and
advise the Minister as to the best methods to
be adopted to secure the rehabilitation of the
drought and soil drifting areas in the provinces
of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta.
Perhaps honourable members do not know
that if the drifting takes away the top two
inches of soil, the loss is equivalent to that
resulting from continuous cropping year after
year for twenty years. In numerous parts of
the West as well as of the United States soil
drifting has been going on for many years,
and much more than two inches of the top
soil has disappeared. In other parts it has
piled up over fences and woods to such an
extent that country which formerly was level
is now of a rolling nature.
Mesopotamia, the birthplace of man, was
at one time the most fertile country in the
world, but to-day as an agricultural country
it is virtually non-existent by reason of soil
drifting. The same sort of change has taken
place in the Sahara desert and, along the
Nile, and it is occurring in the Panhandle of
the United States, and in parts of Saskatchewan, Alberta and Manitoba.
I should like to point out to honourable
members of this Chamber that in the province of Alberta very drastic legislation has
been passed to control soil drifting. This
legislation is called "an Act to encourage
methods of cultivation to control soil drifting." It provides that certain methods of

trees, the darnming of water and other
methoda adopted to stop the drifting of the
Soul.
I suppose that under this Bill much money
will be spent in troc planting. It is useless to
plant trees or grew hedges in your fields until
you bave stopped the drifting of the soil;
and, the only way to do that is by strip farming and the proper cultivation of your strips.
If you work the land up too fine wjth a dise
barrew it will blow even if you have the strips;
in fact, aftor mo'nths of dry weathor, I have
seen soul blow inside a high huard fonce.
Before the Goverom-ent spends large sums of
money on planting trees or hodges it should
stop the drifting of the soul, by some such
mothod as I have advocatedý; then the expenditurc on the planting and, growing of
trees and hedges and the building of dams
will not ho a total loss.
I wish to ropeat that I do not like this Bill.
I do nlot think the advisýory oummittea established. under section 3 of the Act of 1935
should bo done away with, and I think the Bill
should mention a d-efinite sumn that will be
spent eacb year. But even if the Bill is
passed in its present form 1 arn sure the
Minister of Agriculture will have in mind the
1
fact thbat a great doal of money is guing
to be roquired in order to reclaim certain
portions of Western Canada. 1 tbink he is
convinced that thoso portions are worth saving.
For ten years in sucecession the Western Provines produced a billion dollars a yoar of now
woalth and wveie largely responsible for the
prosperity of Canada, particularly that of
Eastern Canada. Therefore I would ask the
Government to make sure that a sufficiont
suma is appropriated each year to savo the
great Western country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senaturs, 1 desiro tu answer the questions
wbich have been put to me. I have taken
the trouble, as is my duty, to follow ail the
explanations given by tbe Minister of Agriculture. I could bave brougbt bis statemont
to this Chamber in the form of a brief, but
I shahl content myself with suggesting to
those wbo are interestod in the matter that
in the statoment of tbe Minister of Agriculture tbey will find a complete picture of
the desolation in the drought areas of the
West. I believe tbat the Western Provinces,
wbicb are su cruelly afflictod, are to be congratuiated on the fact that the Minister of
Agriculture is a representative of the West wbu
for a long time Ivas at the bead of the Guvernment of Saskatchewan, and wbo knows at
first hand most of the problems that confront
him.
He bas f oit that bosides this large

13,3

advisory committee, a committee very well
chosen, and une which he intends te maintain-for I must take bis statement tu the
othor House-be wiIl gather together in certain areas groups of public-spirited men who,
thuugh not iuterested directly, will be iuterested in the rehahilitation of thuse areas wbich
are suffering su severely. Hie believes, and
I am sure nu une will gainsay bis hope, that
by gatbering together a certain number of
mon-be dues net give the figures-be will
get mure information than ho would from
une or twu representatives upun the large
cummittee. Tbat stands te reasun. 1 wonder
if representatives frum the West would net
bold with the suggestion that the more heads
put together the greater the wisdum.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Wbat I arn oh.iecting te is tbe fact tbat it may cost a lot
of money te do the work in the way proposed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 arn informed
that tbe7 chairmen of these cemmittees may
ho remunerated.
I de net see that in the
statement of the Ministor of Agriculture. I
wiil make certain about it and will hring
the information te this Chamber for the third
reading. Even if my honourable friend is
correct in bis contention, from tbe ton or
twelve mon gatbered tugether une could be
selected wbuse special duty it would ho te
give mnst of bis time te the solution of these
problems. There will ho se many millions
spent te rohabilitate the drought section that
any expenditure mado in the way of romuncration would eut a vcry small figure.
My bonourable friend says tbat ho dues net
like te soc the provision of the 1935 Act,
whîch specifies the amount te ho expended,
dune away with. Vet ho tells us ho bas read
the statement of the Minister of Agriculture.
Wbat did the Minister say? He said the
sums mentiuncd in that Act would net ho
enougb. Tbe Americans are providing $500,000,000. There is ne amnunt at whicb we
ean stop, saying we shahl net need more in
ordor te de a perfect job. Realizing tbat the
country bas its financial limitations, I foc!
tbat te say we shaîl spend $750,000 this year
and $1.000,000 noxt year would ho te fix an
insýufficient sum. We may neod te go forward
and spend some millions of dollars for the
purpose of oarrying eut a well studied and
well planned sebeme. I have yet te learn
that my Western friends have any fear about
tbe amount that the Minister of Agriculture
may ask from the House of Communs for
such a fine work as the rehabilitation of these
setions. I feel tbat the roasun the fixod
amounts bave been dune away with is that

unnecessary. My reason is this. The select
comimittee considered the Bill in detail very
thoroughly, and although not quite half of
the honourable members of the Senate are
members of that committee, every senator
has a right to be present at the committee's
meetings and to hear all the evidence adduced.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: But all senators do
not get notice.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They do not
get specific notice, it is true, but they all know
when the committee is sitting, and they have
a right to be present and to express themselves. The only disability of non-nembers
in the committee is that they have no vote;
but, as all honourable senators know, that
does not matter much, because the main responsibility of the committee is not voting,
but rather discussion and hard work on the
principle and phraseology of the bill. However, if it is desired by the honourable leader
and members generally that this Bill go to
Committee of the Whole, I have no objection.
I should point out, however, that if we folilow
this procedure in one case we may be called
upon to follow it in all, and furthermore, that
in Committee of the Whole we can never
give a bill that intimate consideration which
we are able to give it in a select committee.
While on my feet I want to say something on the general subject-matter of this
Bill, and I am just as well able to do so on
the motion for third reading-and so is
every other honourable member-as when
tie Bill is in Committee of the Whole. Any
discussion that can be of service now can
take place on the motion for third reading,
for the question to be considered is not
whether the Bill should be phrased in this
way or in that, but rather whether or not
we want a bill of this kind.
I approach this subject just as the honourable senator from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr.
Duff) has approached it, and as almost anyThe honourable
body would approach it.
senator reads the measure and says we are
now authorizing a company to charge the
poorer class of borrowers 2¾ per cent a
month, a very high rate of interest, three
or four times as high as the rate the banks
are permitted to charge under our Bank Act.
One naturally asks why these rates should
No honourable member of
be permitted.
this House will vote to permit them unless
he is convinced that to do so would be in
the interest of the public of Canada, or, at
all events, of the class of people alleged to
be served by these loaning institutions. He
will not vote to do this merely because the
institutions want it. He knows that the rate

137

is high and imposes a fearful penalty upon
those in trouble. Therefore every honourable member has to be convinced that it is
better for the country to have these institutions than not to have them, and that if
lower rates are imposed we cannot have
them. Every honourable member must be
convinced of both these things before he
can justify a vote in favour of the Bill.
Anyone who seeks to establish both these
things undertakes a somewhat formidable
and unpopular task; but, unpopular though
it may be, I cannot see how we can avoid
it. Those who have only scanned this measure and looked in the press of the country
for information to enable them to decide
upon its merits have not had the advantage
of the lengthy study which the committee
has made, and have not been faced with the
very surprising facts presented to the committee. The study which we have made of
this subject has convinced, me that the
country would be better with these institutions than without them, and that if we do
not allow necessitous borrowers to bear the
burdens which these institutions impose we
leave them a prey to those who would impose vastly heavier burdens; we deny them
relief on terms which, though onerous, are
far Iss; onerous than those to which they
would otherwise have to submit.
It is perhaps unknown to certain honourable members of the House that the commitee of last year dealt with measures similar to this for about three months, and that
the same subject was one of our principal
studies last session. We gave more time to
it than to all other measures combined:, and
I fancy that many members of the committee changed or modified their views as
a result of evidence and arguments then
adduced. This session we reviewed it in a
much briefer space of time, because we felt
the work was mainly done.
Now, what were the reasons which led
the committee to the opinion that it was
better to permit these institutions to exist
than to prevent them from continuing their
operations? First of all, we were confronted
with the result of an examination of the
whole problem in the United States by what
is called the Russell Sage Foundation. This
is a foundation established for the purpose
of public service, particularly to the least
favoured, elements of the community. I do
not know what induced it to make the special

perhaps the Senate and House of Representatives there, were confronted with bills

made at all events, and it was a very thorough one, extending over a long priod of

138

SENATE

time. The Foundation reported there was a
field of service here whjeh had to be filled
and that it could bo filled only at certain
rates-rates at Ieast comparable with those
fixed as the maxima in this Bill. Whjle I
have flot the exact figures in my memory, I
am qafe in saying that the maxima declared

Then it wvas brought to our attention that
notwithstanding the existence in Canada of
qutte an array cf companies doing business

money lenders here, there and cverywhere,
ge îting far higher rates than companies wvcre

Hen. Mr. DANDURAND:

Rigbit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But there are
a large number of previncial cempanies. In
Toronto and ether papors I sc advertisemonts hby these companies offerieg their serviecs te the public. Yeti can sec snucb advertisomeets on the street car, tee, as yen ride
home. These cempanies are net, under our
supervision at aIl, altbongb it seems te me
that if wo passed a general law dealing with
this thing they wonld bave te cerne under it,
because the law would bave te de witb ieterest,
wbicb is a federal responsibility. In my

MARCH 9, 1937
judgment we should have a general baw.
We should fix a maximum rate which could be
Iived up to by these companies, and we
sbould punîsh to the limit everyone, whether
one of these companies or an outsider, who
exceeda that maximum. I do not think we
shall ever get into a position where we can
bring under the supervision of the Department
of Insurance those rnen who exact horrifying
rates, and can punisb thern according to their
fault, until we provide for some legitimate
companies to fill the field.
It will be asked why it is necessary to
bave a rate as bigb as 214 per cent a rnonth.
That is a figure arrived at after very long
evidence and detaiied statisties, as established
by experience, not of one, but of many companies. Certain companies mucb srnaller than
this one and- not as well equipped, and
especiably companies not having access to the
vast* reservoir of cbeap capital now availbhe
in the United States, have toid me tbey simply
cannot do this business at 2,, per cent, and
for tbat very reason tbey are against this
measure. Tbey fear it will bead to the establishment of a 2*4 per cent rate, which would
put them out of business and contribute to the
success of this larger company. I arn not at
ail intimating that this reason is at the bottom
of any opposition bere; I arn sirnply stating
wbat I bave been told.
It is true there was one measure passed
wbicb lirnited the rate to 2 per cent, but it
was sbown that the class of business donc and
intended to be donc by the cornpany willing
so to limit its rate was not tbe same as that
being done by Household Finance Corporation, whicb is sponsoring this measure, or hy
other companies. which say tbey cannot exist
if not perrnitted to charge more than 2* per
cent. Th.e class of business donc at the lower
rate inay be described as baving to do with
horrowers who are able to secure' endorsers of
known standing and are .Iust beneatb tbe
stratum served by the banks, or perhapa in
many cases even corne into tbat stratum. Tbey
are above the stratum of those who have te
mortgage their furniture-of those deait witb
by Housebold Finance Corporation-and they
can be served more cheaply hecause naturaily
and necessarily the expense of conducting
business is on a lower scabe. That is the clasa
served hy the company whicb xvas content to
submait to a maximum of 2 per cent a month.
The company serves more than that clasa, for
it goes into tbe mortgage cbass alan, but only
to a very smabl proportion. The llouseboid
Finance Corporation is almost wholiy a mortgage company. 1 have no reason to doubt its
statement that tbougha in the last four years
it has loaned to 86,000 horrowers some $15,-

139

000,000, ail but a smali fraction of one per
cent of which was, 1 think, upon chattel mortgages, it has neyer made a single seizure and
neyer sued.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: 1 was going to ask my
right honourable friend wbether companies of
this kind took securities before making loans.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. 1 arn
referring now to the less desirable subdivision
of this business. TIhe more desirable part is
the endorsed note business, wbere there is no
security except the endorser. A company engaged rnainly in that class can keep within
a lower maximum than a company doing
business of the other class. Among the cornpanies doing the more desirable class of
business is that one wbich is agreeable to a
2 per cent rate. Other companies say they
cannot possibly exist on that rate, because
thev have to make detailed examinations of
goods and tbey must go more fully into the
borrower's -character and rncthods of living.
They cdaim it is necessary for bhemn to do a
certaïn arnount of educational work for
many a borrower, and apparently tbey do try
to arrange bis finances and me-thods of payment. All this coats money. These companies say, "We are willing to make loans on
endorsed notes at flot more than 1ý per cent"
-and so the Bibi provides-"but in the more
perilous field we cannot operate under 2-1 per
cent." And ýother companies corne to us
and say: "We have to serve a wider constituency. We are unable to get access to
United States capital and so bave to borrow
from banks. We object to this Bill because
it imposes limitations under whiich we cannot
exigt."
1 have endeavoured to give a brief history
of the subi ect. [n the face of this record,
this study, the evidence placed before us,
wbat can we do? If we Vurn these companies
down there will stibi be the provincial companies, over wbich we have no control. The
field is not ncupied. The viobator of the
law will be able to go here, there and everywhere and no amount of scrutiny wîll be able
to stop hdm, unless we provide sources to
which borrowers may go. Il we provide
such sources, unincorporated lenders wibl becorne s0 few that we shall be able to controil
and punish them. A certain condition has
existed from the birth of time and is ever
going to exiat, a condition wbich cannot be
prevented by any economy devisable by man.
Sureby it àa the duty of Parbiarnent to face
that situation as it is and provide for it in
tbe mnst equitable manner possible. For my
part, I arn convinced it is along the bines of
this measure we shall find the most equitable

MARCH 9, 1937
Loan and Finance Corporation. That company desires to corne under the rate of 2
per cent a month; that is, 24 per cent. The
Bill bas obtained the endorsation of the Department of Finance, as represented by the Superintendent of Insurance. Be considers it a
great stcp forward to have one of the three
companies expecting to do business at 2 per
cent a month. That company does the larger
part of its business on endorsed notes, and
outside the province of Quebec some business
on chatte] mortgages. 1 think we shoutd accept the principle contained in that Bill, which
witt be before us for third reading this afternoon.
Now I corne to the Bill before us. The
Central Finance Corporation expeets to reduce
its rate of interest on chatte] mortgages fromn
2j per cent to 241 per cent. The company
says, "We w-il] make loans on e.ndorsed notes
at 1-1 per cent." The Superintendent of Insurance replies that the company may well
be generous in that class of loans because virtually it does not do any such business; its
principal business lias to do with chatte!
mortgages.
In the Ba.nking and Commerce ýCommittee
we had to decide if we would report this Bill
with a 24L
per cent rate when the Department
of Finance insisted upon 2 per cent-a rate
which the Industrial Loan and Finance Corporation accepted. I was in a difficult position, for I did not want Vo take a stand which
might flot be that of the Minister of Finance,
to whose 4control are assigned loan companies.
The committee decided to report the Bibl with
the rate at 21 par cent. I think that if we
had provided for a fiat rate of 2 per centas in Btil] H, to which I have already referred
-honouraýble memýbers, after listening to the
explanation by the Tight honourable gentleman,
would vote for the third .reading- of this Bitl.
We are 110w facing this question, as I said
yesterday: Shall we send this Bill to, Committee of the Whole in order to discuas the
desirabi]ity of makcing a flat rate of 2 per
cent? I should be disposed to support the
Bill as it bas been reported Vo us by a
mai ority of the members of the Banking and
Commerce Committee. I mention the lack
of unanimity because the honourable chairman perhaps violated the rule in stating that
there was disagreement in the committee.
However, I think we should accept the report
as that of the whole committee.
Some Hon. SENA-TORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDTJRAND: 1 arn disposed
to abide by its decision and ask that the Bill
be sent to the Bouse of Gommons in its
present form. But 1 would draw the attention

141

of its sponsor to the resistance that hie may
have Vo meet from the Hon. Minister of
Finance in the other Bouse, and from the
Superintendent of Insurance should the Bit]
be referred to a committee of the Commons.
I arn somewbat fearfu] of the resu]t. I was
strongty impreased with the view that there
shoubd not be two rates of interest, and that
we shoutd niake an effort to have the promoters of the Bill accept a fiat rate of 2
per cent. My reason for not objecting to
reference of the Bill to Committee of the
Whole is the disabitity under which. I labour
of having to represent here the Department of
Finance, which, through its representative before us, the Superintendent of Insurance,
sternly objected Vo a 30 per cent rate. As I
have said, the main difference in the Bankîng
and Commerce Committee w-as as to accepting
the rate of 24 per cent a month or enforcing a
flat rate of 2 per cent.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Is the interest at the
rate of 2j per cent a moýnth cottectibte
monthly?
An Bon. SENATOR: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: If it is not paid reguliarly
is the interest compounided each month?

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIEýN: The effective
rate is 2j per cent a month; it is not 27 per
cent a year payable monthly, whieh would
run away Above a 27 per cent effective rate.
If a boan is not repaid as provided in the Bit],
then the 2* per cent woubd, I think, apply to
the arrears until they were paid: they would
be due fromn day to day.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: And interest would be
charged on Vhem?
Right Hon. Mr. MEICGHEN: Yes. The
company cannot charge more than 2* per cent
on anything, but it can charge that much.
The important point is, it is the effective rate;
it is not just a nominat rate in the way of
discount.
I thi.nk the Bouse ought to understauid,
too, that after prety thorough consideration
by the Banking and Commerce Committee
over several years, we have severat coinpanies now doing business on the 2* per
cent rate. The onby reason this company
is before us is that as a result of some new
ruling by the D.epartment of Justice in respect of a part of that rate, which takes the
f orm. of a charge for the chatte] montgageit is a]!' part of the rate, it is not additionatthe company witl be seriously prejudiced
when it app]ies for a renewal of its licence;
I think, thîis month. If the licence is not
renewed the company wilt just have to go

under the authority of Parliament will continue doing business at the 21 per cent
rate, even though we refuse this company,
which has been doing business for years, a
right to continue at 24 per cent.

of interest charges under this Bill. The
answer is to be found in section: 4, which
prescribes the charges which may be made
on endorsed and other loans, and then proceeds:

Hon. Mr. DUFF: We are told that if this
Bill does not pass, and the company does
net get a renewal of its licence, it will be
put out of business. I understand that one
of the principal reasons for the Bill is the
desire to change the present name of Household Finance Corporation or amalgamate it
with the Central Finance Corporation, which
would then obtain another licence.

be paid, deducted or received in advance or
conpounded and all suci charges shall be
comtputed and paid only on unpaid principal
balances on the basis of the number of days
stu balances reinain unpaid, and for the purpose of such computations a month shall be
any period of thirty consecutive days.
I am against what is generally known as
the loan shark business first, last and all the
time. and I hope I have sense enough to
take a step in the right direction when I get
a chance to do so. That is why I think it
would be unfortunate if this Bill were net
given third reading.
Why is this Bill before us? Many unkind
things have been said about the Senate in
years gone by. I think not long ago I heard
a rumble from another place about a general
campaign of economy which would eliminate entirely the Senate of Canada.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is just a
change of name.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: But if this Bill does
not pass, the Household Finance Corporation
will still continue in business.
Riglt Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: But it has to
get a renewal of its licence.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
And if the
company does not conform to the policy of
the Department of Finance as settled by the
Department of Justice, then the Finance
Department may refuse to renew the licence.
Hon. Mr. DUTFF: Is the Honsehiold Finance
Corporation net operating under a charter
from this Parliament?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But it has
to have a licence, renewable every year.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This is a Bill
to allow the Central Finance Corporation
to change its name to Housetold Finance
Corporation.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I do not know which is
which. If this Bill does net pass, am I not
correct in stating that the Central Finance
Corporation can still do business under its
original charter?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, it cannot.
If the Finance Departnent decides that the
coumpany bas net conformed to the law, then
the department may refuse a licence to the
Central Finance Corporation next April.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Are the other companies which are charging 21 per cent to
be refused licences too?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND? I do not know
whethcr the 2, per cent is collected as fees
on chattel mortgages.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: There are many
people who cannot sec the promised day for
Canada until that comes about.
But what have we been doing with this
Bill? On the 10th day of February it received its first reading in this House. On
the 15th day of February it received its
second reading, and the principle of the Bill
was discussed to some slight extent. The
Minutes of Proceedings of the Senate of
Canada do not suggest that the honourable
senator from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duff) or
the honourable senator from Winnipeg were
in their seats on that particular day.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: The honourable
gentleman refers to the other senator from
Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I refer to the
honourable the junior senator from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. Haig). On the 15th, after some
discussion the Bill was sent forward to the
Banking and Commerce Committee. The
consideration given it by that committee,
though not covering the whole field, was
sufficient in view of the fact that last year
the whole general question of loan companies
had been gone into exhaustively. On the
15th of February the right honourable senator
from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham)
referred to the efforts made last year to have
a model bill drafted in respect of the loan
company
business. Now, nothing having
been donc in that direction, we have before
us the proposal that this Bill, which is up for

MARCH 9, 1937
third readýing, should be put over until
Friday next and then be considered in Coinmittee of the Whobe. If the suggestion had
been that the Bill go to Committe of the
Whole to-day, so, that we might hear what
honourable members have to say about it, I

arn not sure but I would have said amen; but
postponement t& Friday next means that the
Bill woubd be delayed until some time next
week. In other w-&rds, the Senate of Canada
would be taking considerably

more than a

month to get through the first, second and
third readings of this Bill.
If the Bibi does flot pass what will be the
resuit? I do flot know. It is said that this
company will probably be denied tbe right to
continue to do business.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Why?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:- Because of the fact
tbat the Government of Canada believes, as

I understand, that the rate of 2ý per cent is
too high, and consequentby the Superintendent

of Insurance will not issue a licence even
tbough the company has a charter under the
law.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I suggest that that is not
the reason.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Well, it is not a
drearn. I think that if rny honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Haig) had been in the Banking
and Commerce Committee when those who
were supposed to be experts in these matters
were giving their evidence, he might bave
received that impression.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I was there and heard
everything.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: W.hat I arn partieularly afraid of is t.his. I arn told that there
are in OntarÀo some seventy fly-by-night boan
shark companies or associations which are not
working under a charter of the Fedýeral Goveroment or of any provincial government.

They are doing business on the strength of
wbat, sorneone lias described, as their hardness,
and they are getting away with it. The way
they work. I arn told, is-to instance one
particular company, which I shall caîl the
Queer SeIf-bielp Financial Association-to have
it whispered that that company is ready to
lend money to a fellow named Jim Murdock,
who is in hard luck and needs $100. He goes
to those people and asks tbem, "How are
chances?" They say: "Oh, yes. You want

Hon. Mr. DUFF: Would the honourable
gentleman join the association under those
conditions?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: No. But unf ortunately there are perhaps thousands of people
in Canada who are so poor that they need
financial assistance even more than the honourable senator from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duif)
or the honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon.
Mr. Murdock), and who would reach out and
grasp at something of that kind.
If a company that has been doing business
for a number of years on the basis of 2' per
Cent, which we 'think is too high, says týhat it
is ready to reduce its rate to 2j per cent for
certain loans, are we to say to it: "No.
We cannot do anything for you. Your licence
will probably not bc renewed after the 3lst
of March. Then there wlll be a widcr field
for these loan shark companies-if there are
such-that are taking advantage of the unfortunate"? I do flot think so. Therefore I
think we should not defer this matter any
longer, but should give the Bill third reýading.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: I entirely agree witb
the honourable senator from Lunenburg (Hon
Mr. Duif). Whatever may be the law or the
wrongful practices in the province of Ontario,
I refuse to ait idly by and say nothing when
bis of this kind are going through this Rouse.
To my mind this is class legisiation. You are
taking away from him that hath not that which
he seemleth to have, and are giving to a man
who has money.
Another serious phase of this question is
the fact that everything that goes to these
companies wbich have sprung up and are
loaning millions of dollars goes to the country
to the south of us. This is reflected in the
reduction in the rate of carninga of our banka.
The banks are controlled by the Governrnent,
and if those who arc lending money have a

chance to invest in anytbing which will yield
25 per cent they will not deposit their money
in the banks, and so it is prevented frorn
flowing into legitimate channels. The banks
would be willing and eager to lend money
for legitimate purposes, but they are not doing

the business they might do if it werc not for
these companies. They are refusing boans to
men who are perfectby honeat and who over a
period of twenty years have the record of
meeting their responsibilities. For this re.ason
I am opposed to the Bill, and refuse to be a
consenting party to any measure that would
permit a higher rate of interest than 1ý per
cent a rnontb.

Hon. A. D. McRAE: As one of the members
of the cornmittee who were opposed to this
Bibi I miay say now that I arn going to vote

SENATE
for it. Honourable members may be interested
in knowing why. I was opposed to the passing
of any more legislation with respect to such
comupanies as this, in the hope tiat the
Government would bring in a standard bill
and the Sonate would not be importuned
every session in regard to a matter which few
are able to understand unless they give a
great deal of time to the study of interest
schedules which have been prepared and are
really actuarial problens. I was very mucb
opposed to this Bill when it came before the
committee. I changed my view only after
the statement was made that this company
would not be granted a licence unless it would
consent to a rate of 2 per cent.
As the
honourable leader of the Government said,
the rate was reduced from 2-45 to 2-25. as I
renember it. or by approximately one-quarter
of one per cent.
It seems to me that this conpany lias been
subject to a bit of coercion, for it was only
after it had been carrying on business along
the sane lines for eight years that an opinion
of the Department of Justice raised some
question as to whether its methods were in
compliance with its charter, and the Suiperintendent of Insurance thrcatened to refuse to
renew its licence. This company has $3,500.000
out in loans, and has a good many thousands
of clients, yet if we do not pass this Bill the
company will be out of business. Inasnuch
as the rate has been reduced from 2-45 to 2-25
per cent, I think the only thing we can do is
to pass the Bill and give the company a right,
such as has been given to many other companics, to continue its operations as they
have been carried on during the past eight
years.
I may say that I am opposed to this form
of legislation, and I again call the attention
of the leader of the Government to the urgent
desirability of the Government bringing in a
standard bill next session, so that we may be
relieved of the necessity of dealing with this
contentious business every year.
It is truc that the public has no grasp
whatever of the situation so far as these
companies are concerned. It was suggested
in the committee-I think by the companies
thensel ves--that there should be a royal
commission to investigate the matter and give
it publicity. I am not in favour of royal
commissions as a rule, but in this instance I
think a royal commission would be educative
and do mucli to help the Government to
sponsor a reasonable bill, which would not
be approved by public opinion as it stands
to-day.
For the reasons I have given, I am going
to support the Bill, and I think every honourable member will have to do likewise or be
Hon. Mir. MeRAE.

placed in the position of putting this company
out of business while other companies are
being licensed which charge as much as this
company, or even more.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
last niglît I said all I wanted to say on this
inatter. but there bas come to me as chairman
of the committee a letter which I think may
be enligltening to members of the House. It
is from a company which is lending money in
considerable quantities in the province of
Ontario and is working. I am told, under
provincial charter. The company is fearful
that this Bill may become a model bill for all
companies operating under Dominion charter.
The letter says, in effect: "We desire to call
your attention to the evidence which we
submitted to your committee last year, which
w-as to the effect that we could not do
business at less than 3 per cent a month on
loans up to $100. 22 per cent a month on loans
from $100 to $300, and 2 per cent a month on
loans of $300 and upwards." According to my
nenory those charges are almost exactly the
sane as the charges in the scale of the Russell
Sage Foundation. From this you will sec that
flie rate of interest charged under this Bill
is very much less than the average would beRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is not the
The
average; it is the maximum rate.
average is sure to be lower.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: These rates of 3, 21
and 2 per cent will cost very much more to
the average borrower.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, yes, very
much more.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: It is in the minds of
some of these Dominion companies that the
rate in the Bill is too low. I am net in
favour of 'higher rates at all; I am simply
stating that there is a fear also in the minds of
some provincially chartered companies that
this Bill will set too low a rate of interest.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members, yesterday I had some doubt in my
mind as to the advisability of this legislation.
That doubt has disappeared. The statements
of the two leaders and others who have
spoken to-day have cleared the atmosphere for
me completely. I am sure that every honourable member of the House who has listened
to the discussion so far must be convinced of
the necessity for tihis legislation. If this legislation does not pass, the people who find it
necessary to borrow in this way will be in a
much worse position than they othenvise
wouild. That is the whole thing in a nutshell. We simply must pass this legislation,
and from the discussion that has taken place

MARCH 9, 1937

145

I can see no necessity for our reviewing the
Bill in Committee of the Whole. The principles involved have been threshed out from
A to Z for two sessions, and there is practical
unanimity on the part of those who heard
all the evidence and listened to all the discussion.
There is only one phase of this whole situation with regard to which I still feel a lack
of knowledge, and that is as to the manner
in which these sharks that are talked about
operate. I do not know what happens. My
right honourable leader (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) has referred to the two classes of
borrowers: those who borrow with the security
of an endorser on their note-in whose case
the lender can sue the endorser and, if he
bas any money, recover from him-and those
who borrow with the security of a chattel
mortgage on a physical asset that is worth
something.
That is quite understandable.
But what security has this shark? I am not
at all in favour of sharks, but I should imagine
that if a man cannot get an endorser and bas
no chattels the shark who lends his money
will lose everything.

these small loan companies to operate unless allowed to charge at least 20 per cent
per annum as a regular rate. I was not surprised at evidence given before the Committee on Banking and Commerce that there are
always thousands of people who require a
small sum of money in a hurry, perhaps
within twenty-four hours, and who will pay
almost any rate to get it. Many of these
people do not like to borrow from a friend,
nor do they l.ike to get a friend to endorse
a note for them. They would rather give a
chattel mortgage on furniture or other goods
and in this way keep their loan as secret as
possible. Not by any means all these people
find themselves in financial straits solely because of conditions brought about by the depression of the last seven years.
In the light of the facts, I felt, with the
Superintendent of Insurance, that 2 per cent
a month, 24 per cent a year, was not a seandalous rate. One company which we had
before us was able to make a return of only
slightly over 4 per cent on its invested capital; so evidently there are not very high
profits to be made in the business.

Hon. Mr. DUFF: I think the companies
are the sharks.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The honourable
senator from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder)
asked, as I understood him, what protection
the loan shark had. He bas the protection
afforded him by salaried employees who
dare not face a garnishee for fear of losing
their jobs.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: I should think that
must be the reason for the terrible rates of
interest that are charged.
However, I do
not know anything about that. We are not
concerned at the moment witlh the shark
except for the fact that he will get hold of
people who otherwise would do business with
a company of the class of the one before
us. I think the safest course to follow is to
provide a way of avoiding the shark.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may say that
I made considerable inquiry into this matter.
That was some time ago, but the habits of
the people have not cbanged. I heard of
loan sharks in Montreal who were lending at
a flat rate of 4 per cent a month before
1900. That is what caused me to suggest
we should have a bill against usury. But
they have kept on charging the same rate.
If a note is not paid at maturity they protest
the note and certain notarial fees are added
to the loan. If the amount due is not collectible otherwise, they will sue, and then
the borrower is responsible for law costs.
Aside from these additional costs, I was
scandalized at the rate of 4 per cent a month
and felt it should be stopped. I received
letters by the bushel, giving particulars of
certain cases. Some persons owed two or
three times the amount they had actually
borrowed. But when I started to study the
subject I found it did not seem possible for

Some Hon. SENATORS:

Question!

Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, perhaps I may be allowed a word or
two before the motion is passed. Why cannot this company get a licence? Because it
charges a $10 fee for taking a chattel mortgage. The company keeps that money itself,
instead' of paying it to a solicitor, as it
should do, and the Superintendent of Insurance will not allow that.
I listened to the right honourable leader
on the other side (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
as he gave a perfect summary of the
evidence that was presented before the committee last year. But here is what troubles
me. If I get on a street car in the city of
Winnipeg or the city of Toronto, I see advertisements reading somewhat like this:
"Consult such-and-such a conpany and have
your financial difficulties removed."
If I
take up the Winnipeg Free Press or the Winnipeg Tribune I find' similar advertisements.
These companies aIso send around circulars,
in whieh they say: "Why owe money to the
butcher and the baker? Consult us and we
will consolidate your debts." Now, if the
business is no more profitable than haa

Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is for registration.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: No; the total charges.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Evidence given before
the committee last year by a good many
witnesses was that the average charge was $10,
including disbursements for registration, documents and searches. I do not want to press
for a vote, for, as I say, we have accomplished the object we had in mind for this
sitting. But I submit an obligation rests
squarely on the shoulders of Parliament to
see that this whole question is investigated
with a view to preventing loan sharks from
defying the law which fixes 12 per cent as a
maximum rate. Why does the leader of the
Government
in this House
(Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) say that law cannot be enforced?
Of course it cannot be enforced if we do not
want to enforce it. As long as senators will
sit here and vote to permit companies to
charge 2¾ per cent a month we shall have
loan sharks in this country. I do not believe
the House of Commons will vote for this Bill,
and I hope it will not. And I think that if
we were responsible to the people we would
not vote for it.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Question!
Hon. HENRY A. MULLINS: Honourable
senators, I have listened with some interest
to the discussion on this Bill. A few years
ago a similar bill was brought into the House
of Commons, and I am glad to say it was
killed there. I believe this Bill will meet a
similar fate. After having travelled through
the West and heard what the people think of
these high rates, I find it hard to believe that
this honourable body would support a bill
such as we have now before us.
Why
encourage people to give chattel mortgages
on their furniture and become subject to the
high rates these small loan companies charge?
I came across some poor persons in Winnipeg
who needed some money and were intending
to get it from one of these companies. I said
to them: "Don t do that. Come on down
to the Bank of Commerce." I went down with
them to the bank, where they got the money
for 6 per cent. Almost any reliable man can
get a friend to endorse his note. Why should
we make it easy for people to make themselves liable for rates running from 24 to 35
per cent?
Let me repeat, honourable senators, that I
believe this measure will be killed in the
House of Commons. I should be sorry to
have it known in the West that this honourable body is supporting a measure which
permits such high rates of interest as the
present Bill permits, and I do not want to be
a party to the passage of the Bill.
31117-10J

Some Hon. 'SENATORS: Question!
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question
before the Senate, honourable senators, is on
the amendment to the motion for third reading of Bill C. The amendment is that the
Bill be not now read a third time, but be
referred to the Committee of the Whole
House for further consideration.
Hon. WILLIAM DUFF: Honourable senators, after the great deal of illumination
which we have got from the discussion here
this afternoon I am more than ever convinced that not only this Bill but all similar
bills are absolutely wrong. I say that Parliament-not the Government, but Parliament, which includes the people's representatives in the Senate as well as in the House
of Commons-will not be doing its duty if it
allows loan sharks or companies such as the
one represented in this Bill to charge 27 or
30 per cent interest per annum. Not only
do these companies charge extremely high
rates, but they take security to the extent of
double the value of the loan, or more. A
man who borrows $100 is required to put up
security of $200 or $250, and if the interest
is not paid promptly, or in any way at all
the agreement is not kept, the poor borrower
may have $250 worth of furniture, or his
automobile, or horse and buggy, as the
case may be, seized,. I say that we as members of the Parliament of Canada should not
sit here and, allow such a bill to pass. We
should not permit any company to levy altogether unreasonable rates on a poor man who
is in need of a small sum of money.
There is on the Statute Book a law providing that not more than 12 per cent per
annum may be charged on small loans. I
would go further than my honourable friend
the junior senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Haig) and say that 12 per cent is too high a
limit. One of the Canadian banks arranged
a short time ago to make personal loans, and
it has lent millions of dollars in this way.
Small sums may also be borrowed from private
individuals.
I am surprised to learn what high rates
some companies are able to charge in Toronto,
Montreal and Winnipeg. I happen to own a
few mortgages-not big ones-on which the
rates are around 5 per cent and, at the very
highest, 6 per cent per annum. Down in the
Maritime Provinces the most we can get on
our money is 6 or 7 per cent; we would never
think of charging 12 per cent, let alone 27
per cent, compounded.
It is time for us in the Senate to stop
putting bills like this through and trying to
justify our action by saying that but for the

solvring some of the problems. The droughtstricken area, as I have said, is so vast that
no clear-cut scheme may be available for
general adoption.
My right honourable friend was not here
yesterday, but he has Tepeated what I said
then, namely, that the Hon. Minister of Agriculture is responsible for the work to be
carried on during the next three years. He
suggests his own way of doing it, -and ho will
be answerable for the result. He bas three
years in which to show what progress he can
make in this direction, and I wish him Godspeed.

The only objective of this Bill is te amend
the Act incorporating the Loan and Finance
Corporation so that the company may charge
only that maximum interest of 2 per cent
a month, and instead of charging interest ir
advanice may calculate the amount every
month. Thus the borrower will know exactl.
what he owes the company.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
"blank cheque" too.

On motion of Hon. Mr. MeMeans, Chair
man of the Committee on Divorce, the folk
lowing Bills were severally read the second
time:

Schiller Lightstone.

Jessica Kimpton Shiells.

Doris Newman.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: He bas a limited

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.
PRIVATE BILL-INDUSTRIAL LOAN
AND FINANCE CORPORATION
THIRD READING

Hon. L. MORAUD moved the third reading of Bill H, an Act respecting Industrial
Loan and Finance Corporation.
He said: Honourable senators, this Bill is
an amendiment to the original Act, and is in
accordance with the recommendation which
the Superintendent of Insurance made in
1936. In his report of that year he said:
In the discussion in Parliament on bills
affecting

small

loan

companies

in

1934

the

departuient suggested the substitution, for tc
section of tc
Bill fixing tc
charges, of a
flat inclusive monthly rate of interest uniform
for all loans owhatever tc ainount, with the
further provision that no interest should be
deducted or received in advance or compounded,
but should be charged on the unpaid principal
balances.
While this suggestion was
not adopted, there
was enacted at tc
session of that year an

aimendiuent to the Loan Companies Act, which
provided that any conpany deriving its powers
froum tc Parlianent of Canada which charged
on any loan a rate of interest exceeding 23 per
cent per month on tc monthly balance owing
by the borrower, should be liable to have its
charter forfeited or its powers terninated by
action of tc Governor in Council.
The Superintendent
of Insurance
also
stated:
Revised bills should provide for an inclusive
monthly rate, not deducted in advance, but
charged on nonthly balances of principal owing.
The departnent believes that a nonthly rate
of 2 per cent will enable the companies to
operate at a reasonable profit after a fair
volume of loans bas been made.

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.

MARCH 10, 1937
Government's publications do not pay the
interest on their cost. They are not even
always in demand, and when they are received, they usually are left a prey to dust.
If you think that I exaggerate, visit carefully
our libraries, even those of our schools, and
you will soon be enligitened. If you go
tbrough the handbooks of our primary schools,
and, even our universities, you will notice that
mineralogy is studied only from a theoretical
standpoint: classification, identification, physical properties of minerals, here and there a
word to explain that such mineral exists in
snch or such a district. Evidently, it is not
enough. It is true that a teacher may
supplement it with a verbal course. But does
he do it? Out of curiosity I inquired from
a great many university and classical college
graduates, and. my impression is that, especially in our French-speaking schools, tfie
mineral resources of Canada are not sufficiently shown.
Rev. Father Fontanel spoke about the
awakening of the people. "May it develop and
endure!" said he. Unfortunately this awakening
resulted immediately in a wild and frantie race
to the mining exchange and, consequently, a
loss of millions in small savings. I wonder
whether Rev. Father Fontanel's appreciation
of the Government's efforts is not slightly
beside the mark. Yes, there are many departmental publications, but without any great
effort being made in that regard, or without
any clear purpose from the educational and
practical standpoint.
Instead of the people's savings being directed
towards industries based on our natural resources, and soundly organized by competent
men, and with all the necessary protection on
the part of the Government, they were left
at the mercy of unlimited speculation. For
instance, if the province of Quebec had been
led along these lines, French Canadians would
not have to complain about being deprived
of their heritage, betrayed, and forsaken for
the benefit of foreign firms.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. SAUVE: They would be less
inclined to criticize the Constitution and
Confederation to justify their position, because that position would not be what they
claim it is. They would have a certain influence among the ruling class, in matters of
interest to the mind and of paramount import throughout the world.
Through sensible co-ordination of their efforts, and by organizing, without undue ambition or prejudice, their savings for well defined
purposes of co-operative production, they
would rule where they are now resenting their
status of dependence.

153

Nowadays, economic activity ranks before
all other factors and truly dominates the social
world. Economists and historians have ascertained the fact that it brings its demands
to bear upon political, civil and religious
institutions, which have to reckon with it. It
also controls international politics.
It is a fact that an insufficient knowledge
of our Canadian homeland and of its possibilities has upset some quite commendable
schemes in this country. It has led to wrong
steps being taken. It has been a source of
mistaken ideas, losses, indifference, pessimism
and confusion, which make more and more
difficult the task of those whose duty it is
to govern.
Training in the study of statistics is stil'
quite inadequate in this country. I am referring especially to my native province, with
which I am better acquainted than with the
others. Inadequate, if not practically nonexistent. The Canada Year Book and the
Annuaire Statistique de Québec are unknown
even among the majority of intellectuals,
teachers, young members of the professional
classes, or young people who have taken up
commercial and industrial careers. They all
know the number of moving picture theatres
and clubs in Montreal, but they cannot tell
what Canada's production amounted to five
years ago, or last year. They even know
nothing about the production of their own
The Department of Trade and
province.
Commerce publishes every year a fine pamphlet entitled " Canada," a small handbook
which ought to be in the hands of all Canadians who wish to know their country well. Why
should not this summary, as well as the two
year books already mentioned, be found in
every school, in every educational institution?
I am especially referring to my own province,
because I do not know whether they are
available or not in other provinces.
Snch a lack of knowledge has kept us too
much unacquainted with ithe scientific aspect
of our natural resources, while outside investors
were carefulýly surveying them through their
geologists, engineers and prospectors. If we
leave out some rather exaggerated claims that
appear in it, the pamphlet issued by Hon.
Mr. Crerar, which is full of accurate data,
should be distributed for educational purposes
to all our schools. The object of the instruction
should be, not to develop a taste for adventure
and speculation, nor to train gamblers, much
less to turn our men and women into dabblers
on the stock exchange, but to make our -country
better loved and accurately known, to give
confidence to her young people and to convince them they are justified in being proudly
devoted to her and in expecting that in return

SENATE
for initiative, work and concentration she will
yield the greatest benefits.
It is a matter of regret that we have flot
been earnest enough in asseeiating the study
of our ýland with the examiniation of our
distress.ing national and economie problems.
While it is truc that, tbirougb Louis Hébert,
the apothecary-herbalist fromi Paris who was
the flrst man to settie at Stadacena (Quebec),
Frenchi Canaýdians were the initiators of
botany in America, i.t is also truc, nevertheIess. that we have been greatly outdistaneed
by the Arnericans, as well as by the British
financial barons, in the development of our
own resorces. Io that respect these people
have enormeusly benefltcd through oor unwarrantable tolerance and our unpardonable
apathy. We should not blarne those who,
through their great endeavours and the heavy
risks tbey were willing to takýe, have set an
example for us.

a country is unable to ensure the necessary
welfare to two million homes?
With a population of less than eleven
millions, with a national wealth estimated at
no less than twenty-five billions of dollars;
with a net production of about three billions;
the fact that this is but an insignificant part
of our extensive potential resources; the fact
that in the 15 per cent of our territory
suitable for cultivation we have more than
189 million acres of farm lands still undeveloped, apart from the Yukon Territory
and the 9 million acres of the Northwest
Territories; with forests producing yearly
about $200,000,000 worth of wealth, and
fisheries whose annual output is worth
$50,000,000 and will no doubt increase in value
under the progressive leadership planned in
Quebec and elsewhere; with reasonable prospects of untold wealth in the country"s subsoil, which. although as yet merely scratched in
places, yields over $300,000,000 a year, that
is, $1,000,000 for each working day, and an
increase of more than 800 per cent in onethird of a century; with that population of
scarcely eleven millions ranking, as it does,
among the five greatest exporting countries;
with human assets more wisely distributed
and botter protected, after having increased
in value through a sound education-with
all this, I ask with pride, should not Canada
be optimistic rather than pessimistic?
Lot us not forget that our forests cover an
area of about 1,130,000 square miles, and that
their development is the third among our
primary industries. I venture to say that
if their development had proceeded along
better lines, with botter forest classification
and protection, they would yield not merely

400,000 men. It would give work to 500,000
people if machinery had not displaced human
labour to such an undue extent. Nowadays,
it uses from 25,000 to 30,000 horses, instead of
100,000, owing to the introduction of motor
vehicles and tractors.
If at the same time we consider the freshwater area of Canada, estimated at more
than 228,000 square miles, the largest in the
world, and according to a report of federal
departmental engineers, representing at least
44,000,000 horse-power, only 20 per cent of
which is developed at the present time-I
say that if we consider these splendid marvels
of our huge hydro-electric resources, are we

155

not justified in being proud of our country
and expecting therefrom an unbounded prosperity? These resources constitute also an
element of utmost importance in the development of our mines.
Our national territory covers nearly the
northern half of the American continent; it
extends over an area of 3,684,723 square miles.
The Dominion of Canada is as large as Eturope
and is thirty times as large as the British
Isles. Our country represents more than 27
per cent of the total area of the British
Empire.
Forward! Such is the advice given to the
young men of Canada. Within ten years,
under discerning guidance and management,
our wealth will be at least $30,000,000,000,
and our yearly production will reach approximately $5,000,000,000. Our rich mining empire is being estaiblished in the 85 per cent

metals most needed in the world are nickel,
copper, zinc and lead. Canada already produces them in such quantities that, undoubtedly, certain nations, eager for conquest, have
their eyes on these resources. Also, the Gaspé,
Chibougamau and Ungava districts, in the province of Quebec, as well as the rich fields
of the Abitibi, of Temiskaming, etc., would
make the least ambitious countries pine away
with envy. What about asbestos in the Eastern Townships, which makes Canada the leading producing nation in the world? This
matter will probably call for more consideration in the future than we seem to have
given up till now. What about our gold that
is so abundant and so promising? Financiers
and capitalists who wish to make investments
covet these natural resources before the nation
has had an opportunity to share in the profits
derived therefrom.
Our mining industry dates back only ton
years, so to speak. It is only since 1932 that
its development has been really important.
Nevertheless, the mining industry prevented
us from falling into the gulf of depression. It
kept bankruptcy away.
According to the Dominion Bureau of
Statisties, our 11,652 mines and plants (oil
and gas wells, sand and gravel pits included)
paid $88,000,000 in salaries and wages to 73,000
workers last year.
In 1930, before the dark days of depression,
31,000 workers, with a payroll amounting to
$49,000,000, were employed in our mines.
This means that during the worst period of
the depression, 1932-34, when defeatists were
harassing governments, mining development
was responsible for an increase in labour to
the extent of 42,000 men, and in wages
amounting to $39,000,000.

securities offered by pirates from the Stock
Exchange and other promoters.
Amid these facts, figures, swindles, losses,
and ruins. there stands a monument on whose
pedestal may be read the commandments of
wisdom. Let us find in them a lesson for the
present and the future.
Governmental authorities are well advised in
planning further to take firm and efficient
action against unscrupulous brokers so as to
protect the honest people. net only of the
country, but also of the Stock Exchange.
I an informed that there still exists a combine which has the appearance of keen conpetition between Montreal and Toronto. The
same stock would seern to command a different price on the Montreal and the Toronto
exchanges. Why this difference? Why pay
$5 for a share in Montreal when it can sell
at only $4.75 and $4.50 in Toronto? It seems
that this trick deceives a large number of
people.
Fo-rgers, mining stocks swindlers and trusts
are to-day the real enemies against whom
public grievances are increasing, such grievances being also voiced against those who
protect them in governrments and parliaments.
Just as it is necessary and fair to afford protection to the honest broker, who is a trained
adviser in commercial co-operation for the
development of our public utilities, so at the
same time it becomes urgent to take action
against the thief who stands on the doorsteps
of the Stock Exchange, in quest of victims.
It is aiso urgent to warn and protect the
public against their worst agent-the man
who dstributes fallacious and misleading
prospectuses. Do we realize the harrn donc
by this publicity? People do not seem to
ponder over the abuse, the result and the
harm donc by this fallacious, misleading and
dishonest publicity. It has a cruel and subversive influence upon the education and conduct of the people. The community cannot
rely only upon governments. What is the
élite doing to remedy this condition? The
élite of the press? The élite of society?
A far too great number will protest weakly
They will
against the speculation mania.
voice indolently their fear at the progress

They will say that it is the
propaganda.
scum of intelligence and talent that finds its
way into certain publications. But the real
élite, those whom we should respectfully consider as the real social authority, what are
they doing? They do not venture to answer
the charges made against them, or answer
the evolution propagandists who are forging
their way towards revolution. They are afraid

to be caught in the net. They are afraid to
attack. They are afraid to put a stop to the
outbursts.
In that way we are deprived of the guidance
which is so important. Thus the people are
at the mercy of all kinds of vile speculators.
That is why the destitute no longer kneel
down. They stand up in order to strike any
kind of blow, above or below the belt. They
are desperate. Instead of slighting them, we
should administer purgatives and tonics.
Capitalistic combines are responsible-really

is the time to realize this fact.
The Hon. Mr. Gagnon, the new Minister
of Mines in the Quebec Government, has
just given a proof of his sense of duty and
his patriotism in giving to his fellow-citizens
this very wise warning: "Very rigid legislation," says the Minister, "will be passed at the
next session in order to protect the public
and the mine owners." In the meantime people
should refrain from investing their money
on the strength of mere rumors, and should
remember that mines are divided into three
classes: mines that are in operation and pay
regular dividends; mines that are in operation
and pay no dividends; and finally prospects,
which themselves are divided into two groupsprospects on which extensive research work
is being done, and those which are in the
early stages of prospecting. In conclusion
the Minister says that the same care should
be exercised when buying mining stocks as
when buying industrial stocks. and be expresses hope for a "prosperity free from any
unjustified increase on the mining stock market."
Goveroments who protect public savings
against mad and criminal speculation practise
a wise and proper economy. Their task is
not an easy one. They safeguard the people's
money for investment in profitable undertakings and national enterprises.
Our new enthusiasm might still prove fatal
if our governments had. not already taken
more fully than in the past and were net
now taking the necessary steps to find out
scientifically the value of the mines, so as to
ensure rational development and an honest
sale of stocks to the public.
Mr. Phelan, president of the Financial
Service, also remarks, very sensibly:
It is, however, also important to reinember
tha-t in advising people to guard against highpressure salesmen, one must not lose sight of
the fact that there are very many worthy
enterprises, as in the case of various mines,
where the speculative element is naturally

MARCH 10, 1037
Development of our mining industry will
create new centres of colon-ization. We should
take stops to provide for their needs. How
can we do it? In trying to get the elements
of a population imbued with Christian principles, respectful of our institutions and of
order, and having the necessary ability and
training for the work they will have to perform. " Mens sana in corpore sano." These
miling and adjoining centres need strong and
healthy men to work in the bowels of the
earth or to clear the land. The House knows
that very severe legisiation and rules apply
already to mine owners and their employees;
or at least they are supposed -to apply to
them. There is legisiation to that effect, but
the manner in whieh it is applied as inefficient in many a case. Preventive methods
are certainly less numerous than the 1'aws
which recommend or prescribe them. Death
is taking an awful toll in this country. Our
deat-h rate is stili very high. Nearly 6,000
people die each year fro'm tuberculosis. Six
of the mast common diseases are responsible
for only one-sixth of the numnber of people
who die from tuberculosis. Medical and governmental authorities have long been concerned about tuberculosis among the miners.
Tubereulosis microbes develop very rapidly
in the -mines. Steps should be taken to prevent 'their intrusion or to free the mines of
them. As aur Canadian mining industry is
in its primlary stage, our legisiators should
look carefully into that matter. Some people
always advise against going too f ast, but
neither must we wait too long.
Development of the Canadian mining industry bas made very good progreas during
the depression. It has saved us from bankruptcy. It has been a big help for the CanaTowns were built overdian Government.
night. Sudbury, for instance, already supplies
86 per cent of the nickel used in the whole
world. That district has a young population
of 50,000, încluding about 40,000 miners, 4,000
business men or skilled labourers, and 6,000
farmers. About 50,000 acres have been cleared
and 30,000 acres are under cultivation. There
are also quite a number of cattle, in spite of
the poor condition of the soul that can be
cultivated-9,OO head of cattie, including
4,000 dairy cows. The reason is that our
mining districts are generally suitable for
agricultural purpases and provide a profitable local market for intensive f arming or
for produets which can be grown in large
quantities in smali areas. In these districts
milk, butter and cheese are high-priced
products.
A peaceful population, respectfîîl of our
Creator, of nur faith, of our institutions and
of our laws-that is what we should aim to
have.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Imperialist?
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: We shaîl see. I do not
wish to tire the imagination of my honourable friend.
Our mining centres must not be allowed to
become the seat of operations of enemiýes of
our country and readily accessible to agents of
revolution and to spies.
We are said to be at peace wîth the whole
world. Are we quite sure of that? I do not

lead, and so on-been at the moot of ail wars
of conquest? It bas recently been recalled that
Rame and Carthage waged war for the possession of the silver lead of Carthagena. Why
did the Spanish conquistadores invade Mexico
and Peru? To seek El Dorado. The English
wantcd to cantrol the gold of the Transvaal,
just as Germany wanted the iron of Lorraine
and other sources of wealth.
When the United States saw gald in our
Alaska, they claimed possession of that territory. I{ad England not given it ta them,
wauld they nat have wished ta take it just the
saine? " Remember the Maine."~ Did not the
United States take Mexican California when
they thought it cantained an abundance of
gald? During the last war, did nat nickel
mnatte, s0 extensively used in armam-ent construction, stimulate in the United States an
ambition which was rather disquieting for us
and for England? Sa dubiaus was the United
States' attitude that an inquiry was instituted
and canducted by the Rayai Ontaria Nickel
Commission.
The years 1915 ta 1917 braught forth revelatians. Abuses ta the detriment of Canada
were discovered. Germany was getting aur
nickel which had beýen shipped ta the United

States for refining.
submarines coming ta Baltimore ta laad up
with nickel. Thanks ta the attitude of Canada, the "International" decided ta erect a
large refinery an the narth shore of Lake
Erie, at Port Caîbarne. As was sa well shawn
by Mr. Benait Brouillette, profesar at the
Schoal far Highcr Cammercial
Mantreal
Studies, this attitude af the American financiers
was 50 dangerous that English capitalists, aided
by the Imperial Gavernm-ent, faunded the
British American Nickel Corparatian in order
ta carry on electrolytie refining in Canada.
Unsuccessful there, the company built a concentratian plant at Nickelton and a refinery
at Deschènes.
But it was English capital, aided by the
Imperial Gavernment. which, by the canstruction of refneries in Canada, diverted aur
nickel from the United States. This is an
examiple that should teach us better ta canserve
and develop, ourselves, the land of aur
forefathers.

'Mr. S~AUVE

MARCH 10, 1937
They have understood that the observations
I have made may prove useful to many fellowcitizens and even to foreigners.
If I have spoken particularly for my own
province, it is because I knew that its sisters
had ini ti:s Chamber repre&entatives more
qualified than I arn to interpret their interests. May the song of each one of them be a
couplet of the Canadian soul, and may they
ail be the sincere expression of our Canadian
pride. of our love of justice, of our respect
for authority and of our enthusiastic hope
for the future. In the exaltation of bis ardent
patriotism aud with bis vision of wide and
far horizons, George Etienne Cartier exclaimed: "Let us take possession of the soil 1"
It is for us now to say: "Let us take possession of the subsoil!"
Hon. Mr. PAQUET: I move the adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: Arn I to understand that
the quotations to wbich I referred, but wbich
I did not read, will be placed on Hansard?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, yes. I did
not know the extent of the documents the
honourable gentleman wished to place on
Hansard. I see that they are not numerous.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Paquet, the debate
was adjourned.
DIVORCE BILLS
THIRD READINGS

I notice in the list of documents No. 142,
the report of the Royal Commission on
Anthracite Coal. For some weeks I have bad
a printed copy of that report; as I have had
aIso of No. 143, the report of the Conciliation
Board on the railway wage dispute. Cuild
the chairman of the committce inform the
buse whether any other of the items have
alresdy been printed?
Hon. Mr. WHITE: Honourable senators,
the committee went over this list item by
item yesterday, and the secretary was supposed to inform us what reports had already
been printed. Possibly, as my honourable
friend bas said, one or two items in the list
have already been printed and distributed,
and their inclusion is no doubt due to an
oversight. I might say that some discussion
wvith regard te one or two items necessitated
a division, 'but the majority ruled that none
contained in the report should be printed.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Take No. 38, list
of shareholders of the Bank of Canada. I
should like to have a copy of that list, but
I arn almost asbamed to ask for it to be
typewritten, for I1 know the labour and cost
involved. I amn wondering wbetber a considerable number of members of the Senate

to have a copy. I amn aIl for the saving of

Hon. Mr. WHITE: My honourable friend

Hon. Mr. WHITE: If any honourable

If I lad been present I should have insisted
on the printing of Dr. Tory's report in the

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:

It is printed.

Hon. Mr. PARENT: The report may be
all in favour of those attacked, or it may be
the other way, but it is an education in itself.
I should like it to be understood that we
ought also to have copies in the French

BUSINESS OF THE SENATEADJOURNMENT
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, we have an imiportant Bill before
us, but we cannot take it up to-morrow. The
Railway Com'mittee has made many amendments, and the Bill will have to be reprinted.
We expect to have it in its amended form
next week, when we hope to dispose of the
measure. I have made inquiries and find
that no legislation is likely to reach us from
the Commons next week. I shall move that
when the Senate adjourns this afternoon
it stand adjourned until Tuesday evening
at 8 o'clock. I am quite clear in my mind
that by Thursday evening next we shall be
able to adjourn for Holy Week, and honourable members of the Senate will be able to
attend to their Easter duties at home.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Before the motion to
adjourn is put, may I say that this afternoon
I was quite agreeable to the postponement of
my remarks on the motion of the honourable
senator from Alma (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne),
but I should like to have the adjourned
motion placed first on the Order Paper for
Tuesday next, so that I can get along with
what I have to say. I -have waited patiently
for a whole week, and do not want to be delayed again next week.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Go ahead now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think I can
assure my honourable friend that there will
be a field day on naval matters. I hope the
discussion will be limited to the naval matters
raised by the honourable senator from Aima
(Hon. Mt. Ballantyne) and will not extend to
maritime rights.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I suppose that if we
want to disouss the Transport Bill at length
we shall not have to adjourn on Thursday
next.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I hope that
by sitting occasionally in the evening we
may succeed in disposing of both matters.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: May I ask the
leader of the House if he proposes to accept
the suggestion of the honourable senator
from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duff) to place
the order for the adjourned debate on naval
matters first on the Order Paper?
Hon. Mr. DUFF: That ought to be done.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Put it on
first.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
That would
imply that we are to spend Tuesday evening
on naval matters. All right. I agree to that,
so that on Wednesday we may be able to
discuss the Transport Bill.
I move that when the Senate adjourns this
evening it do stand adjourned until Tuesday evening next at 8 o'clock.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, March

FARMERS' CREDITORS
ARRANGEMENT ACT
ANSWER

TO

INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I desire to lay
on the Table a return in answer to the inquiry of the honourable senator from Cardigan (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) relating to the
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: .Honourable senators,
this is an important matter, and I ask permission of the House to say just a few words with
regard to it. This return. which is in answer
to a number of questions asked by the honourable senator from Cardigan (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald), who is ill, brings out seme startling things with respect te the cost of administering the Act.
Hon. _.Mr. DANDURAND: I should like to
suggest to ny honourable friend that he bring
this matter before the Senate in the regular
way. I am not informed as to what the
strictures of my honourable friend will be,
and I mia
be unable to answer them. A
return has been laid upon the Table. I do
net believe that such a procedure permits of
My honourable friend can
any discussion.
bring this matter to the attention of the
Senate in the regular way, upon a day to be
named; then we shall be informed of the
matter which is to come before us.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Is not the
situation this? It is truc that something has
been laid upon the Table, but it has been
donc in pursuance of a notice of the honourable
senator froin Prince (Hon. Mr. MacArthur).
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

No, no.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: It was in response to
a question asked by the honourable senator

from Cardigan (Hon. Mr. Macdonald).
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The name
does net matter. Without any doubt, the
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act comes
within the notice given Pby the honourable
senator from Prince (Hon. Mr. MacArthur),
which has been called.
Hon. Mr. HARDY:
iniry.

There

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: What I was going to
say requires no answer. What I was about
to ask for is for the information of the Senate,
and I wish to get the matter before as many
members as possible, so that they may be
prepared to discuss it when the time comes.
If there are only one or two copies of the
return available, honourable senators will not
have an opportunity of seeing the information that has been laid upon the Table. If
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

the inquiry were answered in the usuai way
the information would be published in the
Debates of the Senate. All I wish to do is
to make certain that this information will
come before the House. We are near the
end of the session. I am satisfied that honourable senators would like te have the information. The discussion that would ensue would
be valuable. I think, to this House, to Parliament, .to the Government and to the country.
All I ask is that a sufficient number of copies
of the information be made available te
honourable senators who may wish to sec it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I am quite certain that I was right.
It may be that the return laid on the Table
pertains te sene questions asked by the
honourable senator from Cardigan (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald), but I distinctly heard the notice
of .the honourable senator from Prince (Hon.
Mr. MacArthur) called from the Chair.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

It was allowed

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I know that
someone said "stand," but I do not think the
Chair decided that it should stand.
This
notice deals withi the subject of the Farmers'
Creditors Arrangement Act, and the fact that
the honourable senator who sponsors it is
net here does net preclude some other member from speaking on the subject.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Something else

Right Hou. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do net see
how it could.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

I rose and pre-

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But we have
to follow the order of procedure, and the
last notice before the Orders of the Day is
No. 4. There cannot be anything between
that notice and the Orders of the Day; so
if anybody is in order it is the honourable
member from King's (Hon. Mr. Hughes). I

know the subject-matter he refers to, and in
support of what he said I want to add that
I have information from the Island-although
I live a long way from there-as to really
shocking expenses in the administration of
the Act in the Island, and almost unbelievable
appointments; one, for example, of a man
whose record at the Bar is certainly challenged. I have this information from a source
that one simply cannot doubt, and if the
honourable gentleman would place the return
in the Report of the Debates of the House he
would be doing a service.

MARCH 1.6, 1937
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Can we secure a
sufficient number of copies to afford honourable members of the Senate who may be interested an opportunity of securing the information? Can we do that?

We are ail indebted to the honourabie gentleman fromn Aima (Hon. Mr. Baliantyne),
svho raised this question and afforded us an
opportcnity nf discussing the matter. In the
course cf bis remarks he spoke with the
authority of one who had beon the Minister
in charge of a great department when these
events teok place. and 1 amn sure we were ail
impressed by the strength of the argument
he put ferward.
I propose te take advantage of the opportunity afforded me to taise the generai question of the defenco of our country. and to
considor the obligations resting upon us and
the manner in which they have been discharged.
Our obligations, apart from those imposed
upon us by the naturai duty of defending our
country, are te be focnd in the reports of the
Imperiai Conferences which have been heid
fromn timo te time. 1 read now, fremn page

as given by the Prime Minister in the ether

Rivera, Montreal and other ports. For the
protection of those two harbours and the
entrance to the Gulf we shall have only one
destroyer, for normally one will be in harbour
when the other is at sea.
If you look at a map you will find, that
the distance between the focus of trade for
the harbour of Saint John and the focus of
trade for the St. Lawrence river is a good
700 miles. Apart from the difficulty of one
destroyer trying to cover that territory at all,
there is the fact that it will be armed, as all
destroyers are, with 4-7-inch guns. That is a
very good gun, but it is not a match for a sixinch gun. In the event of a war the result
would be that if an armed nmerchantman
carrying six-inch guns, or a cruiser so armed,
took up its position anywhere on our coastline for the purpose of menacing any one of
the foci of trade that I have mentioned, our
lone destroyer would be blown up out of the
water. Apart altogether from the question of
sending our young men out to confront a
.situation of that kind is the fact that their
efforts would be wholly in vain. After blowing Up our one destroyer an enemy ship
could proceed unhampered to sink incoming
and outgoing vessels.
At the Imperial Conferences of 1923, and
1926 we specifically agreed to protect our trade
and the foci of trade centering on these points.
Underlying the agreement was the idea that
in time of war British ship,- could come
safely to these, harbours and inýo the Gulf of
St. Lawrence, load th.eîr cargoes and take
thema to England, probably under convoy.
As a result of our failure to afford any protection at all worthy of the namne for our
Atlantic harbours, if our trade is to get to
Great Britain at ail in time of war the duty
of protecting our harbours and coast-hine and
of convoyiog our exports to Great Britain will
faîl upon the British Navy. That is to say,
it will have to perform a duty which we have
solemnly agreed to do ourselves. In 1934 I
d'iscussed this very question, and in the saine
session 1 discussed the question of maintenance of our neutrality, particularly on the
Pacific coast. In passing I will just mention
that not only are we bound to protect our
harbours and coast-line, but by our obligations
to the eomity of nations we are bound to
maintain neutrality in the event of a war in
which we are not part5icipating. We are unable
to maintain our neutrality, I submit.
Let me deal particularly for a f ew moments
with the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the St.
Lawrence river. The river provides a waterway into the very heart of this continent, a
waterway which is navigable for ocean ships
up to Montreal. Honourable senators are
familiar with the geography. The opening of

169

the Gulf extends from the south tip of Newfoundland to the northern coast of Nova
Scotia. That is practioally open sea there,
but stili it is the beginning of the Gulf. Now,
in the avent of war an enemy airpiane carrier
might arrive in the Gulf with a load of planes.
There are some eight airpiane carriers in the
British Navy, prohably the saine number in
the Arnerican Navy, and a certain number in
the navies of other great powers. These
ships, according to their size, carry from 50 to
150 planes specially designed for bombing,
fighting, scouting and so on. The ships have
special equipment for catapulting the planes
and for receîving them back on board. If.
at the outbreak of a war our naval defence
were the saine as it is now, it would be
possible for an enemy airplane carrier to corne
up the St. Lawrence river and anchor off the
city of Quebec. It could make the trip up
from .the Gulf in about a day and a haîf.
Anchored there in absolute safety, it could
destroy the city of Que.hec and release bombing planes for the destruction of other cities.
If you look at a map you will sec that the
distance froin Quebec to Toronto by air is
only about 500 miles, and from Quebec to
Montreal it is 200 miles or less. Planes
released from an airplane carrier in the
neighbourhood of Quebec city could bomb
Three Rivera, Montreal and Ottawa successfully, hecause we have nothing to stop
them. We have not a single anti-aircraft
gun in Canada, nor protection of any kind
against enemy planes. In a matter of a couple
of hours after the planes had left the shipduring which. time the city of Quebec itseîf
would have been subjected to heavy shell fire
-they could bomb the three cities I have
mentioned and get back to their ship, which
could immediately pull up anchor and would
reach open sea again within another day and a
haîf. There is nothing to preve nt that. In the
Gulf of St. Lawrence we have no provision
for mines; we have no batteries in position;
we have ahsolutely nothing to prevent an
airplane carrier from coming Up the St. Lawrence and u8ing Quebec harbour as a base.
Ordinarily in time of war an airplane carrier
would not put to sea without an adequate
escort of battleships and cruisers, but in
making an attack on us no such escort would
be necessary, because we have no means of
protecting ourselves at aIl-no mines, no
batteries in position, no wireless stations, no
anti-aircraft guns, and no trained crews, even
if we did have such guns-in short, absolutely
no means of defence against this form of
attack. Operations against us would not be
even an adventure for the crew of an airplane
carrier.

sca-borur trade-I have excluded our land

trade altogether-amounted te $1,737,582,000
in imports, and $3,026.011,000 in experts: a
total sea-borne trade in those five years of

That enermous trade was on

question and provide immediately for the
defence of our harbours and oiur coasts, in
order that we may be in a postition to export
our produce to Great Britain in time of war.
If we fail to do that, if for -any reason this
enormous sea-borne trade is blocked or
stopped, this country, and in particular the
West, will be ruined. During the past f ew
years we in the West have had experience of
what results when priýces faîl very low. What
would happen to, the West if the whole of our
grain production had to be stored in elevators
or along railway sidings?
I think we should go further than proteetWe
ing our own harbours and coast-lines.
8hould provide ourselves with a sufficient
fleet actually to convoy our wheat and other
food stuifs to the British Isies. 1 think we
owe that to ourselves if we are to maintain
Our dignity and our self-respect.
If we do not do that, then we have to
face another situation altogether. The Argentine Republie trad-es naturally with Great
Britain. I say naturally, because it has no
manufacturing industries and is able to dispose of the whole of its export trade, which
i.s grain and beef, and take in payment therefor mnanufaetured goods. My attention bas
been drawn to that by many incidents, and
a few years ago I examined the composition of
the fleet of the Argentine Republic. I find
that it bas provided itself with a defensive
fleet, consisting of coast-defence battleships,
suhmarines. airplanes and river steamers and

the like, but in addition a fleet designed for
convoy duty. I make this prediction. In the

have in Great Britain for these very products,
and which hast year amounted to $523,000,000
odd, will be taken over by the Argentine Riepublie.
As I have said, we enjoy this trade under
preferential agreemente. We have asked Great

Britain to take certain chances under these
agreements. We have said plainhy, "We know
that in favouring our agricultural production
some harm is being doue to British agriculture,
and we are sending our production to supplement your own."
It is true that this trade agreement and
those that preceded it were not negotiated on
the basis of war.

But I submit that they were

not negotiated on the basis that if there
should be an outbreak of war we shouhd leave
the Empire or place ouriselves in the position
of being unable to carry out our implied under-

taking.

There bas been some discussion throughout
the country as to what our position would be
in the event of war in which Great Britain
was involved. It bas been urged that we
should declare our neutrality. That question
bas been discussed in another place, and striking statements have been made by some of
The honourable
our leading public men.
Minister of Justice is reported at page 599 of
the Commons Hansard as follows:
But neutrality is quite different. In the
constitutional position of Canada to-day neutrality would mean that an enemy of Our King
could be a friend of Canada; that we cOUId

King might bce ngaged; that to nations, with

On the same subi ect of neutrality the honourable Secretary of State is reported at page
609 of the Commons Hansard as follows:
Just for the whimsical1 caprice of saying it,
and for no good reason at ail, we are saying to
Great Britain, "It does not matter wlhat
happens; it does not matter in what war you
may be engaged; At does not matter if you are
on the brink of defeat and destruction, we are

Britisher to hold with such language on the
subject.
I have read these two extracts because so
many persons speak lightly of our adopting an
attitude of neutrality in the event of Great
Britain being at war.
Perhaps I mighit sketch the actual procedure of a declaration of neutrality. Let us
assume an outbreak of war between Great
Britain and some other country. On the very
same day our Government must make a
decision. It cannot be left to Parliament, for
Parliament may not be sîtting. But suppose
the Government decides that Canada shall be
neutral until Parliament can be called together. It is not possible under international
law for a country to delay its proclamation
of neutrality. It must do something on the
v'ery day that war is declared.

Supposing nothing

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Thon we must
be ready to resist attaek. 1 submit that if
nothing is doue on that day, our position is

in the war or out, and the determination of
our position rests with the enemy. But assume

national agreements of one sort and another.
I diraw the attention of honourable members
to these points. If we are to be neutral. we
must continue to trade with the -King's
enemies an equal terms. That is to say, if on
the second or third or fourth day of the
month an enemy merchant ship and a British
merchant ship enter the harbour of Halifax
or Saint John for the purpose of taking on
cargo, we will say. of nickel. asbestos, copper,
rubber, and Sa forth. aur Government must
sec te, it that we treat bath those sbips
equally. Under a policy of neutrality, if we
give one ship a cargo we must give the other
one also; otherwise we are not neutral. Then
we must onforce the rides of neutrality
equally against Britisýh and other warships.
Suppose a British warship of inferior strength
takes refuge in the harbouir of H'alifax, and a
bolligerent warship af superior strength is
waiting outside. At the end of twenty-four
hours we must drive that British warship out
ta sea ta almost certain destruction. That is
international law on the subject ai neutrality.
Then we must provide iliat no anc shaîl leave
this country for the purpose of enlisting in
the forces af the King in his right as king
of Great Britain; and probably aur recently
introduced Forcign Enlistment Bill will be
invokod for the purpase. Those are same of
the incidents of international law.

diate. What, I wonder, would be the condition
of Europe to-day if Britain had flot endeavoured, as she has at every moment, to avert or
circumscribe conflict? She haà been the great
pacifier. If at the moment the Spanish civil
war bas flot _grown to proportions involving
the whole of Europe, and possibly other parts
of the world as well, too much credit cannot
be given to Britain. We shall do wela to keep
this thought in mind as we discuss our relations
with the British Empire.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: flear, hear.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That is the statement of the Prime

Minister-I shall corne

back to it in a moment-and 1 draw your
attention to the concluding words of the Prime
Minister's epitomne of the Imperial Conferences
of 1923 and 1926, which I read at the outset:
"until support cornes from the outside."
Now, where do we expect support to corne
from? Of course we expect it to corne frorn
Great Britain herseif. In the debates which
took place wîth respect to the rearmamnent
vote in the British flouse of Commons, the
vote involving seven and a haîf billions of
dollars, the whole discussion concerned the
defence of Great Britain and the Empire. Yet,
when we corne to the disoeission in our own
flouse, notwithstanding the speech which I
quoted a moment ago we find quite a different
attitude. 1 want to read what the Prime
Minister says at page 271 of Hansard.
But I do wish to say at once that, as far as
the estimates presented to Parliament at this
seasion are concerned, any increase placed there
has been only and solely because of what the
Gokvernment believe to be necessary for the

defence of Canada, and for Canada alone. The
eptimates have not been framed with any

thought of participation in European wars.
'They have not been framed as a result of any
combined effort or consultation with the British
authoritias.

I want to contrast the attitude taken by the
British Commons when they discussed the
rearmamnent vote of seven and a haîf billion
dollars "'for the defence of the British
Ernpire"ý-thereby showing their willingness
to help us-with the attitude of our Prime
Minister that we -are to hold out "«until support cornes frorn the outside," and the debate
in our own flouse of Commons wherein it was
urged that the vote was for the defence of
Canada alone. I would point out the fact
that throughout the whole of that debate,
which lasted a week, there was not a word
said by any member on either side of the
flouse which raised the question of our
obligation for Imperial defence, or any suggestion of co-operation in Imperial defence.
That is a very important thing to rernember,
because there is going to be an Imperial
Conference thîs year, which will be attended

by delegates frorn Canada, and we are told
that the first item of business. and the

greatest item of discussion, will be I-mperial
defence. I want to raise the question now,
and, in view of what I have read, I want to
get an answer from the Government, if I can,
as to just where we stand with respect to the
Imperial Conference. Because the flouse of
Commons of Canada passed the recent defence
estiinates upon the assurance of the Prime
Minister that they were for the defence of
Canada alone, is it to be assurned that there
were no European entanglernents nor Empire
commitments? Or because there was not a
word raising the question of collective security
or of co-operation within the Empire, is it to
be assumed that the Government of this
country has a mandate to go to the Imperial
Con-ference and refuse ahl forme of co-operation? That is the view taken by somne people.
I have here an article on national defence,
published in the Globe and Mail of February
24 last, sent frorn Ottawa by William
Marchington, which concludes by saying:
One thing the debate of the past few days
bas done: it has forestalled any commitment
concerning Imperial defence at the forthcoming
conference
concerned.

Rîght Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: May be
asked for or volunteered-.
flon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Now, what is our
position to-day? I submit that in our failure
to carry.out the agreement we made with respect to the defence of our harbours and
coasts and, our sea-borne trade, we have
abandoned our sovereîgn statue. What is the
use of pretending ta be a sovereign state?
What is the use of being the fifth trading
power in the world if we fail to keep our agreements and proteet our trade? What of our
inability to protect our neutrality? I submit that we are back to the colonial statue
we occupied before we were extricated by the
Statute of Westminster. We are accepting
help from Great Britain, and in the rnost
specific terme our legislators in another place
refrained with persistence-if one can refrain
with persistence-frorn any discussion of this
very imiportant question. We are willing to
accept, but we are not willing to give; and
that touches very nearly, it seerns to me, our
self-respect and dign.ity as a sovereign state.
1 know the British Empire is a unique organization. Nothing like it hes ever been seen
before. It has; constantly embarramsd and

have no doubt that in the future it will present
[hem with many curious problems.
It is interesting to conisider what Canada's
position would be if we were part of the
Freneh Empire, for instance. I have looked
into that situation., and, have gone into the
position of the differeet French colonies. First
of ail, I find that the peace army of France
-that is to say, the army of to-day-consists of W~5.000 men, beliind whom stand the
trained roserves, which would probably bring
thc total up to 2,000,000 men. The peacetime army of Francc is romposod as follows:
thero are Frenchmen in France, 383,000; the
Foreign Legion, 10,5D0; North African native
troops. 103,500; colonial native trocps, 87,500;
irregular and auxitiary native troops, 12.500;
the gendarmerie and the National Guard,
32,000. Oce-third of the peace-time army of
Fiance is *raised in the colonies of France.
If Canada were a part of the French Empire we sbould have to maintain an armiy by
conscription, an(l we sbotild bave to support
that armiy by taxation. We shoiîld not be
consulted about the conscription or the
taxation, and upon tbc outbreak of war we
should deliver cur trcops te tha -Motber
Country. Tbat w'culd bc ouir position if we
wore part cf the Empire of Franceo. co
f
tbe mcst liberal nations of the ivorl. What
our position would be if we w'ere part cf soe
othor empire 1 could not say. It Ns pirt of
the war plans cf Francoe at the oitlireak of
war to transport to France, in order to fight
for France. 450,000 men from the North
African colonies. Those troops are ail conscripted in the colonies to wbich they belong.
acd they are supported hy taxation iu those
colonies as far as their budgets will go.
If we were part cf the French Empire wxe
should nct be sitting here discussing wxhether
or net we would do tbis, that or the other
thing; wbat we ahould do would be laid
before us, anti it woeîld be orîr duîty' to obey.
1 would bring these considerations to the
attention cf soine bonourable gentlemen who
have x ery pronouniced vicîvs on the matter cf
rendering any ass~istance at ail to the British
Empire.
Now, in the wbole cf this question of national defonce, wbicbi aima at securityto the end tlîat ouir instituîtions may be carried

Ie
this Empire, by reason cf its strength and
population, it is possible te enjoy in full
nacasure a security which will make for our
happincss. We can flnd a measure cf security
wbicb we can find in no0 other way. What is
the overriding, the dominatieg fact in cil]
this? It is that Great Britain berself is the
cote of the Empire; that she is lacracîf a great
power; that during the past three haundred
years she has made a mighty contribution
to the progressa cf the wcrld in its conceptions
cf liberty, justice and comnaon decency.

pîcasucre to the remarks of the honcurable
gentlemana whbo bas jîîst taken bis seat, particularly to the points ho brougblt oct regardîng the fact that wc have no protection for
otîr coasts and for the trade cf this country.
He sýpoke cf coroplane carriers. Every word

MARCH 16, 1937
he said is true. In addition to Montreal and
Three Rivers, let us for a moment consider
the vulnerability to aeroplane attack of our
two Atlantic winter ports, to say nothing of
the winter ports on the Pacific. I have lived
in both Halifax and Saint John and know that
most of the docks at those points are of
timber. In almost no time a flotilla of aeroplanes could drop incendiary bombs and
others and set the whole of the docks on
fire and destroy them. Then where would
our trade be? How should we get any grain
out of this country? We should be tied upfinished.
In this great nation of ours we must look
to the protection of our trade routes, our
coasts and harbours. The British Navy is
the first line of defence of the Empire. The
Admiralty must keep as many ships as possible
concentrated as a striking force for action,
if neeeded, against any one or two or three
enemy powers. If we demand that a certain
number of ships be sent over to patrol our
coasts and protect our harbours, and if other
parts of the Empire demand the same sort of
thing, the British Navy will be split up into
various sections instead of remaining concentrated for the protection of the Mother Country and of the trade routes on the seven seas.
We have often heard the suggestion that
another country might be kind enough and
good enough to look after our interests with
her naval forces. But how would the pride
of the people of Canada be affected if they
saw foreign vessels patrolling our coasts and
protecting our harbours? And if any of those
vessels were to meet with disaster, and some
members of their crews were to be wounded
or killed, what would our feelings be?
We are told that Canada is about the
wealthiest country in the world. Look at our
grain production, our great expanse of forests,
our mines, our pulp and paper manufactories
and our general industry. Most lines of business are in full production and flourishing.
Yet with all our wealth we continue to sponge
on the Mother Country. That is not an
honourable thing for the people of this country to do. In the past one of the greatest
statesmen of this country declared that Canada ought to have a navy of its own for the
protection of its coast-line and ports. He
made an effort to organize a navy, but he was
turned down. I ask the people of this country: Where is our pride? Are we to sponge
any longer on the Mother Country and go
with our hats in our hands, saying "Please
help us and protect us against the enemy
in case of war"? Are we to continue that
attitude when we are so wealthy and the
people of the Mother Country are bearing a

175

heavy burden of taxes-a burden that has been
assumed in part for our protection? I say
the present condition is a disgrace. How long
is it going to continue? All I can say is, I
hope to God it will not continue much longer.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senatorsHon. Mr. LACASSE: The third General.
Hon. Mr. MeRAE: -in rising to speak to
the broad question before the House may I
crave your indulgence for a few moments while
I clear up a reference which was made to me
by some honourable senators earlier in the
session? That reference was based on a report
which credited me as saying that I wo.uld
raise my own private army to keep Canada
out of a war. That would certainly be a
ridiculous proposal in more ways than one. If
there is anything worse for a country than a
foreign war it is a civil war,. such as is now
going on in Spain. I ask honourable senators
to accept my word that I never made that
statement or anything resembling it.
On my return to Toronto on the 2nd of
December, 1935, not a few of my friends and
others were so disturbed about that report
that I found it necessary to depart from my
custom of never contradicting anything
appearing in the newspapers and I issued a
full denial through the kindness of the Canadian Press. It is not my desire, honourable
senators, to take up your time by reading
this denial.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Read it.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: The copy I have on
my desk is from page 5 of the Toronto Mail
and Empire of December 3, 1935, where any
honourable member who is sufficiently
interested can find it. That the report should
be referred to again this session only goes to
prove the truth of the old saying that
"Denial can never overtake rumour."
I approach the question before the House
with considerable diffidence to-night, honourable senators, following, as I do, two outstanding generals of the late War, gentlemen whom
I am proud to call my personal friends. I
agree with a great deal which they said. That
I do not concur in their line of argument is
perhaps due to the fact that I am disposed
to look at this matter in a more calculating
way-colder, if you will--having in view the
ultimate resuit of our participation in war.
It is now three years since I precipitated
in this Chamber a lengthy discussion on the
League of Nations. At that time I was
alarmed by the covenants which we, in common with other nations, had undertaken and
which I was sure would, if lived up to, involve
us in a foreign war. I know that many

176

SENATE

honourable senators thought I took entirely
too pessimistic a vjew at that time. Well, we
eould have been in three wars in the meantime
if the League obligations had been enforced,
and particularly we should have been at war
wvith Italy last year. However, these covenants,
apparently. no longer mean anything.
As
for aücompli.shing the objective for which it
was formed-peace-the League has been an
absolute failure.
Hon. Mr. HIAIG: ilear, hear.
Hon. Mr McRAE: It is possible that the
League may continue to render a useful
service as a common meeting-place for international co-operation with regard to matters
otheî' than war. I say "other than war,"
because that seems to have been the stumbling
block that wrecked it. But if it is to serve
sucb a useful purpose its covenants should
be rewrittee and member goveremeets relieved
from the embarrassmeet and stigma of flot
liv ing up te their signed agreements. Hewever, it (lees secmn to me that international
morality is pretty much a thing of the past.
Certainlv few nations are worryieg te any
degree about their obligations, financial and
other.
In my judgment the League of Nations
failed priecipally because it did not take inte
consideration human nature as we flnd it.' It
overlooked racial greed and hatreds which
govern mest nations in Europe. 1 arn told
that Sir Wilfrid Laurier referred to the League
as a "beautiful dream," and s0 it bas proved
te bc. 1 have only the deepest sympathy
for the hundreds of thousands of peace-loving
people throughout the world who placed se
much faith in the League and who consequently
must suifer great disappointment. As a matter
of fact the League's efforts began at the
wrong end-with goverements, which are often
changed overnight and which in any event but
represent their peoples. The teaching of peace
on earth and good-will towards men must
begin at the cradle. In this respect what is the
situation in Europe to-day?
I would remind honourable senators that it
ia new twcnty-three years since the outbreak
of the Great War. From that time onward
the rising generations in Europe have grown
rip under war or the shadow of war, with
hatred and distrust of their neighbours instilled into their very seuls. That applies
te men and women in Europe wh.o are now
thirty te forty yeairs of âge. They in ture
are teaching their children the same principles,
and this educatien under war conditions is
geing te affect many generations. The situation has lasted teo long te be changed in a
day or a year. Many long years;ý-generations,
Hen. Mr. MeRAE.

I fear-will have te pass before Europe can
be restored te anything like the conditions
which prevailed before the outbreak of the
Great War. It is net pleasant te think about,
but eertainly Eurepean races are farther
apart than they have been at any previeus
time in this century. It is thus we approacli
the present crisis in Europe-a continent
educated for war.
The expenditure in preparation for war bas
reached gigantic figures. It is estimated that
fourteen billion dollars were spent in 1935,
compared with four billions in 1913, the year
immediately
preceding the
World War.
Between 1925 and 19219 world armament expenditure was 4 per cent of the industrial
production of the world. Last year it increased te Il per cent, and it is estimated that
in the n*ext thýree years it will be anywhere
from 15 te 20 per cent of the total production
of capital goods. Thiek o'f it, honourable
senaterst In fact, the preseet programmes of
Britain and France alone contemplate an expenditure of twelve billion dollars over the
next few years. The result of «Il this expenditure was perhaps best summed up by
Mr. Neville -Chamberlain, Chancellor of the
Exchequer, who, speakîeg at Edinburgh, said:
Nothing but stark necessity would have made
me confess to sucli a negation ef cemmon sense
and cemmen humanity ... I cannot dismiss
the hope that we and the other nations of
Europe may pre6ently find somne less suicidai
way of ending our fears and suspicions of one
another before we are aIl ruined by our own
efforts te defend ourselves.
What Mr. 'Chamberlain meant by "before
we are all ruieed" is that inflation, which is
confiscation of capital, is in7evitable. It is
the sure way of taking away everythieg from
these who have. That is realized by aIl intelligent Furopeans. They have had experience
with it. Unfortunately this inflation caneet
be cenfined te Europe. It is in evidence in
America and je Canada-better business,
better prices, better times, ahl due te war.
What a foundation te build on!l It is worse
than the drifting sands. The reactioe is as
inevitable as inflation is certain if Europe
preceeda with- its present programme. It is
well that we should, take heed aed give due
consideration te the aftermath of the inflation
that is now on the way.
Under these desperate and uncontrollable
conditions we are f.acieg the next war. It
will be wholesale murder. Every desirable
quali.ty of human nature will be discarded.
The only objective will be to kilI. There
will be ne non-combatants; the nid and infirm,
the baby ie the cradle, aIl alike will be
subject te gasq attacks. If amny preof of the
serieuses of this new method of war is

MARCH 16, 1937
needed I refer to the fact that Great Britain
15 turning out gas masks at a rate which, it
is said, will make it possible to equip every
citizen with a mask within the next two years.
Highly mechanized warfare, more horrible
and more devastating than ever before, with
ail its terrors, particularly to the civil population, will be the order of the day. And there
will be, no such thing as the rules of war.
As regards Canada's participation in the
next Euro-pean confliet, I stand exactly where
I did in this House three years ago. I have
flot changed. I arn definitely opposed to our
participating. Developments in the interval
have not been such as to give me any reaison
to change my views. No matter how the next
war may end, it will mean the death of untold thousands and the financial bankruptcy
of the countries involved, resulting in unlimited inflation and the wiping out of the
earning.9 and savings of their citizens.
Located as we are, 3,500 miles from the scene
of action-some of us 6,500 miles-we could
not under any circumstances be early participants.
We should well and carefully consider al
the phases of. war before jum.ping into the
Kuropean cauldron. Our leaders of both parties are now committed to submiitting to
Parliament the decision as to war before
committing the country. I have gone furtber
and advocated a referendum. However, this
is probably a distinction without much difference, for, .iudging by the debate which
occurred in another place last month, it is
evîdent that if war were declared to-day the
Goverament wouid have to go to the country
and thus the people would make the decision.
I realize, honourable senators, that this
review of the situation is not a pleasant one.
It may be charged that it is a cold and calculating review. But I think we are rapidly
passing the point where any other consideration can be justified. After another war there
would ho littie left of Europe-and littie of
Canada, too, if we were in it.

Cuinîissioners for ýCanada, with authority in
respect of transport hy railways, ships, aircraft and motor vehicles.
He said: Honourable members, as chairman of the committee I present the report.
The committee has made a number of amendments to the Bill. There was not much
opposition to any of them, and I think they
ahl tend to make the Bill more acceptable.
Now I move their adoption. I understand
that the Government bas an amendment to
meet objections of our Maritime friends, and
it can be deait with on the motion for third
reading.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS:

What about the West?

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Our Maritime
friends moved an amendment in the committee, and it was defeated by a very narrow
mai ority. In these circumnstances I arn moving adoption of these amendments on the
dlistinct understanding that on the third reading the Government will propose the amendment referred to.
Righ.t Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I ar n ot rising to differ

motion to the effect that the amendmnents
are, he thinks, generally acceptable as improvements of the Bill. I think I can agree

prophecy that the Government amendment
to be moved will still further improve the
Bill. Yet I do not feel inclined to discuss
the committee.s report at the present tirne,
hecause I know that the suggested amendment, to be made on the third reading-on

TRANSPORT BILL
REPORT 0F COMMITTEE

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned dehate on the motion for the
adoption of the amendmcnts made by the
Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs
and Harbours to Bili B, an Act to establish
a Board of Transport Commissioners for
Canada, with authority in respect of transport
by railways, ships, aircraft and motor vehicles.
Riglit bon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: As al
honourable members understand, the stage of
the measure now before us is the consideration
of the amendments made to this Bill by the
Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs
and Harbours after a full review of the
31117-121

measure. Yesterdqy I asked the Government
not to press this bouse to a decision on the
amendments until honourable members had
had a chance to review their position in the
liglit of a further amendment which the
Government promised in respect to a certain
phase of the measure. Now that the time
asked for bas elapsed, I sec no reason why we
shouid not go ahead with the consideration
of the report of the committce, and personally
1 see no reason why the House should not
adopt the report. The committee made a
very extensive iist of amendments. It is, I
think, no exaggeration to say that those
amendments, one and ail, were improvements
of the measure. It is oniy f air to add that
ail were made-I say this subjeet to correction.-with the approval of the Minister in
charge of transport, who appeared quite
frequently before the commiltee and was
therefore in a position to state bis views.
Quite evidently the committee feit that the
Bill shouid be reported for consideration by
the buse. Personally I think the amendments as made should be adopted.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The motion
before the House, honourable senatois, is:
Moved by Right Honourable Senator Graham,
seconded by Honourable Senator Dandurand,
that the amendments made by the Standing
Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harhniirs to Bill 2, entitIed "An Act to establish
a Board of Transport Commnissioners for
Canada,, with âuthority in respect of transport
by railways,
ships, aircraft
and motor
výehicles," lbe nýow concurred in. Is it your
pleasure, honourabie -menbers, to adopt the
motion?
The motion was agreed to.
OONSIDERED

IN

COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Donnr'liy in the Chair.
bon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
members, I do not suggest that the committee
examine the Bill clause by clause. The flouse
bas just adopted in general the amendments
made by the Committee on Raiiways, Talegraphs and barbours, but I have some amendments to propose to the Bill as it now stands
after coming from that committee. Had there
been but one amendment, as I thought yesterday there wouid be, I shouid have awaited
the third reading stage before prToposing it,
bot there are a number of consequentiai
amendments, and I thought it was better that
we shouid go into committee to consider themn
aIl. Honourable members have before them
a copy of the Bill as amended by the Coin-

SENATE

mittee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours;
so they will be able to follow me as I proceed.
Section 5, subsection 1, in the Bill as
amended, reads as follows:
The Minister may, subject to the provision
of this section, license ships to transport
passengers and/or goods from a port or place
in Canada to another port or place in Canada.
The proposed amendment is that that subsection be deleted and the following substituted:
The Minister nay license ships to transport
passengers and/or goods from a port or place
in Canada on the Great Lakes or St. Lawrence
river to another port or place in Canada on
the aforesaid Great Lakes or St. Lawrence
river.
As it is necessary to have the terms "Great
Lakes" and "St. Lawrence river" defined, there
is an amendment proposed to section 2, the
interpretation section. The present clauses
(f) and (g) and all the following clauses of
that section would be designated by new
letters, and the following new clauses (f) and
(g) would be inserted:
(f) "Great Lakes" means lakes Ontario,
Erie, Huron (including Georgian Bay), Michigan and Superior, and tieir connecting waters;
(g) "St. Lawrence river" means the St.
Lawrence river as far seaward as a line drawn
from Father Point to Point Orient.
Riglt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What is the
name of that last Point?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Point Orient.
That is on the north side of the river.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Will my honourable friend permit me? The definition of "St.
Lawrence river" does not cover the tributaries
of the river, although the connecting waters
are included in the definition of "Great Lakes."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The next proposed amendment is to section 6, subsection
1. In the Bill as amended by the Railways
Committee this reads:
No goods or passengers shall be transported
by water, from one port or place in Canada to
another port or place in Canada, either directly
or by way of a foreign port or for any part
of the transport, by means of any ship other
than a ship licensed under this Part.
Under the amendment this would be contracted
to read as follows:
No goods or passengers shall be transported
by water from one port or place in Canada on
the Great Lakes or St. Lawrence river to
another port or place in Canada on the aforesaid Great Lakes or St. Lawrence river. either
directly or by way of a foreign port or for any
part of the transport, by mîeans of any ship
other than -a ship licensed under this Part.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That refers
to coasting, does it?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Yes.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The next proposed amendment is to section 8, subsection
1. In the Bill as amended by the Railways
Committee this reads:
This Part shall not come into force on, or
in respect of, any sea or inland water of
Canada until proclained by the Governor in
Counîcil to be in force on, or in respect of,
such sea or inland water.
It is proposed to delete that subsection and
substitute the following:
This Part shall not come into force until
proclaimed as in force by the Governor in
Council.
Subsection 3 of this section 8, in the Bill
as amended by the Railway Committec,
reads:
The Governor in Council may on the recommendation of the Board by proclamation extend
the application of this Part to transport by
means of ships registered in Canada over any
sea or inland water on or in respect of which
this Part is in force between ports or places
in Canada and ports or places outside of
Canada.
It is proposed that this be replaced by the
following:
The Governor in Council nay on the recomniendation of the Board by proclamation extend
the application of this Part to transport by
means of ships registered in Canada betweeii
ports or places in Canada on the Great Lakes
and St. Lawrence river and ports or places
outside of Canada.
It is but a consequential amendment. Is my
right honourable friend following me?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
got it all.

I have

Subsection 4
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
of the saine section reads:
Upon the coming into force of this Part on
or in respect of auy inland water of Canada to
which the Inland Water Freight Rates Act
applies, sections three, four and five of that
Act shall, during such time as, and in any
place wherein, this Part is in force be deemed
to be repealed.
Under the proposed amendment, this would
read:
Upon the coming into force of this Part,
sections three, four and five of the Inland
Water Freight Rates Act shall, during such
time as this Part is in force, he deemed to
be repealed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is all
right.
Subsection 5
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
of section 8 reads as follows:
The provisions of this Part shall not apply
in the case of ships engaged in the transport
of goods or passenîgers between ports or places
in British Columbia, Hudson Bay, Nova Scotia,
New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and
the Gulf or river St. Lawrence east of Father
Point, or between any of such ports or places
and ports or places outside of Canada.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Then it is

Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH: Henourable
members, the ostensible purpose of th(! Bill
before the House is te regulate rates, bnt its
real purpose is te assist the railways of the
country in the predicament in which thcy flnd
thernselves. That being se, the question at
once arises whether this is the best incthod
of assisting the railways-whether we may
properly assist the railways by penalizing
other forms of transport.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the expression?

By- what

is

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Penalizing.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Penalizing forms
of transport more recently discovered and
developed, particularly transport by road and
by air. There bas always been competition
by xvatc'r, and I think it is a recognized fact
that the railways cannet normally cempete
with that form of transport. 0f course, this
is a country in which water transport closes
down in the winter time, whereas the railways operate the year round.
The question in my mmnd is whether we
have a right te deny the people of our country the benefit which cornes from the more
recently developed forrns of transport.
If
we had adopted such a policy fifty or sixty
years ago we sh-ould have barred the railways and confined our people te herse transport. But such a pehicy was deerned unwlse.
I týhink it would be just as unwise row te
put a bar upon progress by penaliziug the
more rnodern forrns of transport. The devel'oprnent of our industries, our national life,
is dependent -Lîpon the free uise of modern
forrns of transport as they exist, or as they
may devehop in the future. It is clear that
we have te grapple with the question çof the
policy teo be folhowed with respect tu the
railways, but as matters stand te-day 1 know
of ne better rnethod of irnpreving their situatien than the direct subsidy we are giving.
Certainly I cannot approve of denyineg ourselves the tise of modemn conveniences, er of
penalizing thern in any way, for the purpose
ef assisting ocir railways.
This Bill carne before us in a certain ferrn
sorne wccks ago; it was subrnitted teo the Cernmittee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours,
and as we have it to-day it is an entirely
different Bill. We have, for instance, .imited
the operation of the Bill with respect te
acrophane transport to the traffie which exists
hetween urban centres, we have excluded

MARCH 17, 1937
coastwise shipping from the operations ,f the
Bill, and we have eliminated maritime province shipping.
Right Han. Mr. MEICHEN:
shipping on the aceans.

Coastwise

lion. Mr. GRIESBACH: Yes. We know
that the Bill, sa far as it applies to, road transport, trenches on the rights and prerogatives
of the provinces; that we can apply it only
to that portion of the traffic which is either
interprovincia] or provincial and foreign-and
that is only 1-8 per cent of the total. Ail
that is retained in the Bill for the purpose
af assistiag the railways is the regulation of
lake traffic; and in explaining this situation
the Minister made the simple statement that
the Bill was designed to cure a situation which
had arisen in lake trafflc, namely, that the
whole syqtem of shipping on the lakes was
bankrupt and the Bill proposcd to stabîlize
rates. 0f course we asic ourselves at once
how lake shipping which is bankrupt can be
benefited in any other way than by an increase of rates. Then we ask who it is that
uses this form of transport, in the main, and
is going to pay these increased. rates. That
question brings us to the grain trade of Western Canada. The long and the short of it
is that we are asked ta attempt to assist our
Canadian railways by laying what is in effect
a tax upon one particular industry, namnely,
the grain producing industry of Western
Canada.
I do not suppose there ever was a bill
before the Committee on Railways, Telegraphs
and Harbours which had such a mass of evidence adduced against it. We find that the
boards of trade of the Maritime Provinces
were against the Bill. I take it that tbey
have naw been satisfied. The provinces of
Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan appeared
by counsel and opposed that portion c>fthe
Bill which applies ta the roads. I think it is
saf e to say that, excepyt a few statements by
the railways tbemnselves and perhaps one or
two shipping concerns, the whole, af the evidenýce presented was against the Bill.
Some discussion bas occurred as ta the duty
af the Senate with respect ta a bill of this
sort, a Government measure introduced in
the Senate, and as ta whether we should
dispose af it here or pass it on ta the other
House. It seems to me that our duty with
respect to this propased legislation is precisely the samne as in the case of any other
bill. In choosing ta introduce, in this House
the Government believed the Bill would receive a fair hearing and alI interested parties
would have an opportunity of presenting their

views. That fair hearing bas taken place,
and anybody who wanted ta give evidence bas
had an lopportunity of doing sa. The gr.eat
mass af the evidence given was against the
proposed measure. The Bill was amended in
the most outstanding particulars with the
knowledge and consent ai the Minister, and
it bas been further amended ta-day. It bears
littie resemblance ta the one flrst introduced.
The Minister himseli said the legislation was
experimental; that a certain situation existed
which it was desirable ta remedy, and that
there should be some attempt ta make a
start. 1 have came ta the conclusion that
this is net a good start.
The Bill as originally drawn disclased a lack
of kn.owledge and information. As an evidence oi this 1 wauld point ta the willingness
of the Minister -ta consent to the variaus
amendments that came 'before him. To-day
the Bill cansists af virtually nothing but
regulations respecting lake shipping and
agreed rates. The ooiy evidence braught
befare the committee as ta the value af
agreed rates was that partion in which it
was stated that in England the autstandling
example ai agreed rates was cantained in an
agreement entered, inta between the Woolwarth Company and, certain railways, by
which the goods ai the company were ta be
carried for 4 per cent ai the annual turnover.
At once we became awarc ai the possibility
that if agreed rates should came ino farce
in Canads there might be a tremendous discrimination against smaller concerns for the
ben-efit ai the larger chain establishments.
Except for the cantrol ai lake shipping
and agreed rates, the Bill as it originally
came 'beiare us has almost disappeared.
Admitting -that samething should' he done,
if possible, ta 'assist our railways, 1 amn
inclined ta the view that they can be assisted
or their situation improved, only by the practice ai econamies within the railroad systemns
themselves, respecting new methods and the
like. Sa far as the matter ai agreed. rates is
concerned, I think the situation is fraught with
great danger.
I thiok this House would be well advised ta
standý this Bill aver, either by way ai the
six-months haist or by defeatiog it, in order
ta permit the situation ta develap and information ta accumulate, particularly with regard ta the Bill now before the United Stategi
Congress which aims ta d-o much thé sanie
thing under very different conditions. A year
hence we may knaw much mare about the
situation than we know to-day.
I arn quite satisfied that I must vote
against this Bill for this reason, if for no other,
that it seeks ta improve the situation ai the

railways in 'Canada by imposing an extra
charge upon the grain producers of this country, who already are sorely tried, by many
adverse economic conditions, and to lay the
whole burden upon the shoulders of that
portion of the public.

invested in that corporation. We as Canadians, therefore, being respohsible to the world
for the money that bas been invested in our
railroads, are naturally eager to do anything
we can to put these roads on a paying basis.
With that I am in entire accord.

Hon. J. T. HAI.G: Honourable members, I
thought that perhaps someone who was in
favour of the Bill would rise to speak. My
views are very much those of the honourable
gentleman who bas just preceded me.
As a representative in this House of one
of the Western Provinces, I ask how this Bill
is framed. First there, is the section dealing
with water transport. I shall come back to
that later. Then there is the section dealing
with transport by air, which is largely a new
mode of transportation. The Bill provides
that there shall be regulation of transport
by air between urban places and upon agreed
routes. To that there can be no very serious
objection. Then there is a section dealing
with transport by highway-a section which
the Minister himself really eliminated from
the Bill when, in answer to the question put
by myself, "Do you intend, if the provinces
do not agree, to put the highway sections into
operation?" he said: "No, not without the
consent of the provinces." Well, the province of Ontario through its responsible Minister has said it would not consent. and the
provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan,
through counsel appearing before the committee, have said they would, not consent. I
understand that the Ministers of the province
of Quebec also have said they would not consent. I cannot imagine any province that
would consent.
What is the issue involved in this Bill?
We as Canadians are asked to try to protect
the position of our railways. The railways
of Canada are one of the problems of the
people of Canada. Investors in Great Britain
and the United States say that we must solve
our railway problem or we cannot hope to
have the confidence of the outside world with
respect to the investment of money in this
country. At the present moment great pressure is being brought to bear upon the managements of the railways to induce them to
increase the salaries of employees. A strike
vote is now being taken, and union officials
say that if wages are not restored to their
former level there will be a fight to a finish.
Last year we voted some $43,000,000 to pay
the deficit of the Canadian National Railways, and the Minister of Finance bas said
that next year probably $35,000.000 would be
required.
For many years the Canadian
Pacific Railway paid no interest on the capital

said that the interest bad not been paid.

lon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: The interest bas been
paid on the bonds. What I meant to say
was that no dividends had been paid on the
common stock. For instance, I happen to
know a widow in Western Canada who is
about seventy-five years of age. She had one
hundred shares of stock. Before her husband
died be directed her to hold that stock. Later
there was a new issue of stock, and she now
bas four hundred shares. She used to get a
large income by way of dividends on her
stock. but now she gets nothing. She is complaining bitterly about the loss of revenue.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I was simply
correcting my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It was my language that
was wrong, not my idea.
That is the situation with regard to our railways. and we as senators from the different
parts of Canada are, I think, unanimously in
favour of doing anything we can to improve
that situation. I do not believe. however,
that the people of Canada expect us to do
anything that would impose an unfair burden
on anybody. The representation in this House
is not like that in the Commons, where there
is one member for every block of 40,000
people. In this House the Maritime Provinces
have as many members as the great province
of Ontario or Quebec. The Western Provinces have no more members than the Maritime Provinces. For this reason I think it is
our duty to sec to it that in matters of legislation each of the different parts of Canada
gets a fair deal as compared with the other
parts.
Now, what do we find as respects this Bill?
Even with the amendments which my honourable friend the leader of the Government bas
moved, the only change that can possibly
take place is an increase in rates on goods
going into or coming out of Western Canada.
That is the only benefit this Bill can give.

I agree with the henou-able junior senater
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) that the
Western farmers believe this measure woiild
resuit in an increase of lake freight rates.
For thaf reasen I do net like the Bill. Anether reason why I do net like it is tLat one
of its resuits wouid ho the subjection of
practical mon te ceutrol by theorists. Macy
things which iooýk good on paper do nef work
eut well in actnrai practice. I can imxagine
theorists on a Board teihing a mac who has
foiiowed shipping ai] his life that iiý must
carry orxiy sueir-and-snrch a cargo aixd must
chxarge only srich-aed--such a rate. Strong objection xvas taken te the provision in the
Bill that a shippe-. after liax-ieg fiied a rate,
xvould net ho able te increase it for t.hirty
days thereafter.
Weli. becairse of certain
cîrcumstances, a practical shipping mari right
find it profitable te carry a ship-load ef grain

weck, but if this Bih] were in effeet ho wouid
net dare te, reduce his rate te-day uciots propared te carry on witir that rate for ar heasf
t'hirty days. Therefore, as I se if, the stabilizatiori of rates under the Bill woniid inevitably rest i ru ncreasreg them.
Just reeethy there was a refusa] on the
part of the Goverement te stabilize raies te
tire primai-y pi-odnrcer in Wrestern Canada.
Now. if we are gcing te license ships we
may s0cio be asked te license farmers. te set
up a board autherized te defermine the number of acres that a farexer may seed, wifh a
view fo stabilizing the agricuitura] iedustry.
The honeurabie jinier senater from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) quofed an ediforial
from the Winnipeg Free Press. I arn rather
sorry ho did that, for I shahl net fý,e1 se
cemfortabie in veting against the Bill. since
I kcow tixat paper is opposed te it. The atti-

MAROR 17, 1937
tude of the Free Press towards certain other
legisiation was ruinous for Western Canada.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: It bas had a change
of heart.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: 1 arn opposed to the
Bill because I believe it would resuit in unjustifiable intea-ference with the operatrions
of practical business men. The country does
noV want that. Out in the West we have
experienced interference by theorists, who
advised farrners to go wbere there was no
water, and who, had some of us supplied with
cattie w'hich they later took away frorn us at
one cent a pound. This Bill too, I arn afraid,
would lead to unprofitable operations by
primary producers.
Hon. A. B. GILLIS: Honourable senators,
what is happening here is similar Vo what
happened at the meetings of the Railway
Committee. We waited from day to day for
sorneone who would corne along and speak
in support of the Bill, but no support wbatever was forthcorning, aside frorn one or two
telegrarns that were received frorn elevator
companies.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I confess thait
ail the private interests were against the Bill.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Private and public.
Every province that was represented there
wss opposed to it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is another
question.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: I say that eviery province of Canada wbich sent representatives to
the cornrittee was oppose-d to the Bill. 1
didt noV take a very active part in the comrnittee's proceedings, but I watcbed them
closely, and afiter listening to the evidence that
was given frorn day to day 1 carne to the
conclusion that the Government was standing in its own ligbt in not witbdrawing this
obnoxiousg measure. If anyone, bad corne
before the cornmittee and supported the Bill
there, wouldi bave been somne justification
for the Governrnent's continued determination
Vo bave it passed.
The Minister of Transport appeared before
tbe cornmittee a number of times. He was
very agreeable, I adrnit, sud consented to a
good many amendments being made, most of
wb.ich were more or legs -trivial; but as to
section 4, whicb is unquestionably the rnost
important feature of the Bill, the Minister
took a very strong stand. He said that if
w'e interfered with or arnendrd, that section in
any way he would witbclraw the wbole Bill. I
think that is a correcet version of his statement.

187

Now, the attempt Vo regulate lake freight
rates is not new. Honourable senators wil
rernember that in 1923-I think that was the
year-Parliament passed an Act for regulating
and, stabilizing lake freigbt rates. But that
proved futile; it did, not accornplisb anytbing.
Well. I imagine that if this measure is passed
it will have the same fate. I do net think
there, is any possibility of enforcing tbe provisions of the measure. Why, bonourable
senators, it would be neceasary -to have an
arrny of police and patrol steamers patrolling
the lakes to prevent constant infringernent.
Every port on the lakes would bave to be
rnanned witb police.
As other bonourable meýmbers bave pointed
out, the main object of the Bilh would appear
Vo be the passing of legishation for assisting
the railways. Yet, as the hoýnourable junior
senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) bas
made clear, this Bill would, bave no such
result. So far as I can see, tbe only effect of
the Bill would be Vo increase tbe cost cf
ransporting wbeat and other cornrodities
by water to and from Vhe West. In the course
of tbe commrittee's sittings the rernark was
rnade by someone VbaV wben wbeat got Vo the
head of the lakes it was out of the farmers'
bande, and consequently any regulation of lake
rates would not affect the price whicb the
farmer receives for bis grain. WelI, Vo, say
the least, I tbink that is utter nonsense.
Everyone knows tbat the cost cf transportation, wbetber by ra.il or water, is one cf the
important factors tbat bave Vo be considered
when the pri-e of grain is being fixed. Consequently if the rate on the Great Lakes is
increased it will go bard witb the Western
Provinces.
I n4 cd noV, bonourable senators, elaborate
on the conditions prevailing in the West today. 1 would flot say tbe outlook is bopeIess;
on the contrary, I Vbink tbe country will corne
back; but during tbe past few years we bave
been bard bit. Grasshoppers, dtrought and
oth-er rnisfortunes 'beyond buman cuntrul have
very sericrusly bandicapped tbe people of the
West. But Iast year the farmers on the
Prairies suffered, a further misfortune: by
reason of the Grain Board noV being allowed
to function they were victimized, Vo the exVent of more than $60,000,000. That statement cannot -be denied. If this Bihl is
enacted an additional burden will be placed
upon the shoulders of tbe struggling farmers
of Western Canadia.
I was very glad Vo hear tbe honourable
leader of the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
suggest an arndment to exempt the Maritimes frorn the operation of the Bill. I congratulate tbem on that concessioo The Mari-

time Provinces appear to be about as prosperous as any section of Canada. In fact
each of those provinces has been able to
balance its budget. Undoubtedly in this respect
they are better off than the Prairie Provinces. for unfortunately we in the West caninot balance our budgets. We have to depend
on our good friends in Eastern Canada to
help our struggling farmers. W/e are neither
ashamed to, ask nor ashamed to receive that
support, because, as honourable members are
aware, Quebec, Ontario and the Maritime
Provinces are just as mîich interestedi in the
success of the farmers of the Prairies as we are.
Being a Western man. 1 feel that this Bill
vitally affects the people of the Prairie Provinces.
And certainly anything that might
tend to a(ld ýto tlieir burdens should be neither
encouraged for endorsed by this Chamber.
For these reasons, and others whicb I might
advance if trne permitted. I shahl vote against
the Bill.
Hon. HENRY A. MULLINS: Honourable
members, as a Westerner who bas Iived in the
West for a number of ycars and bas been
trying to make two blades of grass grow
wbere only one grew before, 1 bave some
knowledge of agricultural conditions in the
Prairie Provinces. I have, lived in the homes
of the pioneers of the W/est. I have seen
that country develop.
In the early davs the grcat difficult ' in
the West was lack of transportation, and when
we went out there you in the East tried to
discourage us. You said there would be su
littie traffic that the Canadian Pacifie would
not earn sufficient revenue to pay for axle
grease. I have before me a statement made
in those days that cattie would be frozen to
death in numbers that would astonish settiers,
and that the pionýeers there were often maimed
for ]ife hy frost-bite. 1 bave lived there for
fifty years and have neyer yet been frostbitten. We bave a wonderful country in the
three Prairie Provinces, with 250,000 square
miles of fertile land.
Yuu may ask nie wi'at is t he n ýaiter with
that countr 'v. 1 hiaxe made a caieful study
of the whole situation, and I say without
hesitation the pcimary trouble is freight rates.
My right honourable leader in this Huse
(Right Hon. Mc. Meighen) knows that as
well as I do. I have under my band a statement hie made in 1925. and with bis permission I shall read it. At ýthat time he was
leader *of bis party in the other House, and
its membership was not such a conglomeration as it is to-day. There is now a little
of everything over there. Let me give the
Hou. Mr. GII.LIS.

Social Crediters their due. They raised the
antie, as the old Western saying was, on the
Progressives. They may have a twisted mentality, but they raised the ante su high on
those Progressives that at the last election
tbey left every one of thern at home. The
Social Credit party has in its ranks school
teachers, professors and ministers-men who
neyer hiad to get out and earn a dollar off
the land, and never had the experience of
tbe pioneers.
One of the flnest pioneers that Canada ean
boast of is the habitant of Quebec. 1 rubbed
shoulders with himn when I used to ship trainloads of cattle from the W/est to Montreal
and Quebec.
Occasionally when the train
broke down I had to buy hay from hima to
take care of my cattle. I say there is no finer
man than the habitant of Quebec. And yet
some professor in the States last week said
hie would rather have an Alabama nigger than
tbe habitant of Quebec. I ýask honourable
members to imagine a statement of that kind
from a man who is said to be a professor.
I have been in the open more or less aIl my
life. I have never had the privilege of a
university or college education. My life bas
been forged on the anvil of hard knocks.
1 amn astonished that a man of culture and
experience could makie sucb a statement concerning the habitant of Quebec. When the
professor used the word "nigger," it seemed
to me hie showed the kind of man hie was.
Had hie said "negro" or "coloured man," hie
would have (lisplaycd sýomervhat better taste.
Hon. Mr. LY'NCH-STAUN-'TON\: Is the
hionoucable gent lemian sure that tliat man is
not part negro?
Hon. Mr. MULLINS: The acousties of this
Chamber is not very good, and I do not hear
my honourable friend distinctl 'v. I admire
our pioncer, the habitant, and that insult wvas
un.îustified. I resent such unwarranted disparagement of the pioneci of Quebec, as I
would of the r'iuneer of the West. 11e is
stî'uggling very bard to pull throughi.
In my opinion this Bill will strangle apd
rob the poor agriculturist of Western Canada.
Ail down throughi the ycars we have been
trying to get away from high freight rates.
I bad intended te read the speech my right
honotîrable leader made in 1925, for fear he
had forgotten it and migbt endorse the Bill.
We were on the platformi together wben hie
expressed the opinion which 1 held Lhen and
still hold. 1 shall now quote bis remarks lest,
I forget to do so as I denounce this obnoxious
measure. My riglit honourable leader, who
wvas then Prime Minister, dealt with a
pamphlet which, he said. hiad been circulated

MARCH 17, 1937
in the constituency by the Liberal-Progressive
party. He described as falsehoods staternents
in the pamphlet referring to bis attitude
regarding fneigbt rates in Western Canada,
and repeated the statement he made at
Selkirk on the previous Thursday as to bais
past and present policy:
I say f0 the farmers of these plains and to
every farmer in Western Canada that no
Governmnent of which I arn the head will take
any steps which wil resuit in raising freight
rates, hecause I know that no raise of rates
is necessary.
Freight rates bave been the bugbear of
Western Canada.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. MULLINS: You may laugb, you
Easterners who live in close pnoximity to
transportation. 1 arn talking frorn experience.
I paid thousands of dollars to the Canadian
Pacifie when it was the only nailroad in the
Western country. 1 had the honour of sbipping
the flrst train-load of cattle ovor that road
when it was coupled up at Jackflsh Bay. I
have been in that business since 1890. 1 have

I cite section 8 of the contract wbich forrns

Now, I ask honourable members who, have
been in this House for so rnany years, why
did you -deprive us of 'that concession? In
1917 you thought that under a war measure
you had a good chance to take it aiway from
us. We had by that agreernent secured ithe
privilege, as stated, up to 1030, in return for
the rnortgage we took on the lines and our
endorsernent of the ibonds of the Canadian

retained that privilege ap to 1930. After that
agreement was signed the farmer in Manitoba

get along without a prosperous West. I passed
through drought for a numbcr of ycars wben
farming a tbousand acres of land. l had no
rain on that land, and I know wbat the
struggle means. I neyer saw such a terrible
time as Western Canada has gone through in

As 1 have said, under the agreemnent with
the Canadian Northern Railway we secured a
reduction of four cents a hundred on livestock and other commodities. At that time

MARCH 17, 1937
portion of the enormous delit that lias been
saddled on the people of Canada by reason
of the railway situation.
Let us go back thirty-two years to the
time whem there came into hcing in the great
Canadian West two hrand new provinces,
ecdl of which lias cost the peopie of the West
-yes, and the people of Canada-tens of
millions of dollars. With the knowledge we
have at the present moment, and, in the iight
of our experience with respect to too mucli
government, will anybody argue that two
brand new provinces wouid lie established in
the year 1937 as they were in the year 1905?
I think not. Millions of dollars have been
spent becau.se the peopie of the great West
were clamouring for thc creation of two new
provincial gov.ernments. To do what? To
protect vested, interests whidh they held as
citîzens of the great West.
If we go back down the years we find that
in 1905 tIare was oniy one great railroad
systemn rinning tîroughout the great Canadian West; but the people of tIc West,
having regard to their vested interests,
ciamoured for additional railway facilities.
Did they get them? We ail know they did.
Two additional transcontinental lines--part of
tliem scrappcd or tomn up to-d'ay-were built
liecause of the clamour and thec daims of tIc
vested interests and the people of the great
Canadian West. This being so, it seems to me
the allegation that this Bill tends to serve
vestcd interests comes with very lad grace
from one who lives in the West. I wanted to
asic thc lonourabie tlie junior member from
Winnipeg wîat vestcd interests lic referrcd
to. Doca lie mean the vestcd interests of the
Canadian people, who have to put up approximately $50,000,000 a year by reason of the
railway situation in Canada as it affects the
publie? If those are the vested interests
involved, who is responsible for thc burden
of debt? No part of the country or no ciass
of people is more responsibie than the great
Canadian West and its people. In saying this
I do not want to be misunderstood, or to be
taken as criticizing tIec daimns made by the
people of the Canadian West. They were
doing at the time what tliey beiievcd best to
protect their own present and future interests.
Who can criticize tlicm for that? But it
seems to me that it ili hecomes any distinguisîed senator from the West to place
the responsibiiity for this measure--which
presumabiy contemplates dealing in reasonable equity witli ail parts of Canada-upon
the shoulders of others, and to charge that thc
whole thing is the creation of vested interests.
Whuil we are talking about vested. interestsý-and this is, in a measure, on thc side
-let us see what our dear Western fricnds

191

have done. They have in the years gone by
voiced their dlaims more loudly, perhaps,
than any other part of Canada. The facts
speak for themselves. Have I not recently
read in the newspapers, or heard, that some of
these Westerners, reverting to the time, about
thirty years ago, when many of themn lived
on farmis and went to schools ini Ontario or
Quebec, were advancing claims in connection with 'the transfer to Alberta and Saskatchewan of natural resources as held by the
Federal Government bef-ore those two provinces came jnto being? If you can imagine
anything more far-fetched or anything more
clearly demonstrating the dlaims of vested
interests, I should like to know what it is.
There are about this Bill many things I
do not fully understand. I do not know how
it is going t.o work *out. 1 ecrtainly should
flot have said a word on it had it flot been
for a couple of entirely illogical points which
were raised. I refer particularly to the suggestion with regard to the protection or maintenance of vested interests, presumably in
the province of Ontario and Quebec. I will
go right along with my honourabie friend
the junior senator fromn Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Haig) in opposing what appear to be improperly handled or improperly controiied
vested interests. But does this Bill not
contemplate the reasonable protection of the
inheritance that has come to the Canadian
people as a resuit of the railway situation?
Does it not contemplate the reasonable protection of the transportation facilities that
the people of the West have to make use of
during about hall the year, when no other
transportation facilities are available? Does
the Bill contemplate anything more or les
than the protection of transportation facilities that h-ave been here for many years,
since long before some othcr transportation
interests were ever dreamed of? As I understand it, the Bill contemplates giving a
reasonable, square deal to the vested interests
of the Canadian people in the railways of
Canada, wh.ether those railways are owned
and dominated by the Canadian people or
by that great private concern. which lias been
of suci *marked henefit to Canada in the
years gone hy. I hope the lionourable junior
senator fromn Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. H-aig)
or somebody else will go into this question
of vested interests, because in lis speech lie
made use of tlie terra "vested interests" flot
once, I think, but two or three d-esen timee,
and it seems to me that we ought to know
what is meant by it.
In conclusion I want to say that I think
that in years past the people of Western Canada have been louder in demanding their
rîglits and the protection of their vested

interests than have the people of any other
part cf Canada. As a resuit of the insistent
clameur of the people of the great Canadian
W"est, who were contending for certain things
in order te proteet their vested interests, much
money has been spent on the Hudson Bay
Ra ilway and transcontinental railw.ays.

prevince cf which I hav e the honeur te be a

There is ene thing about which there is ne

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Fer once it is right.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I de net know. I
was interested in reading this editoriai, which
attacks the Gevernment for intreducing a
Bill of this kind and calis upen it te withdraw.
I think it is the first instance in
which this great expornent ef Libcralism ever
attempted te damn a bill introduced by a
Liberai Government.
There is just one more thing that I want
te say. The farmer in Manitoba is taxed te
the limit and beyond. As a resuit cf an
inquiry I made the ether day I find that the
cost cf the Dominion Department of Agriculture bas been incrcascd by $3,000,000 witbin
two years. I find that even in the smail prevince of Manitoba there are twe experimentai
farms. as weil as a huge agricuiturai college
which is lauge eneugb for the state cf llinois,
probablv one cf the largest states of the
Arnerican Union.
All thio îueney is being
spent in order te do something for the farmer,
but in the meantime farms are being seid for
taxes. If the expenditure and censequentiy
the taxation ef this ceuntry are te go on
cxpanding or increasing, I do net know what
the end wiii be. This Biii wouid increase the
burden upon Western farmers, who aiready
are iabouring under a burden wbich is tee
hcavy for tbcm te bear. There is ne questien about tbat. The honourabie leader of
the Geverniment
(eon.
Mr. Dandurand)
admitted that the measure wouid resuit in
higher charges fer transporting wheat through
the Great Lakes. The object cf the Bili is
te dcstroy competition.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The Minister
stated before the cemmittee that that was
net the object of the Biii, nor wouid it be
the effeet of the Bili.
Hen. Mr. McMEANS: I understand that,
but I do net place very much value on bis
words. I weuld rather take the opinion of
that great expenient of Liberaiism, the Winnipeg Free Pressý, a copy of whicb I have
in my hands. That paper says the Dili
wouid undoubtedly destrey competition. The
farmer is aiready overburdencd with taxation,

MARCH 17, 1937
yet the Government comes along with this
Bill which, by destroying competition, would
increase lake rates and thereby make that
burden even heavier.
It is a matter of history that a rebellion
was threatened in Manitoba a good many
years ago because railway competition was
lacking and high freight rates consequently
prevailed. After the Roblin Government
came into power the Red River Valley line
was built, and competition brought about a
decrease in rates. There is no necessity of
going further into that history at this time.
I refer to it simply to show that rates always
increase when there is no free competition.
How can any reasonable person get up in this
House and vote for a Bill that would destroy
competition on the Great Lakes? If you
destroy competition you destroy the whole
structure under which the transportation
business is carried on all over the world.
Let me remind the honourable leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) that Sir
Wilfrid Laurier built the Trancontinental
Railway, which cost a frightful sum, and said
he was going to establish a freight rate of
13 cents per 100 pounds from Armstrong down
to Quebec. But what happened? Well, the
rates went up to 33 or 34 cents, and the whole
force of the Government could' not bring them
down. Under the present Bill the Government
plans to fix freight rates. But no Government could do that. The companies concerned are stronger than any Government.
They could say to the Board, "We will carry
grain at such a rate and no less." To my
mind the Bill is not sensible. So far as I am
concerned, as one who lives in the province
of Manitoba, I am not going to vote for any
measure that would destroy competition with
regard to rates for carrying grain down through
the Great Lakes.
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN: Honourable
senators, my standpoint in approaching this
measure may be different from that of some
honourable members who have already spoken,
I wonder if opponents of the Bill are not in a
state of fear of what may happen. I am
thinking of it from another point of viewthat what is feared by those who oppose the
Bill will not occur. I live in a part of Canada
where the people are at present in constant
fear that something may happen to a greater
extent than it has happened so far. For years
now we have had, on the Statute Book an
Act giving the Board of Railway Commissioners certain control over railroad and express rates. The object of the present Bill
is to extend the powers of that body, which
would hereafter Le known as the Board of
Transport Commissioners, to include super-

193

vision over the rates charged by every form of
transportation in Canada. If I am to judge
the new Board, by the conduct of the old one,
I cannot become greatly alarmed by this
measure. On the other hand, if I felt that
the fears of my honourable colleagues from
the West were well grounded, I should be
inclined. to support their stand.
Regulation would not inevitably lead to
higher rates. Is it not possible that without
regulation over certain forms of transportation, such as steamships and aeroplanes, there
might be a combination of those interests
and an increase in rates on the Great Lakes
and in the air? This Bill would give us somQ
control over these rates. There would be a
Board to which we could appeal if we felt
that certain rates were extortionate or unreasonable. That has been the kind of safeguard provided by the Board of Railway
Commissioners ever since it has been in existence. The smallest community in Western
Canada or in any other part of the country
could protest to that body if it considered it
was being imposed upon by unjust rates or
services.
I certainly should not like to see any
measure passed by this Chamber which would
result in the imposition of a single cent of
additional expense upon the farmers of Western Canada in connection with the movement of their products or the transportation
from Eastern Canada of goods which they
consume; but I look upon this measure as
an attempt to control all forms of transport
under the Board of Transport Commissioners,
just as the railways have been controlled in
the past under the Board of Railway Commissioners.
An insinuation has been made that the Bill
is in the interest of the railways. I am not
here to speak on behalf of the railways, but
I want to relate an incident that occurred in
one part of Western Canada, just to show
that the railways are giving good service and
are able to give it at times when their competitors are not. ¶ think it is only right
that this should be said. The southern part
of Alberta Las experienced this year, from
blockaded roads, the worst conditions that
have ever been known since that part of the
province was settled. The town of Cardston,
for instance, with a population of 2,000, was
eut off from railroad, truck and mail facilities
for nearly ten days. Railroad lines and highways alike were blocked. What did the railway management do? It did not throw up
its hands. Half a dozen of the railway's
branch lines in that country had been rendered almost useless by competition from
trucks during that part of the year when the

31117-13

EDITION

weather is good. Yet the company sent out
snow-plows and crews of men, and after many
days of labour these were finally successful in
getting the braneh ines open for service.
Many communities on those branch lines were
in a dangerous position. Some of them were
50, 60 or 70 miles away from large centres,
and had -communication with them been
delayed much longer they might have run
short of the very necessities of life. Competition by trucks-which, by the way, have
net been able to operate on the highways of
Southern Alberta this year until the last week
or ten days-had forced a reduction in railroad service over those branch lines to once
or twice a week. Yet a large expenditure of
money was made to serve communities
depending upon those branc lines when no
other transportation was available.
I do not want to sec competition destroyed.
But this Bill, as I understand it, would net
affect services in Hudson Bay or on the Pacifie
coast. If lake freight rates became too high,
grain producers in the greater part of Manitoba and in almost all of Saskatchewan could
move eut their products through Hudson Bay.
In Alberta at the present time we are moving virtually 100 per cent of our grain through
the western outlet, at Vancouver. I look
upon these competitive routes as providing
a form of competition against the Great Lakes,
in case any attempt is made to impose
exorbitant charges for the movement of grain
through the lakes. However, I do not think
that any board having control over all forms
of transport in Canada would permit an increase in lake freight rates that would be a
tax uipon the Western farmer. That is my
own feeling. If I thought the Bill would
result in higher freight rates on grain, or on
groceries, provisions and clothing coming in
from the East, I should oppose it in this
Chamber.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Well, it has been
admitted that that would be the result.
Hon. GEORGE GORDON: Honourable
senators, I agree with my honourable friend
from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan) that
the Board of Railway Commissioners has done
a valuable work in adjusting railroad rates
and matters of service. But it seems to me
that railroads are necessarily a kind of monopoly, because it is net every person who can
build a railway. This Bill would affect two
forms of transportation in particular: transportation by air and by water. Now, I believe that these forms of transportation should
be left alone, just as Providence intended,
to operate freely with competitors. Thousands of men can command enough money to
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN.

build aeroplanes and supply transportation
through the air. Likewise, thousands of people
can build boats for carrying freight on the
water.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: And lose money.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Yes, they may lose
money. Every business is open to that risk.
So far as boats and aeroplanes are concerned,
they have only one thing to consider in determining what rates they shall charge, and
that is cost of operation. In that respect they
are in the same position as the grocer, the
hardware merchant, the miller, or the man
in any kind of business. For my part, I am
old-fashioned enough to believe that competition is the life of trade.
I can understand the feelings of my honourable friends from the West who oppose the
Bill, and I also understand the attitude of
the railroads. The honourable junior senator
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) said the
Bill would not result in an extra dollar of
revenue for the railroads. To my mind, the
evidence before the committee is that in the
event of the Bill being enacted the railroads
may derive extra revenue from package freight.
But I do not understand how they can derive
any advantage on grain from the head of
the lakes to Montreal. The railroads cannot
compete with water transportation. Of course,
in the winter time they might get some of
the grain traffic, but during the season of
navigation practically all goes by the cheaper
route.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: What about the
Hudson Bay Railway?
Hon. Mr. GORDON: That is virtually out
of the question. Before the railway was
undertaken I thought it should not be built,
and since it has been builtHon. Mr. MURDOCK:

Yeu are surer.

Hon. Mr. GORDON: I am surer.
From what I have said honourable members
will realize that I shall vote against the Bill.
If it is enacted it can result in nothing but
higher transportation charges on grain from
the West, and I do not believe that this
country as a whole has any right to penalize
our Western friends. At best the railways
would benefit but little, and while higher
freight rates might help our people very
slightly, the increase would penalize the West
severely. Therefore I feel that I must vote
against the Bill.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Will the honourable gentleman allow me just one question?
How do railway rates in the Canadian West
compare with similar rates in the United
States?

MARCH 17, 1937
Hon. Mr,. GIORDON: 1 amrn ot familiar

TRANSPORT BILL
MOTION

FOR

THIRD

READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion for the third
reading of Bill B, an Act to establish a Board
of Transport Commissioners for Canada, with
authority in respect of transport by railways,
ships, aircraft and motor vehicles.
Hon. A. D. MeRAE: Honourable senators,
I think there is one thing we will all agree
on. namely, the seriousness of the railway
situation in Canada. Undoubtedly it constitutes our major problem. Railway earnings of last year were encouraging in that
they showed improvement over those of the
preceding year, but they were net such as to
lead us to be optimistic. I would call the
attention of the IIouse to the fact that in
Canada we have a very limited population,
some ten and a half millions of people, and
that there is a limit to the freight and other
business they can furnish to our over-extended
railways. I notice from reports at hand to-day
that Canada's international business has increased to $1,585,000.000 for the last eleven
months, which is a very fine showing, and a
large increase over the business of the preceding year. In the period preceding the
depression the Canadian people produced more
business per capita, I think, than the people
of any other nation, and the figures I have
given indicate that we are rapidly getting up
to top speed. The point I am trying to
make is that there is a limit to the business
which ten and a half million people can furnish. and at existing rates there is a limit
to the amount of revenue our railways can
collect.
The balance shet of the Canadian National
Railways still shows a very heavy deficit, and
the balance sheet of the Canadian Pacific
Railway is net such as to offer great encouragement to the sharoholders. But there is one
very serious factor that is not included in
these balance sheets, namely, obsolescence.
Anyone who studies the situation must realize
that obsolescence is a factor which sooner or
later must be met. The development of competitive transportation services is forcing a
recognition of this fact on many railways on
this continent at the present time. The only
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE.

reason why greater efforts have not been
made to meet obsolescence, which is so rapidly
developing in the railways of America, is
inability to secure the capital necessary for
this purpose.
We have heard a great deal of discussion
about competitive services. I want to remind
honourable senators that every mile of good
road which is built only adds to the competition wbich the railways have to meet. It
was brought out before the committee that
mechanical improvements, such as the Diesel
engine. were going to reduce the power costs
of trucks and lorries at least two-thirds, and
that this will put these competitive services in
an even more advantageous position than
they occupy at present. May I add, honourable senators, that much of the business that
has now left our railways can never be
restored to them. One might as well try to
put humpty-dumpty back on the wall. It cannot be donc. The public will not stand for
it. The people will demand the services that
are cheapest and most convenient. In my
judgment the Canadian people will not stand
for any brakes on progress. If we were to
do so, how long would it be before we were a
generation behind the times? I feel sure tînt
Canadians will not be content to remain
behind the times with regard to transportation
any more than with regard to any other conveniences required by modern society.
There are only two ways out of our railway difficulties. I know it is net popular to
talk in this wayv, but there is no harm in
looking at cold ficts. We all appreciate that
we cannot do without our railways; the commercial life of the country demands their continuance. We must pay for the cost of their
operation either by way of direct bonuses to
the railways or by advanced freight rates.
All honourable senators will agree with me,
I think, that the present deficits cannot continue indcfinitely. I do not believe the publie is prepared to stand for an advance in
rates. Therefore, it scems to me, the only
way to solve the problei is to bonus both
railways, as we are now doing with the
Canadian National. The costs of operation
are daily increasing. We are in a period of
Supplies, labour, and all
increased costs.
things that go into the operation of a railway, are on the way up in price. For reasons
that I have shown, we ennot expect any
great increase in passenger and freight traffic.
Then how will the companies be able to continue in business unless some provision is
made for them to take care of their deficits?
I believe we might just as well consider that
we are now giving a bonus of from fortv to
fifty million dollars a year to the Canadian

MARCH 18, 1937
National Railways and that we must be prepared to keep on giving it almost indefinitely.
I do not say the country cannot stand that.
It is certainly a serious strain, though, and
many people fear our solvency is involved in
the situation.
I realize we all have been a bit disappointed
because there are in evidence so few economies
from co-operation which we hoped would be
developed between the railroads. Honourable
members know my views on that subject, for
I have expressed thern before. I am convinced that the desired co-operation can never
become effective except under pressure. If
the time comes, as I believe it will, when we
shall have to bonus our railways, we can then
probably use some influence to bring about
that uniformity which is absolutely essential
to the best economic management of our railway systems.
I have been hopeful that the apparent
coalition which is in evidence in another place
might result in the bringing down next
session, at the latest, of a measure which
wouldi deal with this entire transportation
problem; that unanimity of thought in the
other House should bring forth a .really forward
step towards solution. If it should, I am sure
every member of this House would acclaim it.
But what about the Bill before us? It
deals only with the fringe of our problem. It
has been saidi that it is not well workedi out.
Certainly the evidence before the committee,
the many amendments made, the uncertainty
of many honourable members of the committee as to the working out of the details,
the regulation of business involved, the impossibility of dealing with truck and bus
competition-the constitutional issue,-the
little benefit that the Bill offers to business,
and other reasons, justify, I think, the statement that the measure has not been well
considered, and that, if enacted, it would be
a very uncertain factor in our transportation
problem.
It is not my intention, honourable senators,
to review much of the ground gone over
yesterday, but I do want to refer to two items
in the Bill which strike me as very important.
The first is agreed rates. Now, if I understand the expression, "agreed rates" means that
some shipper who has sufficient business to
interest the railways may enter into a contract
to have it carried- at less than the current rate,
subject to the approval of the Railway Commission. That implies two rates, one for the
particular shipper and a somewhat higher rate
for the small shipper who has not the same
advantages to offer the railways.
Hon. Mr. KING: On the same commodity?

197

Hon. Mr. McRAE: On the same commodity.
It seems to me, honourable senators, that that
is turning back the clock about thirty years
and approaching somewhat the condition that
existed before the Railway Commission was
established.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
gentleman knows that the small producer can
get the same rate by applying to the Board.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: I quite understand
that. But is that fair? Naturally the large
shipper gets his rate based on the business
he has to offer. I know that the little
shipper can come to Ottawa and appear
before the Railway Board. But I ask the
honourable leader, can that man afford, to
hire lawyers to present his case?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think he does
not need that assistance.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Probably he does not.
But will he have the ability or the courage,
or can he afford the expense, to present
his case properly? We are going back to the
conditions that prevailed thirty or even fifty
years ago. We are going back to conditions
that, in part, built up the great trusts of the
United- States. I remember reading the history of the Standard Oil Company. The
company was built up on that system. It
went a step further. It not only got advantage
over the little shipper, but it also collected
what he paidi over and above its rate.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: May I interrupt
my honourable friend? I have considerable
esteerm for his judgment. He has told us of
the very precarious situation of the railways.
The purpose of agreed rates on the railways
is simply to allow the railways an opportunity
similar to that which trucks and lake shipping
have in being able to make agreed rates. The
railways say, "If we are to live, surely we
should be given that equal treatment."
Hon. Mr. MeRAE: The honourable leader
is quite correct. It developed in the committee that the trucks were making special
rates for Woolworth's and other big department stores, lower than those made to individual shippers. I am sure a majority of the
members of the committee felt that this practice was not fair and should be changed.
I say you cannot correct one mistake by making another.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, but you can
put them on an equal footing before the
Railway Commission.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: We are on the right
basis now, but I contend that if we adopt
this system in order to correct an unfair

198

SENATE

situation in truck competition. we shall be
making two mistakes instead of one. I am
perfectly frank in saying that this is also a
retrograde step. We have been hearing for
the last year or two about chain and department stores handicapping the little fellow.
Are we going to increase the handicap? The
truck situation should be remedied.
Railway regulation should not be changed.
I now come to the other point in the Bill
to which I take exception, and which, I
think, is also an innovation: control of lake
freight rates. There has been free competition in the lake shipping business for generations. The business has never received any
subsidy from either the Federal Government
or any of the provincial governments. Men
invest their money in ships, just as they do
in any other line of business, for profit. If
they have overdone it, if they have brought
in too many boats from the United Statesfor that is where they have come from; unfortunately very few of our lake boats have
been built in Canada-if they have brought
those boats in for gain, and if to-day they
are operating them at a loss, they are just
out of luck. Why the Government should
concern itself about this private investment
and hope by legislation to restore solvency to
private concerns, when there is no complaint
by the public as to freight rates, nor shortage of boats-on the contrary, there are too
many-and why we should be asked to give
effect to legislation to restore three or four
steamship corporations to solvency are beyond
my comprehension.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
object of the Bill.

That is not the

Hon. Mr. McRAE: I wish to deal now with
a reference made during the debate yesterday.
The honourable leader of the Government
said, and quite correctly, that the Minister
had not stated that the rates would go up.
I sat in the Railway Committee for some
weeks, and I want to say the atmosphere was
so saturated with references to the insolvency of these lake shipping companies that
honourable gentlemen could come to only one
possible conclusion, and that was that the
rates were to be raised. In fact, if my information is correct, the very licensing system
under this Bill would tend to a withdrawal of
a sufficient number of boats to help raise
the shipping rates. I cannot see why the
Government should concern itself about the
lake shipping companies. There are plenty of
ships available for traffic, freights are low,
business is improving. There is no shortage of
facilities, and at the moment it is not a factor
in our transportation problem.
The lake
Hon. Mr. McRAE.

shipping business is in private hands, and in
private hands it should be left until such
time as a comprehensive plan dealing with
our whole transportation problem is formed,
when, quite properly, our lake shipping might
very well be brought in as an integral part
of the whole scheme.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Now, there seems to
be a question as to who would pay any increase in freight rates. I think that was
cleared up pretty well yesterday. The price
of our wheat is determined by the Liverpool
market. The limited experience I have had
in the grain business indicates to me that
these rates are figured out closely. Charters
are obtained, port dues are considered, all
other distributions in connection with shipment are also taken into consideration, and
the grain is then handled on a very small
margin per bushel. Therefore any increase
in the freight rate at any point along the
line is taken off the price the farmer gets
at his primary point.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. McRAE: There is no question
about that. Business to-day is on such a
competitive basis that nobody can gain three
or four cents a bushel unless he goes into
the market and gambles in a wide-open way;
and then he will meet the fate of most
gamblers-he will lose out.

There is just one other factor that might
be mentioned in passing. If the Bill were to
become effective, the alternative route by
Buffalo would not be available for our wheat
destined to Great Britain. In other words,
our lake shipping would be a monopoly confined to the transportation companies now
operating from the head of the lakes to Montreal. I say frankly that then the farmer of
Western Canada would lose a considerable
portion of that six-cent preference which he
now enjoys in the British market.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I wonder if the
honourable gentleman would explain that point
a little further. I cannot understand how
the Western farmer would lose the preference in the British market as the honourable
gentleman suggests.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: If the farmer who grows
a bushel of wheat in Saskatchewan is paid
$1.50 for it in Liverpool, and the transportation of it costs him 25 cents, his net return
on the farm is $1.25. If the rates on the
lakes go up 5 cents a bushel, and it costs the
farmer 5 cents more to get that bushel of
wheat to Liverpool, he receives so much less
for it on the farm. Is that clear?

MARCH 18, 1937
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Does that cover the
alternative rate from Buffalo?
Hon. Mr. McRAE: No. Under the British
arrangement the alternative rate from Buffalo
cannot compete. Al that we can ship to-day
through the port of Buffalo is wheat destined
for countries other than Great Britain.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
member has not covered this point. I deny
that the Bill will have the effect of increasing
any rates on the Great Lakes and the St.
Lawrence.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Of course, the intention, I presume, is to put the Bill into operation to see how it works out. But what is
this Bill for if it is not to increase rates?
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Did the Minister not
tell us repeatedly that transportation rates on
the Great Lakes were too low and the lake
boats were insolvent? How are they going
to be restored to solvency-by goodwill or
by this legislation?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Minister
said he was not concerned at aIl about the
restoration of their solvency.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I have the
statement before me. He said he was not
concerned about restoring their solvency.
Regulation of railway rates has satisfied the
Western Provinces, but has not had the effect
of restoring solvency to the railways. The
West has benefited by low railway rates.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: We have no low rates.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: I think that question
is beside the issue. Let me deal with the
railways and point out how little benefit they
would get under this Bill.
In my opinion agreed rates should never be
put into effect. :If they are, they will be
very hurtful to the small producer. It is
even conceivable that agreed rates might
apply to the big shippers of grain, and certainly a man who grows one carload of grain
will not be content to pay a higher rate
than is paid by the man who grows a thousand carloads. I think, therefore, you can
wipe out agreed rates as a backward step.
Now I come to lake rates. I have no doubt
that some of the package freight business can
be restored to the railways, provided that
summer rates on the Great Lakes are made
high enough; but if they are, it will be too
bad for the consumers of Western Canada
who will have to pay the increase in the water
rates.

199

The principal potentiality of this Bill, in the
way of being helpful to the railways, was
mentioned last night, I think, by the honourable junior senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Haig). We have heard much criticism of the
railways in the past for not engaging in the
truck and bus business for their own protection. I say frankly that I do not concur in
that criticism. Nevertheless, if there is anything in that criticism, what is to be said
about the conduct of the railways, since the
Canadian Pacifie Railway was built, in letting
that great natural stream of freight, the grain
of Western Canada, get entirely out of their
hands, to be transported, as it is to-day, by
individual shipping companies after it is
delivered by the railway company at Fort
William? I can see many advantages that
would accrue from the railways' control of the
wheat movement from Port Arthur or Fort
William to Montreal or Liverpool. The railways could move the grain in such a way as
to suit their steamship movements best, without the overhead expenses which are so burdensome in the case of the small companies;
and there are many other advantages. Quite
apart from these considerations, the movement
of wheat by the railways from lake head to
Montreal or to European ports would help
them tremendously. If this Bill proposed
that the railway companies should take over
these bankrupt steamship lines at a reasonable
price and handle the grain through to Montreal, and much of it to Europe, I should say
it followed constructive lines. I would point
out to the honourable leader of the House
that when the Government comes to deal with
this whole transport problem that question
will be a very logical one to consider. If
the Bill does not provide for that, it means
nothing worth talking about, as far as our
railways are concerned. I am not sure that
my suggestion will be appreciated by the
Western members of this House, but I maintain that our railway companies lost a great
source of revenue when they allowed the grain
movement of the West to get out of their
hands before leaving the shores of this
country.
I think this Bill has served a very useful
purpose. There has been a great deal of discussion upon it, and much information has
been obtained which should be helpful in the
framing of a comprehensive bill respecting our
entire transportation problem. I hope we shall
have before us for consideration a real programme dealiing with the woof and web of the
whole transportation fabric, and that we shal
not be asked to play with the fringe of it.

been virtually tied up for years, and in some
cases they 'have had to sacrifice a great deal
of the interest to which they were entitled.

not make this digression; I ought to stick to
the Bill.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: As I was saying, the Bill is now before us, transformed
and beautified, or at least made passable.
In my opinion it bas one great merit:
it provides for a very excellent principle,
the regulation of rates. On this account
I am convinced it would be wise for this
House to let the Bill go through. We have
done what we could to improve it. If I am
right in considering that regulation of rates
is an excellent thing, why not let the measure
be sent to the other House, where it would
have a chance of being improved further
and passed, and then put into force and
tested by experience?
I do not know what the fate of the Bill
will be. On the one hand, I understand, the
Government feels a great deal of anxiety
with respect to the difficulties of putting this
excellent principle of regulation into practice.
Besides, to put it into practice may be
dangerous politically. I have been told that
there may be, therefore, a concealed hope
that the Senate may remove from the lap of
the Government a child that might later on
cause it a great deal of annoyance. On the
other hand there are people who will accept
no regulation whatsoever. Let us be frank.
The Bill is at the crossroadsHon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think my honourable friend is not quite right.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I may n'ot be.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend opposite (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) said that everyone was in favour
of the principle of regulation provided oneself
was not regulated.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Everyone
here.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That seems
to be a truism.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I am glad my honourable friend has reminded me of that fact.
But I do not think it changes at all the trend
of my argument, at least on this point. On
the one side there are the weight of responsibility and the fear of political consequences,
and on the other side the ever present desire
of some people to benefit, whether or not at
the expense of others. It may be that the
combination of these two sentiments will drive
this Bill to its finish in this House.
The system we have now is that of the
survival of the fittest. Do honourable senators
believe that is better, more desirable, than
regulation? That is the question I want to
put before this House. Under the system
of the survival of the fittest, dog eats dog.
That has gone on from the time of the caveman, and it has brought about untold misery
and innumerable bankruptcies. Everybody
knows that. Are we going to vote for a continuation of that system in transportation?
Some people say that we are not dbliged to
keep in existence those transportation agencies
which are unable to survive without regulation. It is said we should let them die. Well,
what would be the consequence? The law
of nature does not change. If we permit
the continuance of the old syster of the
survival of the fittest, dog will continue to eat
dog and in time the very few transportation
agencies which have been able to survive will
demand increased rates. In that process there
will be an unlimited amount of waste. What
will be the result of it all? Simply the placing of certain companies in a position where
they can exact excessive rates.
There is this further consideration. If capital
cannot find sufficient protection what will it
do? The West requires capital, and the East
has a great deal of sympathy for the West,
notwithstanding what bas been said by some
of my honourable friends. The East understands what the life of the pioneer means.
We have pioneers in the province of Quebec.
I think the life of the pioneer in Quebec is
rather harder than that of the pioneer in the
West, who finds his land cleared and is able
to put his plough into the ground the first
year he settles on his farm. In my province the

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
My honourable
friends of the West should try sometimes to
understand the feelings of the East. Think
of the thousands of people of small income
who took what little money they had, the
savings frorn long years of hard work, and
bought a few shares in railways or in transportation companies. Now they find their investments are going up in smoke.
I will come back to my proposition. On the
one side there is regulation, and on the other
side the system of the survival of the fittest,
under which dog eats dog. 'Do we want to
have a continuance of the waste that has
gone on in the past, or shall we do in Canada
what has been done elsewbere in the world,
that is, prevent excessively low rates as well
as excessively high rates?
But, honourable senators, let us get a little
bit closer to home. What about our railways? We are all in the railway business.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Some people say
this Bill would hardly affect the railways, so
far as wheat is concerned. What about package freight? Does anyone contend that is not
a very large item in railway transportation?
Would it not be wise for Parliament to give
some support to our own Canadian National
Railways and the Canadian Pacifie Railway,
both of which roads have been suffering
financially for years? My honourable friends
from the West say that this Bill would mean
nothing but an increased schedule of rates.
I deny that. What the railways ask for is a
fair tribunal and nothing else. They ask that
we apply to them what has been the ruie in
other intelligent nations. They ask us to do
here what is being donc in the United States.
A bill similar to the one now before us has
been given second reading in the American
Congress.
Our own railways have been regulated for
twenty-five or thirty years, but all transportation agencies competing against them have
been free. Is that fair? Why not, within the
ambit of this Bill, treat everyone in the same
way, subject all to the same regulation?
Would that not be fair. and wise also? How
can we manage to lift our railways from the
position in which they now lie unless we
bestir ourselves in some way?
Non. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

Our friends from the West seern to be afraid
of the Board of Transport Commissioners, as
the Railway Board will be known if the Bill
is passed. This will be my last point, and I
shall not be long on it.

Another transporta-

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I do not want my
honourable friends frorn the West to think
I have any grudge against them, but it seems
to me that an argument in favour of the
principle of this Bill should be addressed to
them. Let us look at the position of the
poor grain-growers. Under this Bill we are asking them to accept, not higher rates, but a
tribunal which will judge as to whether certain
rates can be put into effect. The graingrowers should be reminded of this fact.
Their grain which goes to Europe is carried
4,800 miles. For 3,600 miles of that distance
the transportation rates are regulated. It may
be that all grain-growers do not know this;
that some of them would be very much surprised to learn it. There are only 1,200 miles
of that transportation free of control, and all
we are asking our Western producers to do
is to agree to have regulated rates apply to
those 1,200 miles just as they already do to
three-quarters of the whole distance. All we
are asking is that the people of the West
submit to a fair and intelligent tribunal for
the regulation of rates.
But some people from the West will tell
me, "We do not want to run that risk, because if we do the rates will undoubtedly be
raised." Those who talk that way may not
have reflected that they are ýmaking a serious
admission. It is as though they said that
nothing can be done to right existing rates
except to raise them. According to that reasoning the rates are too low.
What tribunal will decide as to the rates?
It will be the Transport Board, the body now
known as the Railway Board. What has the
Railway Board done for grain-growers in
the past? That is a fair question. The Railway Board has been in existence for at least

lion. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I arn speaking about

that our Western farmers have the lowest

because what I say is true.

the rates.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I arn glad my hionourable friend bas said that, for I have a

rates in other countries are, as compared, with
those in Canada.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Wbere are these figures

lion. Mr. BEAUBIEN: They are random
railway statisties from "World Railway Statistics," 1936.
lion. Mr. CALDER: T-haf is good.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Cartainly if is good.
I arn bringing up this point because the
tribunal that the Western people refuse to
accept is the tribunal that has been rasponsible
for low rates in Canada. Let us sea what they
are. In Canada the population per mile of
line is 252, and the fraight revenue per tonmile is 95-5 cents. In the Unitad States, where
the population is so much greater than ours,
population per mile of line is 505. The freight
revenue per ton-mile in that country is $1.003.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Where is thaf charged?
lon. Mr. BEAIJBIEN: I arn falking of
the freight rates par ton-mile of the United
States as a whole, comparad wifh the freigbt
rates per ton-mile of Canada as a whole.
lion. Mr. CALDER: May I ramind the
honourable gentleman that a comparison of
that kind is not worth anything? You must
know the facts behind the comparison. You
must know the volume of frade, distances and
all that sort of thing. The mere bald stafement that over the whole of the United
States a certain rate is chargad doas flot mean
anytbing oomparatively.
Hon. Mr. BEAUIBIEN: I arn spaaking to
men who, I assuma, are accustomad to dealing
with stafisties. My honourabla friand should
know that this is an ordinary, reasonabla and
illuminating way of treating statistics. Why?
Because you take the factors that apply te
ratemaking. First of ail you taka the number of persons par mile of lina. If you have
twica the population par mile of lina you have
twice the traffle. So population is the fundamental factor. Let us sae whera Canada

Canada's; its freight revenue par ton-mile is
$2.910, or more than thrae timas -Canada's.
Garmany has a population par mile of lina
of 1,955, and ifs fraight revenue par ton-mile

2,955, and ifs fraight revenue par ýton-mile is

population par mile of lina is 1,547, and its
freight revenue par ton-mile is $2 306-about

revenue par ton-mile is 82-3 cents-the only
exception, the freight revenue par ton-mile
being lowar than in Canada. The axplanation
is simple to anyone familiar with the scale of
indu.strial wages ini that counfry. Japanesa
labour, according to, our standards, is paid
but a baggarly rate. Ausfralia's dansity of
population par mile of line is 250, about the
samae as Canada's, but there the freight
revenue par ton-mile is $2-512-naarly fhrae

a very high ratio of revenue to population,

Argantina's population par mile of lina is 520,
about twice ours, and ifs fraight revenue par

Hon. Mr. KING: -I was under the impression that be desired to exercise a privilege

However, it would seem that be has been
more or less carried away by his own eloquence: I think he has missed his train. But
I am glad; to learn that he intends to remain
and support the principle of the Bill, which
he says is good.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. KING: If that is so, my retirement in his favour has been of some advantage.
I think his statement should guide us in this
debate. Should the principlie embodied in this
Bill be adoptedý for the advantage of the
people of Canada? Experience in our own
business affairs would indicate that that principle has been proved to be effective in dealing with one of our greatest transportation
problems. When the Railway Commission
was established the railways objected to regulation and control of rates, but, as we were
informed by gentlemen who appeared before
the Railway Committee, the railways ultimately acknowledged that the application of
the principle had been of advantage not only
to themselves, but to the people of Canada
generally.
This being so, why should that principle
of regulation not be applied' to the other
modes of transportation that have sprung up
in recent years? In the days of the horse and
buggy the railways had no occasion to worry
about competition, but within the last twentyfive years the rapid development of truck
and bus traffic has very materially affected railway transportation throughout this country.
This condition is not peculiar to Canada, but
is world-wide, and I do not believe any
public man or anyone engaged in transportation to-day would suggest for a moment that
Parliament should' undertake to curb these
new transportation facilities. Aind, indeed,
that is not the object of the Bill. No one can
argue convincingly that those engaged' in
truck and bus traffic should not be subject
to some control with a view to uniformity of
rates and practices not only in any province,
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

but throughout the Dominion. That is the
principle underlying this Bill.
True, by
reason of constitutional difficulties we have
not been able to advance as far as we should
like in the control of motor-truck and bus
traffic, but we are trying to make a beginning.
I remember that in 1903 I moved a resolutien in this Chamber suggesting that the
Federal Government call together a committee composed of officers of the Fed'eral
Government and of the provincial governments, of the railway companies and the motor
transport companies, and of others engaged
in various formas of transportation. The right
honourable leader opposite (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen), who was then leading this Chamber,
told me be thought that a committee of the
Senate might very well be formed' to discuss
the resolution and see if something could not
be donc. The then Minister of Railways
stated, in another place, that the matter was
being canvassed between the provincial governments and the Federal Government, and
questionnaires had, been sent out. Thereupon I told the right honourable gentleman
that probably it would be better to let the
federal Minister and the representatives of
the provincial governments arrange matters,
if it could be done.
At that time a similar committee was
functioning in the United States. It included
in its membership representatives of the
Federal Government and the various state
governments, the railways, the motor transportation interests and, the automobile companies. That committee made a report. It
was adoptedi by the United States Government, and to-day there is in the United States
a form of control, both intrastate and federal,
and that control is working to the advantage
not only of the truck and bus traffic, but
also of transportation facilities generally.
Such, I think, is the object of the Minister
of Transport in sponsoring this Bill. He desires to apply as far as possible this broad
principle of regulation. No honourable member will contend that these public transportation utilities should be allowed te run wild.
My honourable friend fron Saltcoats (Hon.
Mr. Calder) stated in our Railway Committee
that we were going to correct what was formerly known as jitney competition. That is
true. It is admitted that we cannot advance as
far in that direction as we should like to go.
Personally I should like to see the Federal
Government step in and take over the provincial highways from Halifax or Sydney to
Vancouver or Alberni, on Vancouver Island,
and consolidate them into a national highway, and at the same time, in conjunction
with the provinces, take in certain designated

MARCH 18, 1937
feeders. Thus they would secure an effective
highway control which is not possible under
this Bill because of provincial jurisdiction.
In my opinion, if such an arrangement could
be reached it would enure to the great advantage of the provinces.
I believe the day will come when the
Federal Government will have to move along
the line indicated, and in doing so it would
be only following the practice of other countries. It has been done already in the United
States. Only a few days ago Great Britain
took over some 3,000 or 4,000 miles of county
roads and constituted them national highways.
The same sort of thing has been done in
Germany and France. I repeat, some day
our Federal Government will of necessity have
to take similar action for the accommodation
of the people of this Dominion. In this way
we shall eventually bring about unified control of road transportation.
But all this Bill seeks to do is to secure
control of interprovincial and international
road traffic. That is as far as the Minister
is prepared to go. Indeed, he cannot go
further at the present time. He has told
the Railway Committee that he does not
intend to interfere in any way with provincial
rights. If we pass this Bill we shall have
done something to bring this great public
utility to a certain .extent under federal control, and it will have the effect of bringing
about more uniform conditions throughout
Canada in regard to highway traffic.
I am not a member of the Railway Committee, but I attended many of its sessions
and listened to the arguments advanced for
and against the Bill. Yesterday some of my
honourable friends opposite said that, except
the representatives of the railways, nobody
appeared before the committee in favour of
the Bill. That was not my observation.
Representatives of three shipping companies
engaged in running regular package freight
schedules on the lakes gave evidence. At the
outset they said they were opposed to regulation. Two weeks later they came back and
said, "We have gone into this matter very
carefully and 75 per cent of us are in favour
of the regulation proposed in the Bill."

205

situation to-day unprofitable contracts were
being made and the business was being destroyed. The committee was also informed that
if the jitney or cut-throat competition continued on the Great Lakes the shipping companies would become bankrupt. If we accept
that statement, may we not assume that if
those companies become bankrupt the business will be reorganized? But it will be
reorganized not on a bankrupt basis, but on
a basis for profit.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Higher rates.
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes, higher rates, if necessary. If any honourable member thinks the
business oan be run on a bankrupt basis he is
out of touch with modern shipping conditions. As I say, in the event of bankrutpey
the business will be reorganized for profit. This
being so, why should not those engaged in the
carriage of our wheat be controlled, just as our
railways are controlled? Why should they not
agree to carry this great natural product at
agreed rates? My honourable friend from
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae) says that to
adopt the principle of agreed rates is simply
to go back to the Dark Ages. The agreed rate
is probably the maximum rate to be established. The maximum rate is known.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: No, no.

Hon. Mr. KING: Just a moment. I want to
make this clear. What my honourable friend
from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae) had in
mind was this: that the large producer could
go to a railway company and say, "I want
to move a large quantity of timber, and I
want a special rate," and an agreed rate
could be given to him. But once it was given
it would become applicable to every man engaged in that business. It is a published rate;
it is known. The agreed rate on the lakes
should not cause any great apprehension in
this House or in the House of Commons. It
will be a rate regulated under the authority of
the Transport Commission.
We heard yesterday a great outcry about
what was going to happen the wheat farmer.
I remember that in 1923 or 1924, when wheat
was selling at $1.50 or $2 a bushel, there
companies arose on the Great Lakes a situation in which

MARCH 18, 1937
I realize that our railways are in a very
serious condition. We should be very glad
to assist in any way that would improve their
financial condition. But there is such a thing
as the march of time. I come from the
county of Bruce, and I remember when there
was not a single line of railway in that
county. In order that the grain grown by
the early settlers might be sent to the markets,
docks and wharves were built at various

called Inverhuron was well built up. It had
docks, mills and storehouses; it was a thriving village. But when the railways came in
and transported the grain, that village was
naturally wiped out. To-day it is covered
by drifting sand. The people who invested
their money in that hamlet for the purpose
of shipping grain lost all their investment as
a result of the march of time. After that we
had the age of buggies, democrats and cutters.
Large factories were built up all over Western
Ontario for the purpose of constructing these
vehicles. To-day they are just empty buildings. The people who invested their money
in those plants have lost it. We must not
expect to realize on all the investments we
make. Progress, which we cannot stop, will
prevent us from doing so.
The great improvement that has been made
in the building of motor trucks and the construction of highways has had the effect of
taking a great deal of the freight traffic from
the railways. To my mind that share of the
traffic will increase rather than decrease as
time goes on, and the Parliament of Canada
might just as well enact legislation providing
that in the future the St. Lawrence river
shall flow west as think seriously that by
legislation it can stop the development of
progress.
Aside from these objections to the Bill there
is another one. It has long been my opinion
that different parliaments of Canada-both
parties are responsible-have placed on the
Statute Book what is called paternal legislation, which has interfered with those who
desired to carry on business. Various forms
of social legislation have had the effect of
depriving our people of their proper initiative
and self-reliance. I remember the time when
a young man went out into the world with
the idea that he had to make good or go
under. By passing paternal legislation we
have destroyed the ambition of our people,
and to-day many young men go out into
the world with the idea that it does not matter
whether they make good or not, because if they
do not the Government will provide them a
living. I am strongly opposed to paternal
legislation, one form of which is to be found
in this Bill.

Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members, I have made three attempts to rise, and
now that I am on my feet I am going to
stay. I have no desire to catch a train, but
I wish to occupy your time for a brief period
-and when I say "brief" I mean brief.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE:

Train or no train.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: I think we are all
agreed as to the importance of this measure.
In my opinion it is the most important Bill
to come before Parliament this session. I
think at this stage we can all agree that there
is a very wide difference of opinion as to what
should be done with the Bill. The Bill itself
is full of difficulties and complexities; it is
puzzling in many ways; and all who took part
in the committee realized that the problem
we had to deal with was not an easy one.
Eventually the Bill was moved out of committee and reached this House, and now we
must finally dispose of it.
Since the House adjourned yesterday I took
the trouble to make a fairly extensive analysis
of the problem now confronting this House,
and I intended to submit that analysis to
you; but for purely personal reasons I no
longer have that intention, nor do I think
I should attempt to make any extended
address at this time.
So far as the main object of the Bill is
concerned, I may say that I am in entire
sympathy with it. I say that without any
reservation whatsoever. I believe in the control of rates. But because I believe in the
control of rates it does not necessarily follow
that I must agree to the control of rates in
every field. A man may believe in that
principle as applied to certain public facilities and services, but his belief in it does not
compel him to believe that it is opportune,
advisable or necessary to apply the principle
to other public services.
The Bill before us has been shorn of many
features, and there are but two things left
to be considered by this House. The proposed
legislation as it came to us was very broad
in its scope and application. The Bill we now
have is different. In my opinion the only
two things left to be considered at this time
are, first, the control of shipping on the Great
Lakes, and, second, the agreed contracts provided for in the Bill, such as are now and
have been for some three years in force in
Great Britain.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

That is in the

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes, it is in the Bill.
But I mean that any difference of opinion
existing among ourselves applies to only two
points in the Bill. As to highways, the Minister himself said Le would not bring the Bill
into operation even so far as Dominion highways were concerned, nor with regard to interprovincial and international traffic, unless it
was agreed by the provinces that he should
exercise rate control over their highways.
There is no use in talking about those parts
of the measure upon which there is agreement; so I say there remain only two points
which we are called upon to consider at the
present time. The first is the proposed control over shipping on the Great Lakes, and
the second is the proposed use here of a
system which Las been in use in Great Britain
for some three years.
I have already stated that so far as the
main object of the Bill is concerned I am
in complete sympathy with it. Now, I believe
that the Minister's intention and in a sense
his conception with regard to the Bill were
right. But new Ministers are always very
busy; they are crowded every minute of the
day. They are not accustomed to the things
that usually happen in governmental business,
for the worries of the private business man
are different from those of the Minister. I
think the Minister of Transport was too busy
to consider the provisions of this Bill as they
should have been considered, and also that Le
Lad not at his elbow the necessary legal
experts to give him proper advice on the
matter. We have evidence to support this
view.
The manner in which, time after
time, the Minister freely accepted amendments
proposed in the committee indicates that in
the Bill were provisions which would never
have been there at all if Le had been properly
advised. Take the provision regarding coastal
shipping, for instance. It was promptly deleted.
Take the provision that would have affected
chips whose traffic originates in the Maritimes
and whieh year in and year out carry their
eargoes up into the Great Lakes. That, too,
is gone. There was even a provision whereby
the Minister would take control over all ships
propelled by any means other than oars. That
was absolutely silly.
Hon. Mr. DUFF:
lion. Mr. CALDER.

You are right.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: I say that while the
intention back of the Bill was good, the
Minister did not have the necessary time nor
advice to be able to put the Bill into the
shape in which it should have been. What
is the situation now? There is a very strongly
divided opinion. What is the attitude of the
West? We must liook to that. I think the
honourable junior senator from Winnipeg
(Ho.n. Mr. Haig) is correct. From the Great
Lakes to the mountains you will find no
public opinion in faveur of this Bill. Is
Parliament going to jam the measure through
both Houses contrary to that public opinion?
I doubt the wisdom of doing that.
We are told that there is now before the
United States Congress a bill similar to this
proposal so far as lake traffic is concerned.
What knowledge have we as to what that
measure will contain if it is ever passed?
None at all. It is admitted that any power
of control which we propose to give under
this Bill would not be worth the snap of a
finger unless the Americans came in and cooperated with us in the exercise of that control, andt at this moment we have no assurance
at all as to whether that American bill will
pass, nor as to the measure of control which
will result from it if it is passed.
Let me refer now to the part of the Bill
providing for agreedi charges. If there was
one feature which gave me more concern than
another it was the possible effect of this part,
if actually put into force. The committee
had before it nothing worthy of the name
of evidence to show Low the agreed, charges
system Las been working out in Great Britain,
where it was adopted two or three years ago.
It is quite true that we had a statement by
representatives of railways, and one or two
cables were received from persons in the Old
Country. But had we a single bit of testimony from any person familiar with the facts
as to how the scheme is actually operating in
Great Britain? We had not. Therefore we
Lad no opportunity of cross-examining any
person familiar with the facts. But it is
argued: "Oh, well, the system Las been in
force over there two or three years. Let us
try it out." I think this House and the
other House are entitledi to a little more than
that. Once the fact that the British have
adopted this system was brought to our
attention in the committee we shouldi, I
think, have Lad called before us some wellinformed, witnesses frem
England. Then
there would have been real evidlence as te
the actual situation in the Old! Country te
assist us in passing judgment upon this feature.

MARCH 18,1-937
So far as I personally arn concerned>-I arn
speaking frankly-I believe in control of rates
and I dio hope that some scheme wiIl be
worked out whereby the shipping situation
on the Great Lakes can be greatly improved.
1 have to admit that I do not know how that
cau be donc. That is not my business. But
my view is, without any reservation, that the
Government would be well advised, aven in
its own interest, mot to press this matter at
present. 1 do not say the idea behind the
Bilil should ha dropped, but I repeat that we
in this Chamber have flot had before us the
necessary facts te ens.ble us te pass proper
judgment on what should be dionc with regard
to tha t;wo features that are left for us ta consîdar, the control of shippîng on the Lakes and
the provisions respecting agreed charges.
I do flot like to oppose the Bill. I should
he glad if the ot-her House could have an
opportunity of analysing it, but I fear there
wauld flot be tirne for it to do that if the
session must end early enough to permit
eur parliamentary representatives to reach
Bngland in time for the Coronation.
[t
seems to me that t;he wisest course for the
Government to pursue, in the circumstances,
is just to Jet the measure stand over for a
while. In the meantime we could digest it
more fully and t;he Minister and his associates
would be able to give further consideration
to the proposais t-hat are being mada. What
is the situation just now? My honourable
friend from Koot;enay Bust (Hon. Mr. King)
intirnated there was some support for this
Bill. Where does it corne from? From haif
a dozen or ten or one hundred persons parhaps?
Hon. Mr. KING: Many more.
support of public opinion.

It has the

Hon. Mr. CALDER: We have had no cvidence ef that, but we have had a superabundance of evidence that there is no real
public support for the Bill.
Hon. Mr. KING: It is opposed by those
who are uncontrolled to-day and want to
remain uncontrolled.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Do you mean te say
that merchants in Montreal, Winnipeg, Toronto and other cities, and boards of trade,
representing ail classes of people in business
who, would be affected by higher package
freiglit ratesHon. Mr. KING: That is flot proven.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That is what they
say and fear. Do you mean t;o say ail these

20U

for granted that the whole merchant class,
and in turn the consuming class, are opposed
ta the Bill.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: What about the provinces, too?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: So far as the people
of Western Canada are concerned I have
only to refer to t'he attitude of Mr. Dafoe.
I have been acquainted with hîm for thirtyfive or forty years and I know hirn intimately.
Hae is an outst;anding Westerncr, a man of
high character and integrity, one who has
exceptionally good knowledge of Western
public opinion. Whcn John Dafoe says tha
people of the West are absolutely and totally
opposed to this Bill, 1 cannot help believing
hie knows wbat hie is talking about. I repeat
that our Railway Committea had no evidence of any material public opinion in favour
of the measure. Yet we are asked to pass it.
That is not fair to us nor to Parliament nor
to the public. I do hope the Govarnment
will reconsider the situation. In view of the
short time that rernains before prorogation, I
arn convinced it would be wise to hold the
measure back for further consideration.
Hon. A. MARCOTTE: Honourabla senators, I will not take up much tima. I may
say that 1 had prepared a considerable argument with a view to showing that Weste-rn
farmers had avary reason to baliave they
wcre going te be inWued once more, but
owing to admissions made by the honourabla
senator frorn Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien)
and the honourable sanator from Kootenay
East (Hon. Mr. King) I think it is lot, nacassary for me to present the whola of rny
argument. They conceded that the effeet of
the measure would be to increasa freight rates
on the Lakes. That is whera the fariners are
concerned. In order to place on Hansard
some reasons for our fears I arn going to raad
part of a letter which was read before the
Railway Committea and appears at page 40
of the proceadings. The letter is signed by
George S. Mathieson, Secretary of the Shippers and Exportars Committea of the Winnipeg Grain Exchange. It says:
Lake transportation has been daveloped ovar
a long period of tima under a competitiva
systemn based on supply and darnand conditions.
Rates have bean dependent in a large measure
on the supply of grain available for transport,
on the character of the freight, on the posaibility of raturn cargoes, on the time raquired
to completa loading, transport and d-ischarge,
on the pariod of the year and chimatie conditions, and on the size, charactar and quantity
of the tonnage available. Rates are also
dependent on international competitive conditions on the lakes, such as movemant of grain
front Canadian ports ta, Amarican ports for

SENATE

transhipment from these ports in bond to either
Canadian or American seaboard, and to competition to some extent with ocean tonnage
out of Pacifie ports and Churchill and via
smaill direct tramp ocean vessels.
Such licensing and regulation of tolls as proposed would seriously interfere with the frce
movement of Canadian grain, with the adequate
adjustment of rates to meet continually changing conditions, would tend towards monopoly
and to an increase in the cost of lake transportation of Canadian grain to the detriment
of the producers of Western Canada, and be
the means of diverting considerable traffie tn
other channels to the detriment of Canadian
lake carriers.
This summarizes very well the arguments of
the Western farmers in opposition to the Bill.
It bas been said that the Bill was ill conceived and badly prepared. There is good
reason for making that statement. We have
it from the lips of the Minister of Transport
himself. In a speech on "Transportation
Problems" which he made before the Canadian
Club of Ottawa on February 20, copies of
which speech were distributed to members
of the Railway Committee, he said:
I am quite ready tn admit that the subject
I suggested for to-day's discussion is a very
large one. My discussion of it will be tempered
by the fact that I have been in contact with it
for only a short time and really know very
little about it.
He gave us proof of that when he came before
the committee. Time after time ho was willing to eliminate this or that provision from
his own Bill.
We have been asked tn vote for this Bill
by two honourable senators who say the control of rates would he good for the whole
of Canada. But when Mr. Guthrie, Chairman
of the Railway Board, was asked for bis
opinion, this is what he said:
But my view is that if you are going to
control rates you must make the control applicable throughout; otherwise it will be piecemeal,
and discrimination is bound to crop up.
That is to be found at page 374 of the committee's proceedings.
Now, honourable senators, are we in favour
of legislation that would discriminate between
different parts of the country, and to the
advantage of some forms of transportation as
against others? Are we going to pass a measure
that would discriminate especially against the
West? I do not think the Senate will do
that. So far as I am concerned, for the reasons I have given I shall vote against the Bill.
Hon. J. H. RAINVILLE: Honourable senators, this Bill embodies two principles, one
good, the other objectionable. The first principle deals with the inspection of public conveyances, boats, aeroplanes and motor vehicles
to ensure safety, hygienic conditions, and the
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE.

protection of perishable freight. This inspection, however, is already provided for under
existing legislation, both federal and provincial.
The objectionable principle is that which,
if applied, would empower the Minister,
through a board, to assign routes or territories
to public licensed conveyances. It is evident
that the Bill is intended to protect certain
interests, either the Great Lakes shipping
companies or the railways, for the application of this principle is tantamount to giving
a free right of way to individuais or companies
in order that they may establish transportation lines without competition.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: May I ask
my honourable friend, is not that the principle
adopted in Ontario in relation to necessity
and convenience?
The provincial authority
hears applicants and, if satisfied, grants licences
to operate along certain highways. That, I
think, is on the principle of necessity and
convenience.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: It does not affect
my argument at ail. To-day the railways enjoy such a privilege, but they exercise it on
their own right of way. By this Bill the
use of rivers and canals belonging to the
State would be granted free to certain companies or individuals, and their earnings would
be assured by the Transport Board fixing
freight rates. In fixing the rates, no doubt,
consideration would be given not only to
cost of transportation, but also to a fair profit
on the capital invested. This would have
the effect of creating a privileged class in
the transportation business. In my opinion
it would be equivalent to what obtains already
under provincial jurisdiction with regard to
our electric power trusts, which secure rights
to develop waters powers belonging to the
public domain.
It is, I believe, a principle generally admitted
that the most effective way to reduce prices
is by competition. This Bill would destroy
competition. I am afraid, therefore, that if
it were enacted we should, within a few years,
have transportation organized under a powerfui trust or combine, which no Government
would be able or willing to control, any more
than our provincial governments have been
able to control the inflation policies of our
power, our pulp and paper and our textile
companies. In my view it is a vicious principle and, if adopted, would lead eventually
to the nationalization of our entire transport
services. Recalling the Canadian National
Railway deficits, I for one should not like
to sec any further incursion into the realm of
public ownership.

MARCH 18, 1937
It is no surprise to me to find such general
opposition to the Bill frorn all parts of the
country. This opposition has come not only
from private companies, but also from public
bodies. I am astonished that in the face of
this general opposition the Government should
insist on the passage of the Bill.
Under the Bill the Minister of Transport
seeks power to control shipping rates. In
this connection I may be permitted ta give
one or two examples of regulation of harbour
tolls and wharfage rates. The harbour of
Montreal, in common with our other national
harbours, has a tariff of tolls, which is approved by the Governor in Council. This
tariff is revised annually, and covers every
kind of merchandise. In 1932 a prominent
citizen of Montreal, a member of the Shipping Federation of Canada, told the Harbour
Commissioners that if they would reduce by
a few cents the tolls on manganese ore, he
would be able ta divert to Montreal the
immense traffic which at that time was going
through the port of New York.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Were those the freight or
the wharfage rates?
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: The wharfage
rates. I was a member of the Harbour Board.
We applied to the Minister here for permission to change our tariff. I believe application ta the Minister would be more expeditious than the method of applying to the
Railway Commission, as provided by this Bill.
Three months elapsed before we received an
answer from Ottawa refusing our request, and
we lost the business.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: In 1932 Sir Alexander Gibb made a survey of our national
ports. In his report be stresses the importance of flexibility in fixing tolls and freight
rates. Allow me ta quote from his report:
156. In the busy years of 1926, 1927 and 1928,
delays were experienced by all classes of transport, except liners. At that time the delays
to lake boats alone were estimated ta cost one
cent per bushel of grain, that is to say, 10 per
cent to 15 per cent of the total freight rate
ta Montreal.
In the last three years delays have not fallen
on the ocean shipping or railways so much as
on the lake boats. Actually, during the 1931
season the daily average number of canal boats
tied up in the harbour, with full cargoes, was
35; the average time spent by each boat before
unloading started was 12 days; and at one time
the delay amounted te over 60 days.
158. Profits in the lake freighter business
depend on the number of journeys that can be
secured in the comparatively short season. In
ordinary circumstances the round voyage from
head of lakes ta Montreal and back probably
takes about 15 days, and the number of voyages
that a lake freighter might make in a good
31117-14J

211

season would be about 15. At the extremely
low rates that prevailed throughout 1931, it is
probable that expenses could barely be earned
even with the minimum of delay at either end;
and delays such as have been regularly experienced at Montreal must cripple the profitable
working of the lake traffie. In the interests of
the Canadian lake shipping, as welI as the
whole trade therefore, any avenue that might
lead ta the improvement of the position should
be carefully explored.
160. The real difficulty, so far as the lake
and canal fleet is concerned, is that it is far
in excess of present requirements. About 40
vessels could easily have carried the 70,000,000
bushels that came down by water in 1929,
whereas there were more than four times that
number engaged. In 1930, practically the same
amount of canal tonnage was operating into
Montreal as in the peak year of 1928.
Since Sir Alexander Gibb made his report
all the charges of the port of Montreal and
the other national ports have been virtually
doubled. We had built up for the port of
trade in
a very considerable
Montreal
molasses. Recently a man has been giving
ta the local papers interviews in which he
says that on account of the greatly increased
port and shipping rates he will be obliged
ta take his business ta the port of Albany.
If we had flexibility in fixing our rates we
could retain that trade for the port of Montreal.
The honourable senator from Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. McRae) put his finger on, the real
trouble in the lake shipping business: there
are too many boats. His good judgment is
confirmed by Sir Alexander Gibb's opinion
which I have already quoted. As will be
observed Sir Alexander Gibb has never
suggested the adoption of the principle embod'ied in this Bill te solve the problem of
our boats. In 1932 the shipping companies
were complaining of delay. What could have
been done to meet that situation? In my
view there was only one remedy: ta increase
the grain elevator capacity at the port of call
of ocean navigation. For ten yeamrs we have
asked, for that increased grain storage, and
we have been supported by all the public
bodies in Montreal and by the ports of Saint
John, Halifax and Quebec, but we have not
yet been able ta get any satisfaction from
the Government.
Some honourable members apparently believe that by raising the shipping rates on the
Great Lakes we should be helping the railways. To the uninitiated this may seem
good enough, but we know that it does not
apply to conditions in Canada. Canada is
not Holland' or Italy. Canada is an enormous
country, extending for 4,000 miles from the
Pacific ta the Atlantic, and with only a small
population. We have two transcontinental
railways and the most wonderful inland water-

SENATE
way in the world. We should remember that
first we built canals to fill the need of a slow,
cheap form of transport. The railways came
after, offering a fast service at a higher cost.
Because of the geographical nature of the
country the railway systems and the waterways
are not antagonistic ta one another, and do
not clash in any way. On the contrary, they
-are beneficial and supplementary one to the
other. Passengers, express and fast freight
will use the railways; heavy and, bulk freight,
if it is to move at all in our country, will
have to make use of both rail and water.
No grain would, move east from Fort William
to Montreal, New York, Saint John, Halifax
or Quebec, if it were not for the lake carriers.
The rate would' be prohibitive. The low water
rate is what enables Canadian grain to compete with grain of any other country in the
world. If it were not for the St. Lawrence
river we could not have Nova Scotia coal in
Ontario. It could not compete against the
coal of the United States. We tried two or
three years ago to bring Alberta coal into
Ontario, but the attempt was a complete
failure; it ceould not succeed unless the railway
companies were subsidized.
Let me quote as an authority no less an expert than Mr. Chauncey Depew, President of
the New York Central Railway. As everybody knows, that road is paralleled by waterways for the entire distance from New York
to Chicago. In giving evidence before the
United States Senate Committee in 1875, Mr.
Depew used these words:
There is a feeling that the railways are
hostile to the waterways. I want to say that
is not true.
There has always been a feeling
that the New York Central was hostile to the
Erie canal. I should regard it as a great
calamity if the Erie canal ceased to be operated as it is. Personally I voted for a free
canal. The Erie canal forced to New York an
immense traffie we ordinarily get; we get the
surplus that cornes by lake to Buffalo seeking
the canal. I am speaking as a New York
Central man now. Whatever helps New York
helps the New York Central road. The Erie
canal helps New York, and therefore we are in
favour of the Erie canal.
I say, in consequence, that whatever will
help Montreal, Toronto or any big city in our
country, will help the Canadian Pacific and
the Canadian National.
I have also the opinions of Sir Henry
Thornton, Lord Shaughnessy, the Duff Commission, and Sir Alexander Gibb again. As
the honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. 'McRae) has said, we should like to see
someone tackle this problem of the railways.
I for one would support any drastic measure
that would help in settling that problem; but
I claim that not only are we not helping the
railways by fixing water rates, but we are
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE.

getting less of the east-bound traffic and are
running the risk of helping our American
friends to carry more wheat and other commodities from Canada through American
channels. This traffic alone, according to one
authority that I have, is bringing to the railways and canal boats of the United States,
and to the different harbours in the form aof
dues, more than $20,000,000 a year which
should be expended for the benefit of all the
ports of Eastern Canada.
Confederation was based upon east-andwest transportation, and cheap transportation
is the best means of uniting East and West.
I do not know whether the Hon. Mr. Rogers
has studied this Bill, but the other day, the
2nd of March of this year, to be exact, I read
in the Montreal Gazette a report of a speech
by him in which he used these words:
Clearing the channels of trade rather than
a rigorous policing of business is the policy
of the present Government.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: He made a
bad slip there.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: Imposing rates
is not the way to clear trade channels in
Canada, and I am sure that in voting against
this Bill I am voting for the principle voiced
by Mr. Rogers himself.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
to hear him reply to that.

I should like

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I desire to place on record
in what is perforce a very brief space of time
mv reasons for the vote which I shall give.
When this Bill first came before the House
I made a promise to the Government in
the House that I would view it sympathetically and treat it throughout in the same spi-rit.
I think that up to now I have donc so, and I
do not think any other opinion of my attitude can logically be taken from what I shall
say here at the last.
The reason I felt as I did was that I knew
there were evils to be cured, inequities to be
removed. I knew the situation of very important concerns was exceedingly difficult, and
to find a way of remedying the inequities,
removing the inequalities and restoring if
possible some sort of reasonable prosperity
to deserving companies was an object well
worth while.
I have seen in a paper published in the city
of Ottawa an article written by a gentleman
who certainly has not given to this subject as
much study as have members of the cornmittee, and who, in my judgment, does not
know the spirit of this House. In this article
he said this Bill would be passed unless the
Conservative majority in the Senate decided

MARCH 18, 1037
to play politics and defeat it. I say ta that
paper and ta that writer the staternent I have,
referred to is an impudent insuit. I do
nlot know of any party spirit at ail in this
flouse in relation ta this Bill, and I know
that ever since entering this flouse I have
sought ta use my influence against the manifestation of such a spirit an any occasion.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Anyane who
has followed aur debate up ta the present
wiIl have seen that an this question there is
noa uniformity af view an this side of the
flouse. 1 do loit think there is unifarmity
on the Cther side. Indeed, it might be surmised from the speech of at least one honourable gentleman who sits pretty nearly
opposite, and Who is my personal friend, that
he had grave daubts as to whetber I was
orthodox about this question, and indeed he
was uncertain how the die wauld be cast.
I have had sorne difficulty in. caming ta a
decision. I have had na difficulty, however,
after a week or two of listening to evidence
and thoroughly trying ta measure the merits
of the Bill, in coming ta a conclusion as ta
whether it is in the public interest that the
Bill should pass. Perhaps it is just as well ta
say now what that conclusion is; nlot that
I think it is of any mare importance than
the conclusion af anyone else. I do flot think
it is in the public înterest that the Bill should
pass-and I have not thought so for several
weeks. The reason for my difficulty was
this. I think this House should be very
hesitant ta defeat a Government measure introduced in the Senate, and thus ta prevent
that measure from. reaching the Chamber
known, and properly knawn, as the popular
Chamber. It is my feeling that only in exceptional cases should such action be taken.
Though thiaroughly decided in my own
mind against the Bill itseli, I supported and
asked others ta support the motion, ta report
the Bill iror cammittee. I think it wauld
havebeen entirely wrang nat ta do so, but ta
allow the Bill ta die in committee. It shauld
be dealt with in this Chamber.
Many a time a messure ai the present
Government or af the lust Government has
been allowed ta pase in the Senate without
opposition although a large section at lest
of the members of the flouse would have
voted against it if they had only dealt with
it according ta their belief as ta the merits af
the measure. Such was the case under the
late Government: irequently measures were
submitted ta this flouse and unanimously supported, little criticism being made and no vote

213

taken. The conduct ai the Opposition in that
regard has been followed by the Opposition
under the present Administration, althaugh it
is in a considerable majority in this Chamber.
This, I think, is the proper course in the case
af ahl measures which are merely a reflection
of the Government's method ai dealing with
an administrative matter. I had no faith in,
but was definitely opposed ta, the plan of
shifting the unemplayment problem ai Canada ta a commission, but I did nlot ask that
the measure be deieated here, nar did I even
vote against it. That, it seemed ta me, was
something as ta which the Government should
have a free chaice, and as ta which it should
abide by the cansequence af ifs chaice. The
function ai the TJpper flouse wus criticism and
improvement ai the measure.
Now, in view ai ane's opinion that we
should be most careful about deieating a
measure introduced here, is it passible that
one should be so opposed ta a measure as ta
advise ifs defeat? I arn ai opinion that this
is a measure ai major consequence and that
a vote of this flouse in its favour would be
regarded by the country as the considered
judgment of the Senate af Canada after it
had heard evidence for weeks and weighed
ail arguments adrvanced. This measure is
of such paramaunt cansequence that I do
not feel justifled in ranging myseli with those
wha would permit the Bill ta pass. As te
that judgment, I have made it clear in con.
versation, and I want ta state naw in the
most public way, that I arn asking no one,
for party reason. or any other such reason, ta
vote as I do in this matter. The liberty of action
ai every honourable senatar is equal ta mine,
and I amn quite certain ail will exercise that
liberty. I personally do nat want ta be
understood in this country as having put my
support behind a mesisure ai this consequence
and helpcd ta place the Senate in such a
position that it could be said ta have came
ta an affirmative conclusion after hearing the
evidence.
Now I proceed ta a very brief argument
an the evidence, and I arn afraid ifs brevity
will impair its adequacy. The Bill seeks ta
remove difficulties and inequahities under which
certain very important concerns ai bis country labour. Some people take the view that
because these concerns are big they are vested,
and that therefore it is a virtue ta hit them.
I have suffered much because ai that line of
attack, for I have been accused ai being iriendly
ta them when ail I desired was ta do what
I thouglit was best for the Dominion. I will
neyer range myscîf with those who attack any
bill from that standpoint. I do not think

214

SENATE

the Minister has any motive with respect to
this measure except to cure difficulties that
exist.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: My reason
for opposing the Bill is that I think he is
moving along wrong lines to cure those difficulties. Our railways undoubtedly are now
subject te a disability which is net only very
onerous, but very unfair. Tbey have not
the freedom of action which their competitors
enjoy. One phase of the Bill seeks something
of that freedom of action for them, so that
they may be able te carry on competition
under terms of equality. They are entitled
te that freedom of action if we can give it to
them. It is more important in the case of the
private railway than in the case of the public
railway. The private railway rests upon its
own base, it bas to fight its own battle, whereas the public railway charges its losses up
to the Treasury of Canada.
It is important to this country net only
that the railways have a fair deal, but also
that there be sone sort of fairness on our
Great Lakes if by justifiable measures we can
bring that about. I do not think it is much in
the line of common sense to describe shipping
interests on the Great Lakes as vested interests. What is vcsted about them? They
are bankrupt. Someone disputed that. But
does anyone know of a Great Lakes company
of any size which is not bankrupt to-day?
The honourable senator from Kootenay East
(Hon. Mr. King) said they could net go on
if they were bankrupt. Why, they are going
on. The biggest one of them bas net paid
its bond interest since-I cannot remember
when. But it is operating. It would lose
more by stopping than it is losing by going
on. Undoubtedly there is chaos on the Lakes.
Later I shall approach the question whether
we are trying te overcome that chaos in the
proper way.

There are, it may be said, four divisions
of this measure. One part provides for adoption of agreed charges sections of the British
Road anti Rail Traffic Act. Under this Part
our railways, notwuithstanding provisions of
the Railway Act and of any other Act, may
enter into special agreeoments with patrons
te carry freight at agreed rates. The object
is to give railroads rightrs which their conpetitors cnjoy. Without doubt truck conpanies can and Io make agreed charges. I
pre-sume they ahways will nake thern. Without doubt the railroads' competitors on the
water aIs make agreed rates. The railways
take exception to their disability in this
respect, and their exception is just.
Right Hon. MIr. MEIGHEN.

But I am very doubtful yet-although I
would not oppose the Bill on this ground
alone-whether we have enough evidence to
show, first, that this agreod rates system as
it operates in England is a success. I have
seen considerable evidence, which did not
come before the committee, to convince me
that it is not a success; that it is wholly
unacceptable to the great mass of patrons of
the roads, though acceptable to the roads
themselves.
Secondly, even though we could take it for
granted that the system bas been tolerably
successful in England, I do not think we have
enough evidence to convince us that it would
be applicable in this Dominion, where the
transportation problem is different altogether
froin what it is in the tight little British
Isles.
I know the provisions of this part of the
Bill are opposed by our users of freight from
coast to coast. Can any honourable senator
recall a single user of freigbt or representative of a user of freight who appeared before
the comnitte during its three weeks of sitfings and spoke in favour of agreed charges?
I have received letters containing objections
which I cannot answer, though I listened to
every word of evidence.
The writers of these letters present arguments which in my opinion, with the knowledge I now have, cannot possibly be answered.
They say this part of the Bill would enable
a railway to malke an agreement with a very
large concerni-let us say an electric conpany,

which produces goods of various classes and
weights-an agrenment not for the carrying
of goods on the old basis of Le.l. and carload freight, the two classes into which under
our Act freight is divided, but applicable to
the goods as a whole. A railway could say to
such a firm. "If we get all your business we
will give you certain rates." It is true that,
under the Bill, the Board would be able to
say to the railroad, "If you do that for this
immniense concern ayou nust do it also for the
little fellow." The railroad would agrçe to
fthat. But the small concern's products may
he entirely'v different; they may fall into the
celoap class of freigbt or the dear class. What
is applicable and advantagceous to a big concern nay be wholly disadvantageois to a
small one. In a word, it is contended that
the essential principle of our system of railway supervision by the Railway Board could
no longer be applied if we adopted the agreed
charges provisions.
Tbe essential principle is that in those classes
of freight into whiich our traffic is divided
the small and great shall be treated alike,
all being charged the sane rate, without

MARCH 18, 1937
any discrimination in favour of a shipper who
makes ail or any part of his shipments by one
railroad. The agreed charges provisions,
though they may have to come-because justice .must be done in the end, no matter what
happens-cut athwart the whole principle of
the operation of the Railway Act as it is
to-day. Ail I am contending is this. We
have not got far enough in the study of
these provisions, and particularly in the study
of their effect in Great Britain, where they
have been in force for a space of two or more
years, to make it safe for us to enforce thern
in this Dominion.
I now come to the second division. The
Bill seeks to deal with transport by air and
to regulate air traffic upon principles provided
in the Railway Act for regulating rail traffic.
To this section of the Bill as finally amended
I have no criticism at ail to make. I do not
think there is anything serious to be apprehended in the operation of this part. When
we are in the sphere of aviation traffic we are
happily in our own hunting ground and we
know there is no jurisdiction to dispute us.
This is federal; it is not provincial in any
way, and whatever regulation there is must
be federal. It will be probably meagre regulation for a time. Subsequently it will be
adapted to meet the developments of aviation. That there has to be regulation I do
not doubt, for I know in corresponding fields
regulation has come, and, having once come, it
has never departed. I do not object to the
Bill on the ground of the aviation provisions.
The third class has to do with motor-truck
and bus traffic. As everyone knows, the Bill
pretends to regulate this traffic only in the
sphere of interprovincial and international
trade. It does so because, admittedly, the
Government realizes that the sphere of intraprovincial truck and bus traffic is within the
sole jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures.
It has been stated by the honourable senator
from South Bruce (Hon. Mr. Donnelly) and by
others that the measure of traffic carried by
buses and trucks which comes within the
margin of interprovincial trade is limited to
less than 2 per cent. I do not know what
that percentage would be when you take in
international trade, but I am inclined to thiffk
the evidence showed that the percentages of
international and interprovincial trade together aggregate less than 2 per cent of all
the bus and truck traffic.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
What
does 2 per cent mean? Is there any large
volume of traffic?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Of ail the
bus and truck trade, whatever it may be,
that which belongs to the category of interprovincial and international trade is 2 per cent.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: But is it
a large trade?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is a tremendous trade. The railways estimated that
the amount of money it took from their gross
revenues was $38,000,000. But, at that, there
would be less than 2 per cent of the $38,000,000
attributable to interprovinciail and international traffic. Honourable members, then,
will realize that in respect of truck and bus
traffic the sphere we are seeking to occupy
and regulate federally is a very narrow sphere;
that 98 per cent and more, according to our
admission, comes within' the purview of the
provincial legislatures. And we know, as the
evidence discloses, that the provinces, one and
ail of them, not only occupy the sphere of
that 98 per cent, but, occupying it, they are
regulating it, and they are determined to continue in their occupation and regulation.
The provinces go further. They say: "We
do not admit for a moment your right to come
into even the 2 per cent or any part of it.
We claim that we are in control of that truck
and bus traffic from the moment it starts in
our province until it gets to the boundary,
and when it gets beyond our boundary it is
under control of the jurisdiction within which
it cones." They contend that there is no
fixed structure joining the provinces and
establishing a basis for federal jurisdiction
as exercisedý by the Federal Parliament in
respect of railways. Whether they are right
in the latter contention or noit I do not know.
What I do know is this, that if we pass the
Bill in respect of bus and truck traffic, we
shall only be purchasing a law-suit with the
provinces for the sake of occupying a narrow
territory where we can hardly turn round
after we get in. I ask honourable members,
is it worth while?
The Minister told us he looked forward to
the time when the provinces would surrender
the exercise of the jurisdiction they enjoy,
and by their legisliatures pass it over to the
Railway Board of Canada. Does anyone,
after listening to them before a committee
of the House, think seriously they will? The
tail does not wag the dog in the sphere of
legislation any more than it does anywhere
else. Those who occupy the 98 per cent are
far more likely to invade the 2 per cent than
those who occupy the 2 per cent are to absorb
the 98 per cent.
I was surprised to hear the honourable
leader of the House suggest that those who
opposed the Bill were private interests. I
do not know why private interests should not
oppose if they think the Bill is wrong. But
if ever there was a Bill against which public
interests were arrayed, it was this Bill.
Who represent the public interesta of Canada?

of this main provision that 1 feel I cannot

sectional attitude -of Western senators. Somne
rather harsh words have bcen spoken about
the alleged, sclfishness of the Prairie West as

it is ýperfectly proper to keep this in mmnd,
that the Bill the ohild, as it was described

have to listen with sympathy and give careful
consideration to the protesta of honourable
members fromn the Prairie West against the
measure. They say the ultimate design and
purpose of the measure is to raise rates on
the Great Lakes, and what they fear ehiefly
is the raiaing of rates on their grain. Mcmbers in the Maritime Provinces speak, and
properly sa, about their right to enter the
Central Provinces with their gooda as the
Magna ýCharta of their country, and they
have fought gallantly, persistently and successfully from the birth of this Dominion to this
hour to stand by that right. The West
bas a similar feeling. The very Magna Charta
of the West is the right of shipment on these
lakes under teTmrs of unreatrained cnmpetition. There is no difference of opinion
about that. If anybody expecta ta hear a
breath of sympathy from the Prairie West
with respect to this measure, he is going to
suifer as severe a disappointment as he ever
endured. 1 have had something to do with
Western opinion and know how the West feels,
and sa far as it is the duty of a Western
member to represont Western opinion he is
bound to say the West is against the Bill
almoat to a man. Someone bas said-he may
be right even tbougb the West is against it
-that perhaps their apprehiensions are wrnng;
that the ultirnate resuit of the measure will
not mean an elevation of rates. I thînk the
Government would have done beýtter if it had
frankly said the purpose of the Bill was ta
restore order înstead of chaos, or solvency instead of bankruptcy in the highly competitive
business of shipping on the Great Lakes.
That undoubtedly is the purpose of the Bill.
It bas no other. It can have no other. Nobody is saying the service is not gond enough.
Nobody is complaining that hie cannnt ship
bis grain. It is flot the public that wants
this mneasure. But the lake abippers say:
"We bave been in bankruptcy for years, we
bave tried ta corne ta terms of co-operation,
but cannt do it; sa now we corne to the
doors of Parliarnent"ý-wbere tbey did not
corne befare. "For Heaven's sake belp us.
Corne in and fix rates a tbat we rnay bring
order out of chaos and turn the darkness of
bankruptcy into the sunlight of solvency."
That cannt be done except by an average
raising of rates. Maybe rates will nnt 'be
raised in July of this year or JuIy of next
year; maybe the average increase on the
whole would be very littie, for there is very
little margin 'between succeas and failure in
any business; but the purpose of the Bill
cannot be effected except by the raising of
rates.

system of control, as the industries of England
have done. I certainly prefer the path followed by the British Administration to the
one which the United States Government has
pursued, and which I think lias been attended
and wil.1 be attended with disaster.
There is one other remark I wish to make.
There seems to be a general feeling that we
are coming into an age of regulation; that
we ceannot indefinitely defer regulation. There
are those, and I think they are the keenest
and most intelligent observers. who feel that
more and more liberty must be given to business and to industry in the way of selfregulation.
Hon. Mr. GORDON:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And others
say that we must have the old-fashioned competition, just as it raged in the days wien individuals competed with their neighbours,
when business units were small. But competition as it existed in those days does not
prevail to-day, and it cannot. We all know
that. If it were to prevail it would mean
mutual destruction, hardship all arcund and
sacrifice of public interest. We pass some laws
to-day that seem to be based on the theory
that industries should not communicile with
one another, and that if they do, if they have
so much as a telepione communication and
agree upon certain things tbat are supposed
to be ethical among them. their managers must
go to jail. Greater humbug and hypocrisy were
never heard of.
It is impossible to import the old unrestrained competition into the economy of this
time. Does anyone believe that among the
vast industries of Canada conpetition prevails to-day on the old ruthless scale-that
companies have no arrangements with one
another? We all know that is net the situation. That kind of competition did prevail
in the paper industrv, and in consequence we
were virtually stripped frocs coast tO coast
of our greatest resource, which was being sold
out at bankruptcy prices. To-day the Government of Ontario and the Government of
Quebec are necouraging co-operation and understanding

over their co-operative actions, and this only
for the purpose of seeing that the people, who

might be exercised by cold-blooded monopolies.
I should net like for one minute-and I
do net believe the Government really wantsto have this measure in operation so far as
transport by water is concerned.
J venture
to say that if it is passed here the Government will never carry it through the other
House. I cannot see how the Administration
could ask its followers from the Prairies in
that House to vote for the Bill as it now stands.
With respect to its main feature the Government should proceed along a different line.
It should wait another year before submitting
a measure to regulate transportation. I do
not think it can be doubted that at a later
session the Government, with the advantage
of study that it can make in the meantime,
will be able to present a far more acceptable
measure.

Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, bear.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senators. we have heard' considerable very
interesting discussion on the Bill which has
been submitted to us, and which held our
attention in the Railway Committee for
more than three weeks. The Minister of
Transport declared in the committee that he
thought this was a necessary piece of legislation. He admitted that it would be difficult to work out, and that its success would
very largely depend! upon its administration.
He repeated! more than once that the primary
purpose of the Bill was not the protection of
the raihays; and ho said that the intention of
the Government. or of himself, at all events,
was not to regulate one industry at the expense of another. He added:
The intention is that regulation shall be
applied to each industry in the interest of that
particular indusstry, and having in iaind, of
course, the proction of the public that uses
the industry. But it is not a Bill to protect
one industry against a conpeting industry.

MAORCH 18, 1937
Then, in the course of his remarks he said:
The intention is to set up rates that are
fair to all.
What is the situation in Canada to-day?
First, we have more lines of railway than the
traffic requires; second, we have more steamships than are needed in our inland waterways; third, we already have more aeroplanes
than are required by the traffic.
As to shipping, the Minister gave us the
picture as he saw it. Speaking of shipping,
I may quote a statement made before the
Canad'ian Club of Ottawa, copies of which
were d'istributed to the members of the committee. The Minister said:
Now, in speaking of shipping I refer only to
shipping, we will say, from Quebec to the head
of the Great Lakes, because shipping on the
coast is not competitive-not very seriously
competitive-with rail movement; or, if it is
competitive, it is not the destructive form of
competition. Of course, if we move goods from
Halifax to a point on the St. Lawrence river
we take that business away from the railroads
in a sense, yet it

is business that always did

move by boat and is moving to about the same
extent that it always bas moved; but the
destructive competition is found chiefly on the
Great Lakes and on the St. Lawrence. There
we have a condition that I believe is not sound.
In 1926, 1927 and 1928 people interested in
shipping in this country found that they could
go to England, buy a boat under the British
Aid ta Industries Act from a shipbuilder and
make a down payment, which I think was about
ten per cent, and that they would be in the
boat business. A great number of boats were
bought at that time. I suppose our fleet of
river boats, that is, the St. Lawrence canalsized boats, was doubled in two or three years.
Then in 1931 or 1932 we completed the Welland
canal, which permitted the largest grain carriers,
the largest bulk carriers, which had always
been confined to the upper lakes, to go through
as far as Kingston or Prescott. By so doing
we halved the number of boats required to
handle grain down the St. Lawrence and
through the Lachine and other St. Lawrence
canals. By a process of easy buying we doubled
our fleet of this type of boat, and by opening
the Welland canal we doubled it again, sa
that in 1933 and 1934 we had about four times
as many of this olass of boat as we had any
real need for. Well, these boate of course
could not be kept idle and they went into the
Great Lakes and into territory that they had
never attempted to serve before and engaged
in all sorts of traffic in competition with the
railways-package freight such as canned goods,
or sugar, or cement. Commodities of that sort
were their first objective, and later on all sorts
of package goods and commodities which had
been exclusively the railways' were moved by
these carriers.
"Well," you may say, "that is legitimate
competition; the railway cannot object to that."
But I think that is hardly the case. On a
great many of these boats that were built
with a down payment of ten per cent there was
never another payment. The builder of the
boat is in England, and the bank that holds
the collateral is in England, and the boat is
here. There is not much object in foreclosure,

219

and there have been no foreclosures. I think
that of the boats built in 1926, 1927 or 1928

legitimate interest in the lakes, such as Canada
Steamships and other lines which have a background of operating experience, were forced
into bankruptcy. Canada Steamships, as you
know, was operated by its bondholders for a
time and bas juet gone through a reorganization.
So the competition of bankrupt tonnage with
our railways is very serious indeed.
You may say that that tonnage is good, even
if bankrupt, and we might as well leave it
there, because the people get the benefit. But
those things hardly work out. As you know,
a buyers' market is usually followed by a
sellers' market. I am not a believer in the
law of scarcity. I do not believe we should
artificially make things scarce, or artificially
make transportation scarce, but I think we
could correct a situation which is rapidly
developing, in that we might have combinations
of these boats worked out for the salvation of
whoever has an interest in them, and in that
way we get a monopoly and an artificial control
of our shipping-an artificial buyers' market
created through a monopoly.
The intention of the Bill, as the Minister said
in his statement, is to establish rates that
will be fair to all. As I have already said,
we have too many railways, too many steamships and too many aeroplanes. The object
of this Bill is to eliminate wasteful competition. That is the long view of the situation. And I would draw the attention of
my colleagues to the statement that no existing carrier will be eliminated. All who are
engaged in the trade to-day will obtain their
licences.
This type of legislation is not new. We
are nat breaking new ground. In Great
Britain the Co-ordination Act was passed some
years ago, whereby the territory was divided,
some traffic being allocated to the railways
and some to the highways. It may be said
that this d(oes not interest us very much,
because our traffic is mostly provincial, and
the competition, so far as we can have any
control, is not between, highways and railways. That I admit. Nevertheless, Great
Britain has laid down the principle that companies serving the public and having a
formidable amount of capital invested in them
should be protectedJ against disastrous and
uncalled' for competition. In South Africa
no competition whatever is permitted if a
community is adequately served by the railways. Trucks are allowed to operate in communities not served by railways. In Australia a certificate of public convenience and
necessity is required before competition with
the railway is allowed. The situation in, the
United States is much the same as it is in
Canada. There they have state rights; here
we have provincial rights. In the United

boundaries, much as this Bill proposes shall be

In Canada, because of our constitutional
limitations, our only practicable approach to
setting our house in ordier is regulation
rat.her than co-ordination. It is said', and it
has been repeated more than once in this
Chamber, that the present legislation will not
go very far. That I readily admit. But, as
everyone realizes and admits, it is a beginning,
a step in the right direction.
Our Western representatives fear the effect
of this legislation on the price of wheat.
They say the regulation of shipping will tend
to increase rates on the Great Lakes. My
answer is, not necessarily.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: May I interrupt the
honourabe gentleman? I think it is absolutely proved by the evidence given before
the committee. I am not a member of the
committee, but I am of the opinion that if
there is any regulation of rates on the Great
Lakes and competition is destroyed, the rates
for the transportation of grain will be raised.
I do not think there can be any doubt about
that.

to the contrary?

at Fort William, and has lived there for
twenty-five years.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Will the honourable gentleman take the word of the great
Liberal newspaper of the country, which says
rates will be raised, if the Bill is passed'?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think I have
more esteem and admiration for Mr. John
Dafoe than my honourable friend has.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The list of
subscribers of the Winnipeg Free Press must
have increased within this last week.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
members from the West have expressed the
fear that regulation on the Great Lakes would
tend to an increase in rates and I have
answered that that would net necessarily be
so. I would draw attention te the fact that
no minimum rate would be fixed by the
Transport Board. Shippers would be absolutely free to reduce rates at their own will,
but, having once filed a rate, they could not
raise it for thirty days thereafter. Shippers
could reduce a rate by filing a new oneHon. Mr. CORDON: Not without the
authority of the Board.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Yes, they could
do that without consent of the Board, but
once a rate is filed it could not be increased
for thirty days thereafter. Any shipper could
file a rate as low as he wished, but, once
filed, it would become public and would have
to remain in effect for at least thirty days.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I am quite sure my
honourable friend is wrong there. The rate
would go into effect three days after being
authorized by the Board.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No. A shipper
would have three days within which to notify
the Board of the rate that he fixes.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: May I interrupt
to tell the honourable gentleman that the
Winnipeg Grain Exchange knows more about
rates for wheatHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Will my honourable friend allow me to finish? I am supposed to be the last to speak on this motion.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
not seem to be.

But you do

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
A shipper, I
repeat, would be able to reduce a rate at
will, but once having fixed it he could not
raise it until the expiration of at least thirty
days thereafter. That is the only regulation
on grain rates. It was alleged in the committee that at times it would be necessary
to have two rates for the same kind of grain
on one boat. For example, it was said that
a boat capable of carrying 600,000 bushels
might have 500,000 on board, and in order to
get a full cargo the ship owner might quote

a lower rate for the last 100,000 bushels. Al

I can say is that if any chiseling is donc by
the trader on the rate for a part of the cargo
in cases like that, the advantage goes not te
the farmer, but te the trader. I ask my honourable friends if that is not se. The Minister said this was just a form of chiseling
on the part of the trader and that it had nothing at all to do with the farmer.

MARCH 18, 1937
The Minister also stated, as honourable
members may see by referring to page 303
of the committee's proceedings, "I am of opinion there is nothing in this Bill that will increase the cost of moving grain from the head
of the lakes to Montreal." I think I can say
on behalf of all members of Parliament, in
this House and the other, that none of us
would think of doing anything to reduce
the price of wheat to the farmer. All the
efforts of Parliament have been in the opposite direction. A committee of this House
was appointed in 1925 to examine into the
railway situation, and we know that the rates
our railways charge for carrying wheat between Fort William and the West are 25 per
cent lower than those charged by American
railways for running over parallel territory
in the United States.
All who are familiar with the trade know
that when a farmer sells wheat on the Winnipeg Grain Exchange he pays the trader the
freight from Fort William to Liverpool. Suppose the price is $1.30 per bushel when the
farmer orders his agent to sell. The agent
charges against that $1.30 the cost of transportation and deducts any advances that have
been made on the grain. Against the price
that the farmer receives the freight charges
from Fort William to Liverpool, or other
European port, as the case may be, have
been calculated. Traders who bid for grain
at the market price have to reckon the freight
costs which they must absorb. These traders
-they are not numerous; I understand there
are only about twelve or fifteen of themhave the reputation of being sharp business
men, and I take it they play safely. In order
to do that, what must they do? As my
honourable friend from Kootenay East (Hon.
Mr. King) said this afternoon, they calculate
the maximum freight rate.

221

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: He sells it f.o.b.
Liverpool. He makes the purchase at Winnipeg, but the grain itself is at Fort William,
and out of his own pocket he has to pay
freight charges from Fort William to Liverpool. So in determining what price he can
offer the Western farmer he must reckon his
freight charges and his profit.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:

to play safely. Naturally he will not reckon
on a rate that would cause him to lose money.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Or to lose businees.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No one can
gainsay that the trader, when he buys, plays
safely. His object is not to lose money.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Will the honourable
gentleman permit me? I am sorry to interrupt. The grain business is a fluctuating
business with every day a spread of, say,
one-eighth of a cent to a cent or a cent and
a haIf. Men who are in the export business
know exactly, month by month, what the
average freight cost to them is. They are
interested in getting business, and competition is very keen. Now, unless we have absolute evidence that in fixing their prices they
take into consideration only the maximum
freight rates, I should doubt that they do so.
I quite agree that they play safely.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The freight rate
fluctuates, I agree. The person who bas first
knowledge about that is the trader who is
affected by the fluctuation up or down. He
considers the situation and arranges to proteet himself.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Quite so. He plays
safely.

tain honourable gentlemen, know more about
w'hat takes place tihere than I do. Those
traders reckon upon what they will psy for

of one per cent less for the freight rate,"
while another may say that ho will charge
haîf of une per cent more. But a fair average
is reached. Besidas, the Livearpool price 15
quoted on the Winnipeg Grain Exchange,
aud the farmer cares very hittle as to wbat

As my honourable friend bas just said, it la a

that tends tu ehiminate cumpetition or to in-

MARCH 18, 1937
crease rates on the lakes. On the contrary,
any shipper can fix his minimum rate. The
only difficulty-andi it may be a grievance,
though I wonder why-is that when the
shipper has reduced the rate andi eut into
the iegitimate-profit of his competitor, then
he must keep that rate down thirty days. I
suppose if anyone benefited it would, be the
farmer.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: But surely my honourable friend misunderstands that phase.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
not.

Oh, no, I do

Hon. Mr. GORDON: If the freight rate
were reduced the shipper would have to wait
only three days bef.ore it went into operation.
But that is not the point at all. The shipper
goes to the railway company, and! the railway
company may take a go.od time to say whether
it will give him that reduced, rate. Then the
matter has to go before the Railway Commission.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No. Hon. Mr.
Guthrie, Chairman of the Railway Board, said
just the contrary; that the railways could
reduee their rates. The only control the
Railway Board has is by reason of the requirement that the railways cannot increase any
rate without first obtaining approval of the
Board.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I venture to say the
honourable gentleman misunderstood Mr.
Guthrie altogether.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Order, order.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As I have said,
the interest of the farmer is ended when he
collects the price of his grain. Then begins
the operation of the trader, who becomes
very keen for any profit there may be in
securing a reduced rate; but it is his profit,
not that of the farmer. Now, I invite any
honourable member to question the correctness of what I am about to say. The Railway
Board in its regulation of rates has always been
fair to al,-to railways, shippers, and the
public. The Board has administered the Railway Act honestly and efficiently. I wonder
what justifies any honourable member in thinking that the Transport Board would not do
likewise with respect to shipping rates.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) before recess touched upon a new feature of the
Bill-agreed rates. Such rates are in operation in England. Our railway situation is
disastrous. I recognize there are vested in-

22

terests to protect. I am somewhat ashamed
to say that we ail represent those vested interests. As taxpayers, we have individually
to carry our share of the millions invested in
the Canadian National Railways and pay
our portion of the annual deficits. This Bill
grants the railways what perhaps is their principal benefit, the right already exercised by
the carrier by road or by water. Let me cite
a short statement descriptive of what the
carriers by water do. In his address before the
Canadian Club of this city the Minister of
Transport said:
There is one new feature of the Act, which
bas worked very well in England, but which
bas not been tried on this continent, and if
we apply it here it will have to be applied
with care, and that is the provision for agreed
rates. A shipper and the railway may agree
on a contract for a movement of goods over a
period exclusively by one carrier, or may make
any other contract they like, at a rate below
the tariff rate. Of course that is giving the
railways only the leeway that every other form
of transportation bas to-day. In any other form
of transportation contracts can be made, and
are made, for the exclusive movement of goods
at any rate agreed upon. But the provision
here is that the contract must be filed with the
Board of Railway Commissioners, must be
examined by them, is subject to the hearing of
anyone who cares to protest, and must of course
be non-discriminatory. I think that that is
introducing into railway rate-making a feature
that deserves a place and must have a place
under present conditions, and I have every
confidence that that will work out well.
And he adds:
Let me illustrate what happens in the present
situation. Certain canned goods move from
points on the Great Lakes-a movement that
the railways had always had. Last year the
steamboat people decided they were going to
have that business, and not merely part of it,
but all: se they went in and made a contract
with the canning companies to move their
canned goods at the head of the lakes at eight
cents below the rail tariff. Of course the railway people were a little disturbed by that.
They made very sure that that contract was
binding, and then they went in and eut the
rate on canned goods by rail from the canneries
at the head of the lakes down to somewhere
near the eight cents and made the boat people
move the goods for next to nothing. That is
just a sample of the kind of competition we
are getting under the present situation, and I
think that by making rules that will apply to
ail, giving them some flexibilityThis is an expression I heard this evening.
-and
placing certain restrictions on ratemaking on ail sides, we shall be able to do
something in the way of straightening the
situation.
We have heard in this Chamber and in
many other places in Canada that the railway situation is a serious one and that the
Government and Parliament are doing nothing about it. The Minister of Transport has

224

SENATE

had the courage to grapple with that situation, which already had corne before Parliament two or tbree years ago. My right honourable friend to my right (Riglit lion. Mr.
Graham) knows something about that. The
Minister of Transport bas offered this measure
to Parliament, and bas suggcsted that the
proper place to examine and review the
measure, and to modify and improve it, is
the Senate of Canada. I hope we were flot
unequal to the task. From the statements I
heard this afternoon it would seem that we
have rnodified and improved the Bill.
My right honourable friend (Rîght Hon.
Mr. Meighen) said the other day, and perhaps again this aftcrnoon, that the measure
had very few friends. Then he addcd-if flot
this afternoon, two or three days ago, when
the report came before the Huse: "Oh, yes,
everyonc is in favour of regulation exccpt
for himself." It was then that 1 said that
sucli was the state of mind of those representing private interests, and suggested that
the Senate of Canada should have a 'wider
horizon. 1 ar n ot sure, but tbe impression
lingers in my mind that in the debate on the
Address the Right Hon. Mr. Bennett congratulated the Minister upon bis courage in
announcing this legisiation.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will the Senate
of Canada. whicb stands above the passing
prejudices and fears of the people, lie more
tirnid than that right honourable gentleman
about giving this legisiation a chance to lie
tried? I think it was rny honourable frîend
from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder) who said
that the Government would lie well advised to
postpone the Bill for a year in order that
tbe situation miglit lie exarnined into for the
purpose of secing if there was not sorne other
means of attaining the same end. With ail
due respect to the honourable gentleman, I
really believe it would be inadvisable to
follow bis suggestion, because if the Bill passes
-I do not know whether it will pass the
Commons or not-two or tliree years would
lie required in order to give it a fair test.
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It would flot
corne into operation anyway unless it wau
proclaimed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It lias been said
that to introduce sucli legislation as this is
to run a formidable risk politically. Well, I
am somewh*at proud of the man who stands
up and takes the risk if lie believes it is in
the interest of Canada to do so. I have more
Hoa. Mr. DANDURAND.

than onc'e said to public men wbo faced a
situation the solution of which seemed to be
contrary to the popular will, that one should
take the risk, for in losing bis soul lie is
saving it.
Some lion. SENATORS:

Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I refer to bis
political soul. So, in view of the efforts made
by the Minister of Transport, I suggest that
the Senate should do something to cope with
the present situation. We are ail thorouglily
familiar with the danger the railway situation
presents. We are aware of the millions that
bave 'been put into our railways. We know
tliat we bave had to meet a deficit of
$47,0O,000 or $50,00,000 a year. It is suggested that this is a balf-bearted attempt to
meet the situation and may not produce very
mucli in the way of results; but I believe that
if the principle of regulation is a good one we
should ýask the Commons to pass upon it.
I recognize the riglit of the Senate to express its opinion even upon a Goverument bill
rnitiated here. I believe that party feelings
and party advantage sbould and do play a
very small part in this Chamber. It bas been
my effort to examine each bill or proposaI
that bas corne before us upon its menit. I
believe there is menit in this Bill. I du not
know how it will. work, but I have confidence
in the Railway Board, wbich is our guarantee for the future, and in view of the situation ahead I move tbe third reading of the
Bill.
Hon. Mn. McMEANS: Would thie honourable gentleman permit a question? I ask iA
witli the greûtest deference, and not for the
purpose of getting bim to express an opinion.
Will he assert on bis responsibuhity as a
senator of Canada that if clause 4 of Vhis
Bill passes there will be no increase in freiglit
rates from Fort William?
Hon. Mr. DA'N]URAND: My answer bas
been in express terms that no ship that is in
the trade to-day will be refused a licence; so
we rnay lie -assured that we shaîl have as
many slips as we had yesterday. As to the
future, I ar n ot a prophet, but I say that
the present Govýernrnent, and the next, will be
very careful of the interests of Canada and
of the Western Provinces.

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 42, an Act to amend the
Old Age Pensions Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the object
of this Bill is to amend the Old Age Pensions
Act to provide for the payment of pensions to
blind persons who fulfil the conditions laid
down in the measure.
I feel sure that every member of this House
approves the granting of pensions to blind
persons at an age earlier than 70 years, and
that it is not necessary for me to speak at
length in support of the motion. The position of those who suffer from physical handicaps of any kind has always made a strong
appeal to public sympathy. This is especially
so in the case of persons who are blind, because blindness, in addition to being a personal tragedy, is differentiated from other
physical defects by its very serious economie
consequences.
Blind persons are no doubt
able to produce work of a high quality in
certain occupations, but on the whole it is
difficult for them to attain the speed or
efficiency which is possible for sighted persons, and their capacity for self-support is in
most cases greatly diminished. I am not,
however, attempting to stimulate interest in
or arouse sympathy for the blind, because I
assume that such sympathy and interest
already exist in this House and in the country and that all that is necessary for me to
do is to outline the Government's proposals
to alleviate the lot of the blind who are in
distress.
The Bill provides for the payment of pensions to the blind by means of amendment
to the Old Age Pensions Act. The effect of
this is that the provincial pension authorities
and the machinery now set up for the administration of old age pensions will be utilized
for the payment of pensions to the blind.
Before pensions can be paid to the blind in
any province it will be necessary for that
province to enter into a new agreement with
the Dominion for the payment of pensions to
the aged and the blind in accordance with the
Old Age Pensions Act as amended by the new
Bill. If the Government of a province has
not authority to enter into such an agreement with the Dominion for the payment of
pensions to the blind, it will be necessary for
the province to pass appropriate legislation.
The applications for pensions will thus be
made to the provincial pension authorities,
who will grant or reject them in accordance
with the provisions of our Act and regulations

and wbo will psy the amount of the pensions
granted. The Dominion, as in tbe case of oid
age pensions, will psy to the province threequarters of the amount paid by tbe province
in respect of such pensions.
There are many definitions of blindness, and
Even in
some of them vary considerably.
the samne countries the definitions are different,
depending upon whether they have reference
to census enumeration, education, pensions,
and so on. After careful conisideration of
many definitions it bias been decided that the
Eýnglish definition is the most satisfactory for
a Bihl providing for the payment of pensions
to the blind. By the Blind Persons Act, 1920,
of the United Kingdom, a blind persan means
a persan who is sa blind as to be unable to
perform aay work for which eyesight is
essential. It is recognized tbat tbis is a general definition and that it is stili necessary
to express what it means in terms wbich

England the Minister of Healtb bas set out

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In the Bill as it
now stands a married blind person may
receive a pension of $240 a year and may
have in addition a permissible income of $400,
as compared with a permissible income of $200
allowed to a single blind pensioner.
The
double allowance was intended to take into
account the married pensioner's obligation to
contribute to the support of a family. However, under the present provisions of the Bill,
two blind persons if married to each other
would be allowed a total income of $1,280;
each would receive a pension of $240 and
each might have a permissible income of $400.
This is felt to be too generous, and the
amendment provides that in the case of a
person married to another blind person, each
receiving a pension under the Act, the maximum permissible income in each case should
be $200.

Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: The amendment

explain the situation.
8A. (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of
subsection one of section nine of this Act the
maximum pension payable te a blind person
shall be two hundred and forty dollars yearly:
Provided that in the case of a blind person,
who, after the coming into force of this section,
marries a person so blind as to be unable to
perform any work for which eyesight is essential, the maximum pension payable shall be
one hundred and twenty dollars yearly.
(3) The pensions payable under the provisions of the last preceding subsection shall
be subject to reduction as follows:
(a) in the case of an unmarried person or a
widower without a child or children or a widow
without a child or children, by the amount of
the income of the pensioner in excess of two
hundred dollars a year;
(b) in the case of a married person or a
widower with a child or children or a widow
with a child or children, by the amount of the
income of the pensioner in excess of four hundred dollars a year.
Now comes the proposed amendment:
(c) In the case of a person married te a

CANADA-UNITED STATES INCOME TAX
CONVENTION
RESOLUTION

OF APPROVAL

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
members, a message has been received from
the House of Commons in the following
words:

228

SENATE

Resolved that a message be sent to the
Senate to inform Their Honours that this
House has adopted a resolition approving of
a convention niade between Canada and the
United States of Anerica concerning the rates
of incone tax, signed at Washington, December
30, 1936; and requesting that Their Honours
unite with this House in the approval of the
said resolution.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators. this matter of the regulation of the
income tax to be collected from residents of
Canada who have stocks or interests in the
United States, and from residents of the
United States who have stocks in Canada, is
familiar to us all, as it has been pending for
a number of years.

I might read the whole convention, or
might spend half an hour in explaining its
workings, but I sahil content my>self with saying that under it Canada stands to gain by
reason of the fact that her nationals will
no longer be obliged to pay ten per cent
to the American Government while Americans pay only five per cent on their holdings
in this country.
With this summlary statement I move the
adopiion of this convention.

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I am very glad the convention has been entered into. For a considerable time Canadian investors in American
securities have been subject to a levy of

0f course this tax, which will be five per
cent as long as the agreement is in effect,
is not of the same character at ail as other
taxes which the United States Government
have imposed, and of which there is no counterpart on this side. It i.s a most preposterous
thing that the Canadian holder of a security
in a Canadian company should he taxed in
the United States simply because the security
was bought, say, on the New York exehange
and was afterwards sold there at a profit.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 thought they
had suspended their actionRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Tliey did suspend it, and started again. Whether or flot
it is suspended at this minute I do not know.
Letters stili keep coming in. I can think of
nothing that is more calculated to destroy
the friendship between the two countries than
a tax of that kind.
The tax under consideration is a tax of a
different stamp, and even though the Government could get nothing of a permanent nature
I arn glad it got as much as it could, and I
congratulate the Canadian Minister.
lIon. Mr. DANDURAND: As the arrangement comes into effect as of the lst of January, 1936, I surmise that those who are called
upon to pay under the new convention will
be able to arrange with the United States
Government for the deduction of whatever
lias been paid over and above the five per
cent, and that there will lie an equalization.
As to the abandonment or denunciation
of the present convention, what my riglit
lionourable friend lias said is very true. If
the convention con tained a proviso stating
that it was to remain in effect for three years
we should feel that there was a certain sedurity.
However, I amn convinced that under the present administration the convention will continue until the end of the term of the President of the United States, who is practising
the "good neiglibour" policy.
I move the adoption of the resolution.
Hon, C. MacARTHUR: I sliould like to
ask the riglit honourable leader on the other
side of the Bouse (Riglit Hon. Mr. Meiglien)
whetlier lie thinks the collection of taxes
from Canadian investors who have bouglit
or sold on the New York exchange is prac,ticable. The Canadian investor does flot
make any return to the American Government. I have heard it said that there is very
littie in the contention put forward liy the
riglit lionourable gentleman. Does lie think
the brokers in New York are going to show
aIl the transactions with Canadians?

Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Very sulistantial surns have been paid under suggestions-I had almost said threats-of various
kinds. The American Government, in respect
of those claims, is in this position: it cau
impound the securities whicli a Canadian holds
in an Amnerican company, and further, can
refuse the riglit of sale on American exclianges.
These powers have liad the effect of inducing
quite a number of Canadians, companies as
well as individuals, to adopt the view that
perliaps they liad better pay and get clear as
best they could.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Many do not
pay.
The motion was agreed to.

system, signed at Washington on the 26th May,
1930, it is expedient that the Houses of Parliament do approve of a declaration being
made on the part of Canada to the effect that
the provisions of the convention maay be administered upon the following understandings:
(1) That the International Pacific Salmon
Fisheries Commission shall have no power to
authorize any type of fishing gear contrary to
the laws of the State of Washington or the
Dominion of Canada;
(2) That the commission shall not pronsulgate or enforce regulations until the scientific
investigations provided for in the convention
have been made, covering two cycles of sockeye salmon runs, or eighît years; and
(3) That the commission shall set up an
advisory comminttee coiposed of five persans
froin eaci country who shall be representatives
of the various branches of the industry (purse
seine, gill net, troll, sport fishing, ami one
other), which advisory committee shall be
invited to all non-executive meetings of the
commission and shall be given full opportunity to examine and to he heard on all
proposed orders, regulations or recommendations;
and that this House do approve of the same;
provided that nothing in this resolution contained shall be deemed to prevent the Governor
in Council from exercising at any timne any
authority in him vested to iake effective orders
or regulations duly adopted by the said commission.
Honourable senators will notice that these
understandings, which werc added to the convention when it was adopted by the Senate
of the United States, give the impression that
the regulations cannot come into force until
eight years from the time when the convention was adopted or ratified. That may be so.
Yet it is hoped that if the commission is at
last set up it may be able, before the eight
years have expired, to arrive at some resolutions or conclusions by which the Governments
of the United States and of Canada will abide.
I know that to quite a number of Canadians
it appears to be an unsatisfactory state of
affairs that after waiting seven years we should
have to wait eight years more. However, the
Government believes that this is a step forward and one which will have to be taken, and
that since we have waited seven years for
ratification of the convention by the United
States we may feel it is opportune and wise
to adopt the understandings which I have just
read. As I have said, it is hoped that eight
y-ars may not pass before some decisions are
arrived at or some regulations proposed which
will make the convention effective.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: I understand the Government is desirous, for adequate
reasons. that the resolution be adopted tonight. Otherwise I should have liked to sec

senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.

he has given a great deal of attention and time
to the whole subject of sockeye salmon production and control, and this session has had on
the Order Paper a series of questions, to which
I believe answers were recently given.

that were going on had the effect of reducing
the supply to a small fraction of its former
abundance. Negotiations which had lasted for
years were concluded in the early part of 1930,
when representatives of the two countries arrived at terms embodied in the present convention. This convention, of course, had to receive assent by the United States, and though
possibly assent by the Parliament of Canada
was not legally necessary there was, according
to our practice, a submission to us as well.
Opinion was expressed at that -time that bfore Parliament gave its approval it would
be better to wait for assent by the American
Senate. That course was not taken because,

Senate failed to approve, and year after year
lias passed without any control at ail being
exercised over the fisheries. Evils of the former
state of affairs simply continused. until recently
the American Senate at last adopted the convention, subject to the three understandings, as
thcy ae de-cribed. Thiey ar really reservations.
In mi judgment these reservations virtually
cancel the treaty. What dlo they provide?
They provide, first of all, that no regulations
shall be agreedi upon by the two countries'
rcprcsentatives under the terns of the convention until a sufficient tiine has passed to
enable two ruas of sockeve salmon to come
and go. As we all are aware, two runs require eighît years.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

That is so.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And am I
correct in saying that the treaty las only
fifteen years to run from the date of ratification?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Riglst Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: So there
would be only seven years left after the first
regulations could be promnulgated. Well, that
is pretty serious. There will be another eight
years without any control at all, and then
there will remain a period of only seven years
in which the treaty can havc effect.

MARCH 30, 1937
But that is not the worst reservation.
Another one is that when regulations do come
to. be made, any having to do with the type
of fisbing net to be used cannot become effective if they conflict with the law of either the
State of Washington or ýof the appropriate
jurisdiction in Canada. What does that
mean? If I understand English, here is what
it means. Suppose that after eight ycars have
passed the commissioners decide that a certain
size of net is required so that young sockeye
salmon may escape and propagate and this
industry may be preserved. Then if it is
found that that type of net is not in conformity with the law of the State of Washington, that state's law must prevail. What
kind of treaty is that? It just means that
after eight years have elapsed, after a study
has heen completed and the commissioners are
in a position to promulgate regulations, any
regulations in respect of this very vital
matter of providing for escapement of sockeye
salmon from nets will in reality be subject
to approval by the State of Washington.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: And the Dominion of
Canada.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: The regulations have
to be in conformity with the laws of Canada
as well as of the State of Washington.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, but that
does not, help a bit. It is really just the
saine as if only the State of Washington were
mentioned, because regulations will have to
comply with the law of that state.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Quite right.
Right Hýon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The third
provision is one which I cannot regard s0
seriously, although I knýow that in some
quarters it is seriously regardcd. Nothing

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do flot

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: To one who is
flot familiar with conditions on the Pacifie
coast ýthere is a fact which appears very
extraordinary. Under the convention a great
ûsset, a natural resource, is to be shared in
equally by the United States and CanadaRight Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Although the
source of the salmon is Canadian.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -although the
source of the salmon is the Fraser river. But
when the salmon go to sea, not only do they
fali prey to United States fishermen, but they
may also fail prey to fishermen from Japan.
I cannot understand why the United States
of America and the Dominion of Canada
should not do their level best to maintain and
preserve for both countries that great assetHon. Mr. LYNCH-STAIJNTON: But they
do not.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

under the convention, they arc joint beneficiaries. Whilc 1 recognize the force of my
right honourable friend's statement, I would
point out that perhaps after a commission bas
surveyed the ground it may be able so to
stir up public opinion in both countries as
to bring about better conditions. I move the
adoption of the resolution.
Honourable
Hon. G. H. BARNARD:
senators, in view of the remarks of the right
bonourable leader on this skie of the House
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), I do not propose,
as I had intended, to suggest adjournment
of the debate to give the honourable sena(Hon. Mr.
tor from New Westminster
Taylor) an opportunity of discussing the
matter. We have been given to understand
that for some reason the Government is
anxious that the treaty should be ratified
at once.
It is a littie difficuit to see tbe need for such
hurry. The original treaty was .ratified by
this Parliament some seven or eight years
ago, and it was only after some years of discussion that the United States Government
ýdecided to make any overtures at ail in connection with the matter.
In my judgment the people of British
Columbia are not likely to receive this treaty

SENATE
with any loud acclaim. The whole trouble
bas been with the State of Washington.
Apparently those in control of the fishing industry in that state have been so eager to
make money quickly that they have altogether lost sight of the advantage of conserving the fishery out of which they are making
Many persons with expert

knowledge of the sockeye salmon have come
to the conciusion that it would be better
for the people of British Columbia to exhaust
the fishery and get what they can out of it.
They have absolutely no confidence that the
people of the State of Washington will "play
bal'"-tint they will try to conserve the
industry.
However, this Government bas takon the responsibility of asking for raýtification of the
treaty, in the hope that something beneficial
may result. What that benefit may be it is
hard to say. There is a request for an eightyear investigation. Whv, experts have been
investigating the sockeye salmon fishery for the
last thirty years. I doubt very iuc whetier
the proposed commission will be able to add
to our present knowledge after eigbt more
years of inve-tigition. But our Government
says the ratification of this treatvy will icad to
the setting up of a coinmis-ion which may do
soeitthing to conserve the fishery. Welh the
responsibilitv is on the Governiment. and I se
no reason whv it should be relieved of that
responsibility.
For these reasons I shall not oppose the
resolution. At the saine time I would remind
honourable members that we in British Columfroi the

Government would be so advised.
In 1930 the Americans had by far the larger
part of the catch: I think they had rougily
about two-thirds as against Canada's onethird. But last year, I understand, the positions were reversed. So if the object of the
convention is to bring about approximate
equaibty of catch by limiting the fishing in
different parts, and so on, it would semcthat
the Americans would have good reason before
long to make somle move in that regard.

It is disappointing, especially to our Government, that these understandings or modificaHon.

tions or reservations--whatever they mnay be
termed-in administration of the treaty should
seem to bold up the matter for another seven
or eight years. But, to me, i-t is unthinkable
that we should, as suggested by the honourable member from Victoria (Hon. Mr.
Barnard), consider destruction of the spawning
beds of the sockeye salmon. and consequent
destruction of the whole fishing industry. No
doubt certain conditions in the Statbe of Woashington are creating considerable trouble, but
I understand that a large majority of the
fishermen on the Pacifie coast are in favour of
the proposed arrangement, and it seems to be
the only forward step that we can make at
the present moment.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Does the honourable
member mean the fishermen on the Canadian
or on the American side?
Hon. Mr. HORSEY: The fishermen on the
Canadian side. Therefore I think it would be
unwise for us to rejeet the treaty.
lon. Mr. BARNARD: I may point out to
the lionourable gentleman who bas just taken
bis seat (Hon. Mr. Horsey) that the depletien of the sockeye salmon fishery was
brought about by the fishermen of the State
of Wa-hington, their indiscriminate use of fish
traps resulting in a frightful ivaste of immature
fisl.
They have for the tiie being abandoned the se of fish traps. but tiere is nothing in this treaty to prevent their resorting
to that method again to-morrow.

Hon. Mr. BARNARD: The honourable

Hon. Mr. HORSEY:

Perhaps net.

Hon. Mr. BARNARD: There is no relation between the fish traps used on the lower
end of Vancouver Island and the fish traps
which the Americans operated off the mouth
of the river. I do not wish to be rude to
thie honourible gentleman, but I must say
he betrays his ignorance of the local situation.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It is moved by
Hon. Mr. Dandurand, seconded by Right Hon.
Mr. Graham, that it be resolved that, in connection with the exchange of ratifications of
the convention between Canada and the

UNITED KINGDOM TRADE

AGREEMENT BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill 79, an Act respecting
a certain Trade Agreement between Canada
and the United Kingdom.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND

moved the

second reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable members, I would
ask leave of the Senate to move the second
reading of this Bill now.
It contains the
trade agreement modifying and extending the
Ottawa convention of 1932. The agreement
has not been amended in the other Chamber,
and I am under the impression that no honourable senator would now desire to make any
change.
May I give this concise explanation of
the agreement? It is to come into force at a
date to be agreed upon, and is to remain in
force until August 20, 1940, and thereafter,
subject to six months' notice by either Government. Reductions in duty on United Kingdom products became effective at midnight
February 25, when article 9 and schedule E of
the 1932 agreement were, by agreement with
the Government of the United Kingdom, replaced by articles 6, 7 and 8 and schedules IV
and V of the new agreement.
These are the advantages secured by Canada:
(a) Continuance of unrestricted free entry
for all products except those which had been
reserved under the 1932 agreement.

233

(b) Guarantee of margins of preference on
scheduled list, including lumber, canned salmon, apples, dairy produce, tobacco and
patent leather.
(c) Reductions in rate on natural silk stockings, and guarantee against any increase in
duty on motor cars and parts.
(d) Assurance of opportunity for expansion
of bacon and ham exports to annual maximum
of 280,000,000 pounds.
(e) Safeguarding of exports of cattle and
meat within framework of United Kingdom
programme for regulation of meat supplies.
The advantages secured by the United
Kingdom are as follows:
(a) Reduction in the Canadian customs
duties on commodities under 179 tariff items.
These include reduced rates, or free entry, on
textiles, including those of wool, cotton, silk
and artificial silk, as well as on clothing and
wearing apparel, knitted goods of all kinds,
blankets and carpets; on glass tableware and
cut glass; on various primary forms of iron
and steel, and on a wide range of processed
steel goods, including machinery, vacuum
cleaners and sewing machines, enamelled ware
and electrical goods; on leather and leather
products; on boots and shoes; on numerous
paper products; and on paints and varnishes,
earthenware, canned fish, soaps, brushes and
silverware.
(b) Guarantee against upward revision of
existing British preferential rates on commodities dutiable under 246 items of the
Canadian Tariff. These bound rates may be
reduced. but cannot be increased during the
term of the agreement.
(c) Guarantee that margins of preference
in favour of United Kingdom goods under
91 items of the Canadian Tariff shall not be
reduced. Except as regards certain primary
steel products (enumerated under 23 tariff
items), this commitment to maintain fixed
margins in favour of United Kingdom goods
relates almost entirely to products not of a
class or kind made in Canada. Important
commodities upon which fixed margins are
covenanted include various chemicals, vegetable oils, window and plate glass, printing
presses, diesel engines, X-ray apparatus, cotton
yarns for mercerizing, linen fabrics, anthracite
coal, wide steel plate, .tin-plate, galvanized
sheets, black steel sheets for galvanizing or
tinning, steel wire and finished structural steel.
Of course, when there is a reduction of duties
on certain items, the industries concerned fear
that they may be prejudiced; but I do not
think any Canadian industries will be adversely
affected by this convention. We all know that
the Ottawa convention did not give British industries the openings in our markets that

234

SENATE

they hoped to have; while we on our side
considerably improved our position in the
British market. It is recognized that no trade
agreement can be arrived at without mutual
concessions, and I am under the impression
that in Great Britain as well as in Canada the
agreement generally has been well received.
It lias been in operation since the budget
speech was delivered, and I have yet to hear
of any dissatisfaction with its operation.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, I have always been a profound
admirer of wliat are known now as the Ottawa
agreements. I can say that with all the more
emphasis because, although a member of the
Government, I had absolutely nothing to do
with their negotiation myself. They are, in
my judgment. the best achievement for this
Dominion that has been effected for many a
decade.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The achievement of 1932 was a tremendous thing. It was
the great starting point of recovery from the
depression. I do not want to modify my
language a whit in expressing truc and earnest
appreciation of the great thing that was done
at that time. Besides boing great in itself,
it inaugurated a policy of mutual preference.
It adopted and embedded in our system a new
principle, and it lias contributed tremendously
not on]y to the rehabilitation of trade within
the Empire, but to the strength of the bonds
of the Empire itself.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Now, even
though at this time we did not feel friendly
to the variations made in the treaty and
embedded in the arrangement before us for
approval, this House would certainly bc very
chary about defcating the measure. Certainly
we would not amend it. But the variations
are not sucl as even to challenge our contention. The Bill is a sufficiently faithful
photograph of the measuire of 1932 to warrant everyone in this Hoiuse, of whiatever
party. supporting it. There are a few chiselter.
Tire is just a little
ings lere and
touching up around tlie eyes and the mouth,
but if you stand six feet away you cannot tell
this measure from the one passed in 1932;
and we approve it with all the more alacrity
because we stand in the shadow of what
mighft have been. For four years we stood and
shivered under the threat of cancellation of
treaties, of a new Government wiping them
laving escaped that fate, we
off the slate.

changes, though on the merits I do not think
they are an improvement at all. I thoroughly
support the measure, and would have supported it had I been in the other House, but
in essence it is nothing more than Parliament's
approval-four years after-of what was donc
in 1932.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not intend
to lessen in the slightest the pleasure of my
right honourable friend in reviewing this
measure. I simprly desire to say that, comcrnment

yes; for the riglt honourable gentleman
iimsclf declared that lie had taken no part
in the making of tie convention.
I desire to remind him of the fact that it
was Sir Wilfrid Laurier and Mr. Fielding who
first placed on the Statute Book a preference
for British goods-to the tune of 333 per cent
and tîat ail parties liad to await the day
when the British Parliament would decide to
impose duties on foreign goods. It was only
after tîat action had been taken that the
Government of Canada was enabled to say:
liaive waitd all the yars from 1897
"
until now; we liave given you a liberal preference; it is time for you to show sone appreciation of oui action.'' I mention thbis simply to
that since 1897 there lias ben no differslio
ence of opiiion in Canada as to the advantage
that woiuld accrue if Gret Britain could give
us a preference.

Righlit Hon. Mir. MEIGHEN: Why did my
honourable friend's friends vote against the
agereementrs?
Hon. Mr. DANDURA\ND: I shall not go
into the detail of ilie reasons wliy the matter
was opposed. I only recall the fact that tlere
have been two trends of thouglit in Canada,
two policies since, I would say, 1878-high
dutios and lower duties. I liave often affirmed
fhat there was no free trade party in Canada.
After the Conservative party had declared
itself in faveur of ligh protection tIere was
a fair tariff or fair frade policy party. I
remiciber that we wient to the petople-I think
in 1908-with Sir Robert Borden's delightful
expression " adequate protection " ringing in
our ears--an expression whiicli did not bind
him to a high tariff at all. We have been
discussing tariffs for a number of years, and I
can quite conceive that the suggestion of Mr.
Baldwin at the opening of the conference in
Ottawa would have been met by the liberal

235

MARCH 30, 1937
policy of the fair traders, who did net stand
for high tariffs and who would have welcomed
reciprocity on a low scale of duties. I confess
that I do net recall all the objections raised
to the treaty, but I am happy to find that this
is a love feast and that the Bill is to pass
unanimously.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I am not taking exception to the

I seem te recall the honourable member saying
there was not entire satisfaction in England
with the results of the last treaty.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not think I
said that. It may have been in my mind.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think it was
in the mind of the honourable gentleman.
Less than a week ago I read an article by the
Hon. Mr. Amery in which he gave exact
figures as to the increase of British exports
to the Dominions, and of Canadian exports te
Britain.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

I read it.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If there is
anything of advantage on the one side or the
other,, I think it is on the side of England.
The percentage in her case was just as great
as in ours. There was nothing of the onesided character which, it was said, was going
te give rise to friction between the Motherland and the Dominion. The treaty was
pronouncedly and permanently beneficial to
both parties to the bargain.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM moved the
second reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, I am glad
to sponsor the Bill, though I cannot just see
why I am linked with this mass production.
The appearance of these little folks has resulted in something new even in legislation.
Under Ontario statutes a board of guardians
was appointed for the quintuplets and has been
acting since their birth. I have read that
a large amount of money, somewhere around
$800,000, has been realized by the guardians
through the use of the children's names, and
so on. It now happens that he Cormmissioner
of Patents ait Ottawa has been asked to give

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Yes, but of
course honourable gentlemen are not so much
interested in those as in whiskies. The
guardians now ask Parliament to pass legislation to vest the words "Quins," "Quints,"
"Quintuplets," or any other word or words
that might mean the Dionne quintuplets, in
the guardians. This Bill has been introduced
for the purpose, I think, of preventing any

Bill 56, an Act respecting the appointment
of Auditors for National Railways.-Hon. Mr.

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable seniators, this Bill
concerns the appointment of auditors for the
Canadian National Railways by joint resolution of the Senate and House of Commons.
The single clause of the Bill reads:
Notwithstanding the provisions of section
thirteen of The Canadian National-Canadian
Pacifie Act, 1933, chapter thirty-three of the
statutes of 1933, as enacted by section three
of chapter twenty-five of the statutes of 1936,
respecting the appointment of auditors by
joint resolution of the Senate and House of
Commons, George A. Touche and Company, of
the cities of Toronto and Montreal, chartered
accountants, are appointed as independent
auditors for the year 1937, te make a continuous audit under the provisions of the said
section, of the accounts of National Railways
as defined in the said Act.
We passed a similar Bill last session and, I
think, every session for some years back.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Are the auditors mentioned in this Bill the gentlemen who are
responsible for Bill 12, which we had before
us to-night?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I could not say.
I will answer my honourable friend to-morrow.
If I am not mistaken, these auditors recommended to the Government once a new set-up
of Canadian National finances.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I hope I may
not be considered impertinent if I suggest we
try to avoid that word "set-up." It is an
awful word to use in the statutes.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It is, I agree.
But many business men find it is a convenient terrn to use. -I do not know just what
they mean by it.

ORDER FOR SECOND READING
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senators, with leave I move that the motion
for second reading be placed on the Order
Paper for to-morrow.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am quite in
favour of the motion and I have no objection
to the Bill. But I suggest that there will be
some amendments needed.
I think there
should be a definition of "friendly foreign
state," and that parts of the measure should
be modified to comply with that definition.
A friendly state is, of course, a state which is
at peace with our country, and that is so
defined.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My attention
had not been drawn to that feature of the
Bill. I should be inclined to think that there
could be but two classes of nations: those
with whom we are at peace and those with
whom we are not at peace. I shall examine
into the Bill and sec what the terni "friendly
foreign state" means.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I think this is an
appropriate occasion to point out that we
were not a party to the Lausanne Treaty that
King George made with Turkey. We would
not have anything to do with that, if I
remember rightly. So we are not friendly
with the Turks at present. They do not
know that we are still at war with them, I
suppose, and I doubt whether many people
in Canada know it.
lon. Mr. BARNARD:
I would suggest
that the bonourable leader of the House corne
armcd with information to-morrow as to the
extent of the evil which the Bill seeks to
cure.
I shall try to
lon. Mr. DANDURAND:
obtain that information. And I may say for
the benefit of my honourable friend to my

has heen clearly shown we are at peace with
Turkey.

It is provided that for sueh purposes the

outstanding of the securities which by the Bill
the National Company is authorized to issue
from time to time shall not exceed the sum
of $30,721,700, being the total of the items
therein set out.
The Minister of Finance may make loans
for refunding and capital expenditures.
The National Company may aid in any
manner any other of the companies, and may
for its own requirements and also for the
requirements of any other of the companies
from time to time apply the proceeds of any
issue of securities in meeting authorized
expenditures on its own account or on account
of any other of those companies.
Then follow the form and terms and method
of the guarantee.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, the Bill contains nothing
very unusual-that is, to those of us who
are accustomed to seeing this form of bill
year after year.
This Bill, however, does something more
than I have been able 'to gaither from the explanation given by the honourable leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand).
It provides that the Canadian National may
issue its securities for the refunding of capital
expenditures and, as well, that the Minister
of Finance may make loans to the Canadian
National direct for refunding and capital expenditures. It also provides that the Canadian National, having received the moneywhether fron the proceeds of its own bonds
or direct from the Government, which borrows
the money for the purpose of lending it-may
distribute it among the company's subsidiaries
and itself according to need. The Bill provides further that the Governor in Council,
in respect of any moneys which the Canadian
National raises by way of bond issue, may
guarantee the bonds, and may determine as to
the character of the guarantee, the terms, and
so forth. The proceeds are to go to the Minister of Finance in trust for distribution in
the usual way.
I do not doubt at all that the Bill must
be passed. But if I have properly appreciated the other Bill which we had under
discussion for a few minutes to-night, establishing a new balance sheet for the Canadian
National Railways, I think it would be well
for honourable members to keep in mind
that if we advance the money it will no
longer be an obligation of the Canadian
National Railways to us. It will be found
by anyone who is able to locate some securities trust, and will appear in the balance

sheet under the title of a proprietor's equity,
and yet look for all the world like a distributable surplus!
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It will not be.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

FIRST READING

Fisheries Research Board of Canada.
The Bill was read the first time.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Second reading

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Would the
honourable leader be good enough to tell
us something about this Bill?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable member wishes to have some indication of the purpose of the Bill. A bill was
passed in 1930 to establish a Biological Board
for the purpose of conducting certain investigations. This Bill repeals that measure, and
replaces the Biological Board with a Fisheries
Research Board, to be differently constituted.
Of the fifteen members of the new board
two are to be appointed by the Government
from the Department of Fisheries, two are to
represent the fishing industry on the Atlantic
coast, and two others the fishing industry on
the Pacifie coast, and the universities are to
have certain representation. The board is to
make researches in the fishing industry. Its
members are to receive no salaries for their
services, but are to be paid for travelling
and other expenses. The chairman and the
secretary, if not officers of the department,
are to be remunerated as the Minister may

APPROPRIATION BILL No. 2
FIRST READING
A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 82, an Act for granting to
His Majesty certain sums of money for the
public service of the financial year ending
31st March, 1937.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable senators, this is Appropriation Bill No. 2. It provides for the
payrnent of a sum not exceeding in the whole
$40,903,880 towards defraying the several
charges and cpenses of the public service,
from the lst day of April, 1936, to the 31st
day of March, 1937, not otherwise provided
for, set forth in the schedule of flic Bill. The
schedule indicates the amounts to be paid,
based on further supplementary estimates. The
amount hereby granted is the total of the items
in the estimates as contained in the scheduie. Honourable members will notice that
this is for supplemen-tary estimates covering
expenditure up to this date, the 31st of March,
1937.
With this short explanation I move the
second reading of the Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I was struck,
indeed horrified, when the figure of forty odd
million dollars was given by the honourable
leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) as the amount of supplementary estimates for the year closing to-day.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: And no election in
eight.
Righat Hon. M\r. GRAHAM.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And, as the
honourable senator says, no election in sight.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Perhaps my
righ.t honourable friend will find the principal
items when running through the list.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am running through the list right now. It is only
within the last few seconds that the Bill
bas heen placed in my hands. Forty millions is an appalling amount to come as
supplementary estimates for a year which
is now virtually closed. I used to become
utterly discouraged, even under other governments, at the freedom with which these tremendous sums were requested. Now, when
we are seeking to get into something more
like a balanced position. the submission of a
figure of this size almost makes one throw up
one's hands and ask. "What is the use?" I
find, for example. on page 7, under Governor
General's warrants, one item of $7,300,000,
another of $4,940,000, and so on; an aggregate there of $12.540,000. J am mentioning
these items not because I think they were
unnecessary, for apparently they were for
relief-no, not altogether, I sec, but the larger
part of this sum was for relief, while part of
it was for other purposes.
I wonder what · houghts are running through
t
the minds of honourable senators opposite.
The previous Administration, knowing that
the extent of visitations of Providence, or
even of relief demands alone, could not be
accurately forecast, asked Parliament for
authority to take care of these situations as
and when they arose. And what cries were
raised throughout the country and in Parliament-not in this House. particularly-about
defiance of the rights of Parliament by blank
cheque legislation! Yet Parliament. of its own
free will, simply gave to the Government
authority to take care of necessities. That
procedure was described as autocracy, usurpation of power and an assault upon our
Constitution. But what method is employed
by this Government, whose head is the man
who chiefly made those charges? This Administration says, "We will not ask Parliament for authority at all, but when needs
arise we shall look after them by Governor
General's warrants, without authority of Parliament." Plainly and truthfully, the doctrine
set up is this: it is a defiance of the rights
of Parliament to act in pursuance, of a statute,
but it is full compliance with and obedience
to the rights of Parliament to act without
any statute whatever. That is exactly the
way this Government has acted.
Would it not be a little better, a little
more parliamentary, and show a little more

MARCU 31, 1937
regard for the riglits of Parliament, to have
money voted and authýority given before the
Government acts? One would think so; one
would think that the duty of every Government was along that line. But instead of
that the attitude of the present Administration is: "We will nlot ask for authority at
ail. We will just go ahead and make expenditures." Yet the Administration is made up
of the very people who were pleading for the
so-called rights of Parliament just a few
months before. What awful hypocrisy this is!
I know the honourable l'eader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) realizes it is that. I do flot find
fault with a Government for meeting an
emerge.ncy by Governor General's warrant;
sometimes that lias to be done; but these
are ernergency requirements for relief, the
very things for which there should have been
authority, probably a blank authority.

Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Why not esk
to have it voted? Why criticize a Government which did ask for authority?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The amount
voted for the current year was found to be
insufficient.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Then this
Government should have had authority of
Parliament to go beyond the amount, a.s the
previous Government had. The present Government did not get such authority, because
its members had insincerely argued before
that if you did not fix the exact amount when
you got authority you were defying Parliament. That is the only rea.son. They should
have had authority of Parliament to spend
whatever arnount was necessary, but they
obtained no authority, just went ahead and
spent the money. Then they say, "Beholdl
Look upon us, the angels of constitutional
government?"
It is pretty liard to analyse a Bill like this
in a few seconds. 1 notice one item here of
$17.959,000, which is "the Dominion's contribution to a programme of adjusting 'the indebtedness of farmers living in the drought
area of Saskatchewan."

Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Not authorized, were they?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Read at the bottom.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Perhaps they
were. But under the authority of what Acts?
It is impossible for anyone to attempt even
to outline -to the House the exact authority,
if there was any. I arn disposed ýto think it
is quite proper that this item should lie here.
But, with respect to relief expenditures, the
other course would have been better. If there
should be any reason 'to take exception to
these, that could be done later. I have no
objection to the second reading, with the third
reading postponed until to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We have been
inforrned that the deputy of the Governor
General will be here this afternoon 'to give
the Royal Assent.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not like
voting for something that I have not had
time to study or even to read attentively.
Could third reading be postponed for haîf an
hour?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, yes. We
miglit pass second reading now and postpone
third reading for, say, an hour, or until my
honourable friend from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr.
Duff) haa beeu heard on the naval question.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We hope lie
will be more than an hour.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

before we start another fiscal year, as we
shall to-morrow, we should have this Bill

1 arn quite sure that my honourable friend
bas enough confidence in the members on both
aides of the bouse of Commons to abide by
their judgment. The measure was passed
there in fifteen minutes. after but a brief
inýquiry or statemnent made by the rigbt honourable leader of the Opposition, I think,
suggesting that the Goveroment had followed
a course whicb apparently had ben denounced
by the Liberal party when it was in opposition. That was ail. 1 arn quite sure that if
my bonourable friend were to ponder over the
Bill for a week hie would agree it sbould pass.
Perbaps hie would settle with bis conscience
by saying, "On dlivision," but I doubt whetber
hie would make even that reservation.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: My objection is not at
ahi on the ground sugg-ested by the honourable
leader. We are continually receiving buis,
at opportune an.d inopportun- times, with the
request to put them through without consideration. This is a special type of bill, and
I agree witb whiit the honourable gentleman
bas said about it, but that. dees not affect
the principhe which 1 arn urging should be
maintained, that this House sbould receive
legisiation in time to give bonourable members an opportunity of considering it. We

DISCUSSION

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from March 16 the
adjourned debate on the question proposed
by Hon. Mr. Ballantyne:
That be will call the attention of the Senate
to the training of naval cadets and the elosing
of the Naval College, and also to the sale
of the training ship Aurora.
Hon. WILLIAM DUFF: Honourable senators, a few days ago we had the privilege
of listening to a most excellent speech by
the honourable senator from Alma (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne), a gentleman who during bis
term as Minister of Naval Affairs had perliaps-and I say this, of course, with due
deference to my fellow members-a better
opportunity than anybody else in this Chamber
or elsewhere of sizing up the situation with
regard to naval matters. I am sure we all
appreciated the excellent speech which my
honourable friend made. While, with his usual
modesty, my honourable friend stated only
that ho would call the attention of the Senate
to the training of naval cadets and the closing of the Naval College, I think I am right

MARCH 31, 1937
in saying it was his intention that we should
deal with a matter of most vital importance
to this country.
We also had the privilege of hearing three
other speeches on this subject. I must apologize
to the House for my failure to follow my
honourable friend from Alma (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne). This was due to the fact that I
lost my voice for a considerable time. I was
quite willing to give way to the honourable
member from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach), of whose brilliant career and record
during the War we are all proud, and to the
honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Macdonell), and the honourable senator from
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae), who also had
most enviable records. We listened with
pleasure to the remarks of these gentlemen
while they discussed this important matter.
Now that I have an opportunity of following these distinguished gentlemen I feel
that I am placed in a rather embarrassing
position because of the fact that I have not
had the exoerience of the honourable senator
from Alma (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne), who, as
a Privy Councillor of this country, was closely
associated with naval matters during a serious
time in our history, and because, by reason
of my age, I was unable to take any part
in the great adventure overseas from 1914 to
1918. Nevertheless, I think this is a time
when all of us should do something or say
something with regard to naval affairs in
this country. In the light of my experience
in politics and in business during the last
forty years I think that in order to arrive
at a proper conclusion I should take honourable members of the Senate back to certain
events which occurred in this country in the
past.
Perhaps our first venture with respect to
the defence of the Empire, which we all love,
was made in 1899, when England was compelled to take part in what was known as
the Boer War. At that time the people and
the Parliament of this country decided that
we owed something to Great Britain, and
consequently a contingent was sent from Canada to help the Mother Country in ber struggle
with the Boers in South Africa. A few years
later, after several Imperial conferences had
been held in London, the Government of
the day, in which Sir Erederick Borden was
Minister of Militia, introduced into Parliament a measure proposing that we should
take over the defence of this country as far
as we could; and in 1904 an Act was passed
authorizing the upkeep and maintenance of
the fortifications at Halifax and Esquimalt
and the taking over of the naval dockyards
at those two places.

·

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In 1910, was
it not?
Hon. Mr. DUFF: The Act that authorized
the taking over of the fortifications and the
defences on both coasts was passed in 1904.
A few years later, after the British regiments
had left this country and Canadian militiamen had taken charge, and subsequent ta the
Imperial Conference of 1908,, it was felt that
perhaps Canada should do even more towards
defending her *own coast-lines aind assisting
the Britishi Empire. In 1909 Sir George
Foster-that great statesman, now dead, who
occupied a prominent place in this Chamber
for many years-either because of his politioal acumen or because he had received a
hint from somewhere that the then Government intended to do something with regard to
the naval defence of this country, moved a
resolution in the House of Commons on the
29th of March. Sir George, perhaps one of
the most cloquent speakers this country has
ever known, and a man who had the interest
of the British Empire and of Canada at heart,
feeling that it was the duty of all Canadians
to stand by the British Empire, moved this
resolution:
That in the opinion of this House, in view
of her great and varied resources, of her
geographical position and national environments, and of that spirit of self-help and selfrespect which alone befits a strong and growing
people, Canada should no longer delay in assuming her proper share of the responsibility
and financial burden incident to the suitable
protection of her exposed coast-line and great
seaports.
In moving that splendid motion Sir George
went on to say:
The first and greatest objection which I
have to a fixed money contribution is that it
bears the aspect of hiring somebody else to
do what we ourselves ought to do; as though
a man, the father of a family, in lusty health
and strength, should pay his neighbour something per month for looking after the welfare
and safety of his home instead of doing that
duty himself. That seems to me, when you
work it out, to be a basic objection to this
form of aid. It gnes still further than that.
Suppose you contribute this year your sum,
and next year your equal sum, and thereafter
year after year. After ten or twelve, or
twenty, or thirty years, you will have paid out
an immense amount of money. You will have
been protected in the meantime; but in Canada
itself there will be no roots struck, there will
be no residue left, there will be no preparation of the soil, or beginning of the growth
of the product of defence. Yet some time or
other, no one can doubt that with resources
and with a population constantly increasing,
we must and will have in this country a naval
force of our own for our coast and home defence.
These were noble sentiments.

SENATE
In reply Sir Wilfrid Laurier, who was the
leader of bis party in this country for many
years, and whom I and thousands of others
regarded with great respect and adoration, said
this:
We are British subjects. Canada is one of
the daughter nations of the Empire and we
realize to the full the rights and obligations
which are involved in that proud title. It
bas been, it is, it shall be our unalterable
determination to meet and to carry out every
duty which is implied by the title of "British
subject."
May I say that only last week, after a period
of thirty years, these sentiments of Sir Wilfrid
Laurier were acknowledged in another place in
this building. These are the words of a man
who during the 1911 election was described in
the English-speaking provinces as disloyal to
the British Empire, and who in his own province was said to be a traitor to his race and
creed. In these days even his opponents admit
tha,t ie was right.
Sir Wilfrid Laurier went on to say:
Nay, more, not only will Canada fulfil every
obligation which is implied by that title, but
I think I may make bold to say that we will
rise to every sacrifice that may be needed in
order to maintain unimpaired the rank and
status which is occupied by Canada in the
British Empire and the rank and status whicih
is occupied by the British Empire throughout
the world.
Then Sir Wilfrid Laurier, after quoting from
the report of the Imperial Conference of 1902,
said:
The Canadian Ministers who were present
attending that conference did not view that
project with any favour.
He is referring now to the giving of a contribution to the British Navy.
They received it with respect, but they
declined to accept it, and they presented their
views in a state paper wierein they stated
what they were prepared to do so far as
Canada is concerned. Their views thus stated
have often been quoted in this House, but I
think it is opportune that I should quote thema
again. This is the statement:
"At present Canadian expenditures for defence services are confined to the military side.
The Canadian Government are prepared to
consider the naval side of defence as wxell.
On the sea coasts of Canada there is a large
number of mcn adsnirably qualified to forn
a naval reserve, and it is loped thrat at an
early day a system rmay be devised which will
lead to the training of these men and te the
making of their services available for defence
in time of need."
In conclusion the Ministers repeat that, while
the Canadian Government are obliged to dissent
from the measures proposed, they fully appreciate the obligation of the Dominion to maike
expenditures for the purpose of defence in
proportion to the increasing population and
wealth of the country. They are willing that
these expenditures shall be so directed as to
eMother Country
relieve the taxpayer of the
Hon. Mr. DUFF.

from some of the burdens which be now bears;
and they have the strongest desire to carry out
their defence schremes in co-operation with the
Imperial authorities and under the advice of
experienced Imperial officers, so far as this is
consistent with the principle of local selfgovernment, which bas proved se great a factor
in the promotion of Imperial unity.
Then, after this matter was discussed,
Sir Wilfrid Laurier moved the following
resolution:
The House fully recognizes the duty of the
people of Canada, as they increase in numbers
and wealth, to assume in larger measure the
responsibilities of national defence.
The House reaffirms the opinion, repeatedly
expressed by representatives of Canada, that
under the present constitutional relations between the Mother Country and the self-governing dominions the payment of any stated contribution to the Imperial treasury for naval
and military purposes would not, so far as
Canada is concerned, be a satisfactory solution
of the question of defence.
The House has observed with satisfaction
the relief afforded in recent years to the taxpayers of the United Kingdom through the
assumption by the Canadian people of considerable military expenditure formerly charged
upon the Imperial treasury.
Tie fHouse will cordially approve of any
necessary expenditure designed to promote the
organization of a Canadian naval service in
co-operation with and in close relation to the
Imperial Navy, along the lines suggested by
the Admiralty at the last Imperial Conference,
and in full sympathy with the view that the
naval suprenacy of Great Britain is essential
to tte security of commerce. the safety of
the Empire and the peace of the world.
The House expresses its firm conviction
that whenever the need arises the Canadian
people will be found ready and willing to
make any sacrifice that is required to give
to the Imperial authorities the most loyal and
hearty co-operation in every movement for the
maintenance of the integrity and the honour
of the Empire.
Now, Sir Wilfrid Laurier was not the only
one who expressed these views. Not only Sir
George Foster, but also Sir Robert Borden
said during the debate that it was necessary
that something should be done for the naval
defence of this country. While I should like
to read part of Sir Wilfrid Laurier's speech,
perhaps the resolution is sufficient. So I will
content nyself with reading what was said
by Sir Robert Borden. a Nova Scotian who
for many years had taken a great interest
in public affairs in this country. and who
afterwards was Prime Minister. Here are his
words:
I come now to a consideration of the resolution whicls ias been moved by the riglst
tonourable the Prime Minister, and I will
say that witi many portions of it J am in entire
synpathy. But I would like to make one or
two suggestions to the right honourable gentleman, and I do not make them in any party
spirit or in any carping spirit, because if
there is one thing more than another that I

MARCH 31, 1937
would desire it is that the policy of Canada
on this great question, and the resolution announcing it, should meet with the absolute
and unanimous approval of this Parliament
and of the country.
'What suggestions I have to make, I make
with the sincere desire that we xnay shape a
resolution of whicb we can ail approve and
whicb shail go forth ta the world as a ringing
declaration that if the mather of nations bas
to fight the battie of bier if e, the people of
Canada witbout distinction of party or of
creed will stand by bier side in that figbt.
This is toa great a question for the introduction of party strategy; it le a question in
respect of which we should ail rise superior
to aIl party motives, and so 1 purpose making
to my rigbt honourable friend one or two suggestions which I K-now hie will receive in tbe
spirit in whjch I make tbem.
The resuit was that Sir Wilfrid and Sir
Robert got together, Sir Wilfrid's resolution
was amended and the House unenimously
adopted a resolution, saying thiat Canada should
-tiake part in. t.he defence not, onily of hber own
shores, but also of the British Empire as a
whole, and that we should have a navy in
this country. Because we had unanimity in
this country as to what we should do regarding naval affairs at that timýe, the Liberal
Government, or perhaps the then Minister of
Naval Affairs, communicated with Great
Britain and she put at our service the cruisers
Niobe and Rainbow. The Niobe was a ship
which had seen service in the British Navy,
yet was still well suited for thbe purpoee, of
training our young men. She came to this
country in 1910 and was stationed at Halifax,
while the Rainbow went to the Pacific coast
and was stationed at Esquimaît.
The election was over. 1 dû not need to
dwell on what happened at that election in
1911. At that time, I, like a great many
others in this country, was a partisan. I took
part in that election as a supporter of the
man whom I regard as this country's greatest
statesmýen, Sir Wilfrid Laurier. I have neyer
been ashamed of the support I gave ta my
leader then., any more than any member of the
other party need be ashamed of the support
hie gave ta bis leader. But it is tû be regretted, and especially at this time, that that
eleetion was not fought on the resolution I
have read with regard to, the Canadian Navy.
Other things came up, with the resuit that Sir
Wilfrid Laurier, a man who had given bis life
ta the public service of the country, was referred to in the English provinces as an enemy
of Great Britaîn, and in hîs own province of
Quebec as a traitor ta bis race and creed.
At that election, for some reason best known
to themselves, certain people decided to go
back on what they agreed to during the
parliamentary discussion in 1909.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Will the
honourable gentleman pardon me? I do not
doubt for a moment that hie is speaking in
good faith. But I do want to say this and
have it on the record. I took part in that
election, in more than one province, and I
neyer at any time heard anything of that
nature said with reference ko Sir Wilfrid
Laurier in any province. It may have been
said-no one could say it neyer was said-hut
I can say, certainly, that it neyer was said with
the approval of the Conservative leader or
of anyone of any importance in the Conservative party.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: "La maudite marine
à. Laurier."
Hon. Mr. DANDURA.ND: We can only
speak of things as we ourselves know them.
I have had occasion more than once ta say
in this House that the Nationalist movement
in the province of Quebec, which carried
twenty-five seats by the slogan, "Nýo contribution towards Imperial wars except for the
defence of Canada," was conducted under the
banner of Mr. Bourassa and Mr. Monk, a
lieutenant of Mr. Robert Borden, and financed
f rom A ko Z by the Conservative party.
Right Hon. M.r. MEIGHEN: I think the
honourable gentleman had better not bave
made that statement, for hie does not know
the faots and I do not think hoe is correct.
However, I was not speaking an that point.
I rose merely ta, make the one statement,
be-cause I did noýt think what the honourable
gentleman from Lunenburg (Han. Mr. Duif)
was saying was fair ta the provinces conoerned.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: 0f course, I understand
that my right honourable friend would not
stoop ta, those taotics.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: What the honourable
gentleman from Lunenburg said was surely
correct so far as Quebec is concerned.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: And se, far as the Engiishspeaking provinces ore conceied I know of
my own knowledge tha-t because Sir Wilfrid
Laurier tried ta make an agreement with the
United States under whîch. aur fish, among
other things, could be sent ta that country
free of duty, hýe was held up as an eneýmy ta
Great Britaîn; and because hie was willing ta
contribute ta the British Navy hie was held
up in bis own province as a traitor. I think
perhaps the greatest tribute that was ever paid
ta Sir Wilfrid Laurier was paid a week ago,
when the leader of the great Conservative
party of this country was man enough ta sîiy,

SENATE

virtually, that, after all, Sir Wilfrid's programme for the defence of Canada was the
right one.
As I was saying, honourable senators, the
election was over, and ftrom that time until
1914 nothing was done to extend the naval
defence of this country. We had the Niobe
in the dockyard at Hýalifax and the Rainbow
at Esquimalt, and when the War broke out
in 1914 those ships were tied up at their docks,
with the result tînt there sailed from Montreal a ship called the "Kronprinzessin Cecile"
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I know the
honourable gentleman always wants to be
fair, and so I may be permitted te point out
that the Rainbow, on the Pacifie coast, certainly was in commission and was cruising
around looking for German cruisers which were
in that district at the time. It was net until
some years later that the Rainbow was turned
into a depet ship.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I am afraid my bonourable friend is not referring to the same date
that I am. I was dealing with the situation
when the War broke out.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

That

Hon. Mr. DUFF: The Rainbow was net in

ship sailed from Vancouver with $3,000.000 of
gold in her strong box and a cargo for Germany, and the Rainbow was not in position to
go out from Victoria.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I feel sure my
honourable friend will be willing te take my
word for it that the Rainbow was in commission at the time, and if he will communicate with the Department of National Defence
he will be able to confirm that she remained in
commission for a long time after war broke
out.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: May I draw to
the attention of my honourable friend this
statement. made in the House of Commons
by Sir Wilfrid Laurier on the 19th of August,
1914, fifteen days after the outbreak of war:
We know that one of our battleships on the
Pacifie Las been seeking the eneny, and if se
has not yet engaged him it is because the
eniemy lias eluded lier pursuit.
IIon. Mr. DUFF: Of course, I am very glad
to defer to those who know about this matter.
But it is a well-known fact that up te 1914,
when the War broke out, Canada had done
practically nothing with regard te the naval
defence of this country. One of the two ships
which we had received from the British
Adiiralty in 1910 was perhaps in commission
Hon. Mr. DUFF

.at Esquimalt, as my honourable friend from
Alma (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) says, but everybody in Nova Scotia knows that the Niobe
was not in commission. She was put into
commission about a month or six weeks after
war broke 'out, and thon had to be brought
back to dock again because she was found to
be unfit to be kept at sea. I am not endeavouring to be critical in this matter, because
I think that perhaps both parties have fallen
down as regards the naval defence of this
countrv. If my honourable friend from Alma
will wait a moment or two I shall pay him
perhaps one of the greatest compliments ever
paid to a public mai in this country. It is
my belief that if bu had been taken into the
Covernmnent in 1911, instead of in 1917, our
naval defence would net have been in the
condition it was in wien war broke out.
When my honourable friend took charge, in
1917, ho was faced with an extremelv difficult
situation. While I criticized him in another
place, because he happened to be at the time
the Minister of Naval Affairs, I wxant to say
to him now that le was not responsible for
the condition of our naval defence.
That
condition was apparently due to the fact
that for sorne reason or other no attempt
was made from 1914 to 1917 to provide for
our own naval defnce. and we iad to depend
upon the United States and Japan to protect
our shores.
Now, honourable senators, we come to the
time when the War was over, and when my
honourable friend from Alma was still Minister
of Naval Affairs. Becaiuse of bis responsibilities h thouîght that he should consult
the British Government or that it should
consult him with regard to the defunce of
Canada. And in 1920 Be read to the louse of
Commons a memorandum in which lie said:
The Governiîent has Ladiinder consideration
for sonie timîee the question of the naval defence
of Canada, and the suggestion of Adiiiral
Viscounct Jellicoe in reference thereto.
In view of Canada's heavy financial commitnents and of the fact iat Great Britain has
not, as yet, decided on lier peiranent naval
pol icy, and of the approaching Imuperial Conference at which the iquestion of naval defence
of the Empire will come uip for discussion
between the Home Goveriimeit and the Overseas Dominions, it leas been decided to defer
in the nieantine action in regard to the adoption
of a permanent naval policy for Canada.
The Governeîuent has decided to carry on the
Canadian naval service along pre-war linesI presume that meant along Sir Wilfrid's lines.
-and lias accepted the offer of Great Britain
of one liglt cruiser and two torpedo boat
destroyers to take the place of the present
obsolete and useless training ships, the Niobe
and the Rainbow.
Hon Mr. BALLANTYNE: Hear, hear.

MARCH 31, 1937
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I agree with that. It goes
on:
The Minister of Naval Service, in order to
be free to thoroughly reorganize and place the
present service on an economical and efficient
basis, has issued orders for the demobilization
of all officers and naval ratings and for the
discontinuance of civilian help at headquarters,
and at the naval dockyards in Esquimalt and
Halifax. The Canadian officers who are in
the Imperial Fleet and who are now being paid
by the Canadian Government will be recalled
and placed on duty with the Canadian naval
service.
The Naval College will also be
continued.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. DUFF:
After reorganization has been completed,
oniy those officers and other ratings and civilians
will be taken on who are absolutely necessary
and possess the qualifications desired.

It may be asked why after 1920 the Government

of this country decided

that the

Naval 'College should be closed and the
splendid ship which my honourable friend had
got from the British Government should be
scrapped. I am not quite sure that either
party should receive any praise with regard
to these matters. During the years 1917 to
1920 I made a number of speeches in the
House of Commons, in which I expressed the
opinion that it was not ne.cessary to spend
very much money for naval services, and
indeed that we could not afford to spend very
much. Yet I do not think that one Government is more to blame, or is deserving of
more credit, than the other. The Government which was in power before 1920 scrapped
the Niobe and the Rainbow and the submarines CC-1 and CC-2; and when the
Liberal party came into power at the end of
1921 it scrapped that splendid cruiser, the
Aurora, which my honourable friend from
Alma had arranged to get from the British
Government. He had arranged to get not
only that ship, but also the Patriot and the
Patricia, two very excellent cruisers, and the
submarines CH-14 and CH-15.
Perhaps the Senate will agree with me that
in 1918, after the War was over, when the
soldiers had come back from overseas, we felt
justified in thinking that we had participated
in a war to end war, a war to make the world
safe for democracy. This country had made
immense sacrifices. We had sent 600,000 men
overseas, and 60,000 of them were buried on
the fields of Flanders. We had incurred
a debt of two billions of dollars and
arranged for a pension scheme involving
some $50,000,000. So perhaps it was only
reasonable that the Government of which my
honourable friend from Alma was a member,
and the Government that succeeded it, should

251

think that it was time "to beat our swords
into ploughshares and our spears into pruning
hooks." While my honourable friend regrets
that the Aurora, that very fine training ship,
was scrapped after 1922, and the Naval
College was closed, yet I do not think any
one party should be blamed, because all of
us alike had good reason to hope and feel that
there would be no more war in the future.
Now, honourable senators, perhaps it may
be well to show here just what naval expenditures we have made for some years back. I
have a statement of the figures before me, but
instead of reading them all I will ask permission to place them upon Hansard.

Honourable members will observe from these
figures that from 1910 to 1935 succeeding

administrations evidently felt there was not

much necessity for any great expansion of
the Naval Service. I am not criticizing either
one party or the other, but, I say, both Houses
of Parliament endorsed the naval policy of
the Government of the day.

The same remarks apply to appropriations
for national defence purposes-Militia, Naval,
and Air Services-from the fiscal year 1926-27
up to the present fiscal year, 1937-38. I submit
a statement showing these appropriations for
each of the fiscal years during that period.

NoTE: (a)-"Air Services" include Civil Aviation and Civil Government Air
Operations, except in 1937-38: Civil Aviation is now with Department of Transport.
Honourable members will notice that the
appropriations during the fiscal years 193233, 1933-34 and 1934-35 were lower than those
for the other years. The reason is apparent.
During those years we were passing through
a grave depression; and, besides, we all felt
that there would be no more wars and that
there was no reason why we should increase
our expenditure on Militia, Naval and Air
Services. The increase this year is due to
the fact that for several years the Government allowed the supplies, etc., to get to a
very low ebb.
But to-day, honourable members, this world
is entirely different from what it was several
years ago. Then the Great Powers were sick
of war; to-day we see several of those powers
spending vast sums of money on rearmament
in preparation for war. If we were walking
up the street and saw a mad dog approaching us, we should mn for a gun and shoot
that mad dog. It might be expected that
everybody in this world, and especially in
Europe, would be sick and tired of war, but
in the last two or three years certain dictators
in Europe have sprung up who apparently
are determined. when they think the time
is ripe, to provoke war to further their personal ambitions. Therefore I submit that
not only Canadians and our fellow subjects
in the other parts of the British Empire, but
the Anglo-Saxon rqçe as a whole must take
cognizance of the faet that we are living in a
world very different from what it was between
1920 and 1925. It is our duty, then, as loyal
Canadians and loyal subjects of the British
Empire, in spite of what we may have said
Hon.

Mr. DUFF.

in those years with regard to naval defence,
to decide what we shall do about the defence
of Canada and the Motherland.
With regard ýto land defence we should
not spend one dollar more than is necessary. We shall never be attacked by our
neighbour to the south. In fact the United
States is more dependent upon Canada than
we are upon that country. If Canada or the
United States is ever attacked it will be
from the sea, and, keeping this in mind, we
should seriously consider what is necessary
To-day the Naval Service is

being maintained at its former strength of
four destroyers and four mine sweepers. Just
think 'of it! We have 7,000 miles of eoastline, including indentures, rivers and bays,
from Grand Manan to Hudson Bay, and from
Vancouver Island to Alaska, and to defend
that extensive coast-line we have but four
destroyers and four mine sweepers! Those
four destroyers are the Saguenay and Skeena,
built for the Canadian Government in 1931,
and the St. Laurent and the Fraser, purchased in 1936 from the Imperial Government. In addition to those destroyers we
have one mine sweeper, and four new mine
sweepers are to be built. A training cruiser
is also being built on the Atlantic coast
for the more efficient training of naval recruits.
This ship is intended to take the place of
the Aurora and the Naval College for instructional purposes.
Surely, honourable members, Canada must
do more than this. True, we can never afford
to make expenditures sufficient to provide
for the adequate protection of our own coast-

line. My right honourable friend opposite
will perbaps laugh when I repeat a statement I made in another place in 1920, that
Canada in case of war would have to depend
to a greater or less extent on the Monroe
Doctrine.
Hon. Mr. BAILANTYNE: Neyer!
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Very good. 1 do not
think there is any need for us to blush
or to feel inferior on that account. In my
opinion it is more important to the United
States than even to ourselves that Canada
should neyer be conquered by a European
power. The United States could nlot afford
to allow Canada to be invaded. To prevent
this the United States would either invoke
the Monroe Doctrine or send cruisers to proteot our shores as it did in 1917, after iibhe Wsar
started. Naturally, no one objected then.
Neither was there objection nor ernbarrassment when the Japanese Governrnent sent
cruisers to protect our Pacifie coast. Consequently I do not see why any Canadian
should feel hurniliated by my suggestion that
the Monroe Doctrine may help Canada in
case of another war. I amn willing that we
should go the limit in protecting our own
coast-line; but I go further, and in this I arn
bacloed up by the Miarquess of Lothian. Speiaking in the House of Lords recently, he stated:
If one could get an extension of the Monroe Doctrine and a combination of the democracies under the Monroe system with the
British Commonwealth sufficiently closely integrated so as to be invuinerable and able
to stand outside the vortex of a European
war, one would create a centre of stability
and peace in the world which might exorcize
for ever the spectre of another world war.
Right Hon. M.r. MEIGIEýN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I arn glad my right honourable friend approves that statement. So
do L.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But we have
not that yet.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: What, the Monroe Doctrine?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No; we have
neot whýat is asked for there.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I know we have not; but
is it not sornething we should pray for?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: No. If Canada is ever in jeopardy the Old Country will
dcfend us, as she has always done in the past.
The Hon. Anthony Eden only the other day
said-I do not know whether rny honourable
friend read the statement in the press-that
Great Britain's rearmament programme was
for the preservation and maintenance not only

253

of the United Kîngdom, but of the Empire
as a whole. I sidmire my honourable friend
opposite ver'
nch, but I do not agree with
him when hie says that if this country is in
danger at any tirne we rnust take cover under
the Monroe Doctrine. I say the British authorities will look after us.
Hon. Mr. DUEF: I arn sorry if my honourable friend rnisunderstood me. I did not say
we should take oover under the Monroe Doctrine. I .think I arn as good a Scotchrnan as
hie is-and the Scotchrnan is proud. I should
not want anybody to fight for me, any more
,than my dhonorable friend wouild want aiiybody .to fight for him. But I sa>' that, in the
first place, as hie .must vealize,,in thie event of a
Euix>pean war occu'rning to-morrow we could
not expect the British Navy to protect Canada. It could nlot do so now any more than
it eould in 1914, simply because with the vast
ramifications -of the British Empire it is impossible for Great Britain to protect ail her
colonies and the self-governing Dominions.
What is the use of my honourable friend relying on what the H-on. Anthony Eden or anybody else may say? The British Navy cannot proteet Canada. We mnust proteet ourselves. Not only so, but we must rely upon
-our frieindly neighbour; not beoause t.hat
friendly neighbour desires to protect us, but
because it ýmust protect us in order te proteet
it.self.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: The United States can
neyer a]low a hostile power to corne in by
the back or side door. The Ujnited States'
line for defence purposes extends from Grand
Manan to Belle Isle on the Atlantic and
from the Fraser river to Alaska on the Pacific.
It does not end at Cape Flatter>' and Juan de
Fuca strait on the Pacifie, nor at Grand Manan
and the St. Croix river on the Atlantic. I
really do not think that my honourable friend
and I are very much in disagreernent. I arn
,net sayiqig we should expeet anythhing fromn
the United States which is not our due, but
I do say it is not fair to expect the Mother
Country to protect us if she is ever involved
in another European war and the German
Government or the Italian Government or
some other belligerent power sends submarines te attack our ports and our mercantile marine. I contend that we should defend
ourselves as far as we are able.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIRjHEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. D1JFF: Then, if necessary, we
should have no hesitation in calling upon, or
expecting help from, the United States. We
should not be calling upon our neighbour to

254

heip ourselves alone. The United States weii
knows that by defending us she is defending
hersýeif. Let me remind honourabie members
that 1 do flot; want to humniliate Canada in
any views I have expressed about the Monroe Doctrine. President Roosevelt himself,
at a Chatauqua meeting last fail, said that
the Monroe Doctrine might apply to Canada.

that wýe in 'this western henaisphiene, living

not man them. To-day we have not the men,
and we never shall have men unless some
system is devised by the Parliament of this
country to encourage men 'to go not only into
the navy, but into a practical business that
will make them naval ratings.
What did Sir Wilfrid Laurier say in the
speech he made in 1909? In discussing Canada's
need of a navy he said this:
At present Canadian expenditures for defence services are confined to the military
side. The Canadian Government are prepared
to consider the naval side of defence as well.
On the sea coasts of Canada there is a large
number of men admirably qualified to form a
naval reserve, and it is hoped that at an early
day a system may be devised which will lead
to the training of these men and to the making of their services available for defence in
time of need.
That is what I am coming to right now. If
we are ever going to build up a naval defence
system we must have a policy which will provide men for naval defence. And there is
only one place to get those men.
Hon.

Mr. CASGRAIN:

The province of

Quebec.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Surely. We want the boys
from the north shore of the St. Lawrence to
Red Bay and from the Gaspé coast down to
the Bay of Chaleur, as well as the boys from
the Maritime Provinces.
In order to build up a navy in this country
we must do something-and now I want ta
talk to my honourable friend the leader of
the Government in this Chamber (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand), who has bad a wealth of experience not only in this Chamber, but in the
political and business life of this country. I
arm going to make a proposal that I hope he
will carry to his colleagues in the Government.
I am serious in this. I have no political axe
to grind. I remember that when my honourable friend from Alma (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne)
was Minister of Marine and Fisheries, even
though we were opposed politically, he always
listened to my views because he knew I was
interested in the fisheries of this country.
Therefore I say I want my honourable friend
the leader of the Government in this Chamber
to carry my proposal to the Government. If
the Government and the people of this country
are serions about naval defence, ýthere is only
one source of supply from which men can be
secured, namely, the fishermen and the sons of
fishermen in all the villages from Grand
Manan to Cape North, and up to the St.
Lawrence river and around to Belle Isle, and
on the Pacifie coast from Cape Flattery north
to the Naas river.
My right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) was rather critical, I thought, be-

cause a bill which came before us contained an
item for relief. Perhaps he was right. Also,
when he was arguing in support of the home
improvement plan he spoke of " pri.ming the
pump." Well, it is useless to prime the
pump unless the strainer is clear and the
bilges are free of cotton waste and cinders.
We have spent millions of dollars in the
last eight or nine years to relieve unemployment. My suggestion has two things in view.
One is to provide permanent employment for
thousands of men; the other is to build up a
proper background for a Canadian navy. If
we can afford to spend millions of dollars on
the various items appearing in the supplementary estimates, if we can spend $5,000,000
on a Bank of Canada building on Sparks
street, and another three or four millions on
a Supreme Court building-I am not objecting
to this if we can do it-surely we can afford to
spend money on an industry which is capable
of the greatest of development, more especially
as at the same time we shall be establishing
a naval policy whieh will be a credit to
Canada and will enable us to say that we
are not dependent upon Japan, as we were in
1914, or the United States, as we were in 1916
or 1917. While we are willing to accept the
co-operation of other countries, let us try to
do our bit. I am going to show you where I
think this country could spend money in such
a way as to bring us millions of dollars of new
wealth. My proposal, based entirely on the
fact that we must do something to protect the
sea coasts of this country, is as follows:
In view of the importance of the fishing
industry in waters adjacent to the Atlantic
and Pacifie coasts of Canada, as well as in
the Great Lakes and rivers; and
In view of the fact that this industry is
capable of very great development and largely
increased production; and
In view of the further fact that such development and production and consequent marketing of the various fish products, not only
in Canada, but in the British West Indies
and in foreign markets as well, would cause
millions of new money to find its way into
Canada; and
In view of the further fact that such development and increased production would mean
permanent employmentThis is not like the home improvement plan,
which will give a few days' work to the
plumbers and carpenters. God knows no one
has any use for the plumber.
-would mean permanent employment for thousands of fishermen on the sea, as well as employment for thousands of labourers in the
different fish processing plants on shore, as
well as the stimulation of the shipbuilding
and kindred industries:
It is therefore submitted in the interest of
the whole of the people of Canada and the
economic well-being of the country that the
Government should take immediate steps to

256

vote by Act of Parliament, or in the estimates,
a sum of money not less than five million
dollars foc the purpose of stimxlating the
industry in the following
above-mentioued
mnaner, and iu other ways which may suggest

Where does France get the men for hec
uavy? She gets them from arnong the fishermen of the country. How does she get those
men? For the last fifty years France has
paid a bouinty of $2 for every quintal of fish
caught. If we are gning te build up the
naval defences of this country there is ouly
one way we can man our boats, and that is
tn encourage the fishermen f0 go flshing for
six or more months. thus producing wealfh
which will help f0 pay for the navy, and
during the rest of the year to train on our
ships so that they will be of sorne use in
case of war. If France can do that, we
can do it.
There is no douht that during- the last
seven years the men engaged in the flshing
xndustry have suffered more than those in
any other indusfry in Canada. They have
not complained very rnuch; they took in their
helts and held ou. If fhcy had enough money

that conditions would change and times would

One of the difficulfies with boats and gear
is that they wear out, and if the Governent

capable of greater development than any
other industry in this country. I admire the
present Government and the late Government for the steps they took to rehabilitate
the farmers in the dry areas of the West. They
will get good value for every cent of money
spent on that work. The same can be said
of the fisheries of Canada. If the Government will vote money and lend it for the purchase or construction of boats, millions of
dollars of new wealth will corne into the

people who will take an interest in our naval
affairs.
My proposal continues:
4. That a bounty or an amount equal to $1
per hogslxead on sait be paid or remitted to the
fishermen.
5. That the cust of living to the fishermeu
and the cost of gear and equipment, etc., for
their boats and vesseis, be reduced by lowering
of tariffs and removal of restrictions on gonds
required by the fishermen, coming in from
other countries wlîere the products of the fisheries are now nîarketed; also that the Goverument, in order to encourage outside countries,
make the necessary arrangements so that the
produets of said eountries used in Canada are
adxnitted to this Dominion at the lowest possible
rate of dlity; and aiso remove dumping duties,
regulations, etc.
6. That an organization consisting of business
men whn are interested in the industry, and
of fishermen, be established for the purpose
of enlarging the home and foreign mnarkets.

1 therefore say, honourable senators, that
if we are te build up a navy we mnust al
get together, no matter what our politics may
be.
We must have, not one or two littie
ships, but a navy. I arn not criticizing rny
honeurable friend (Hon. Mc. Dandurand) because we have purchased only two ships, the
St. Liaurent and the Fraser. 1 under9fiand
the difficulties of fthe Government. Neyertheless we must cealize that the tirne has

MARCH 31, 1937
come for all to get together and do something with regard to the defence of our coastline. We may have to do a little less as far
as the militia is concerned, and cut down on
the appropriations for flying, except in so
far as they .rellate to and fit in with naval
affairs. I say the citizens of Canada must be
made to realize that we owe a duty to the
Empire. and I respectfully submit that the
proposal I have made with regard to the development of the fisheries of this country
will do more than anything else towards
building up our haval defences.
I read the other day a book called The
Great Blockade. The author tells the story
of certain naval operations during the War.
While perhaps he gives too much credit to
the seamen who were on the boats engaged
in blockade duties, yet one feels convinced
after reading the story that if it had not
been for those twenty-six or twenty-seven
ships of the merchant marine which were
commandeered by the naval authorities in
Great Britain and which day after day and
night after night for four long years patrolled
the North Sea and kept the Germans from
getting supplies, and if the crews of those
boats had not been good seamen and had not
done their duty, the War would have continued much longer.
Who were the men who made up the crews
of those ships? Read The Big Blockade and
you will find that while, of course, the officers
were taken from the Royal Naval Reserve,
the seamen and those who boarded the German and Norwegian ships that were attempting
to carry goods into Germany were Newfoundland fishermen. It was they who took these
ships into Kirkwall. And I say to honourable members that if there is any class of
people in this country who deserve to be
encouraged it is our fishermen. We can build
up a navy only if the fishing industry of
this country is encouraged. If the Government and Parliament are wise they will at
the earliest possible moment do something
to rehabilitate that industry, which is now
in a very bad condition. It is an industry
capable of contributing hundreds of millions
of dollars of new wealth to this country,
and it is one which does not ask to be given
something for nothing.
I cannot too strongly urge upon honourable senators the fact that encouragement
of the fisheries is necessary for the building
up of a strong naval reserve. I have referred
to the effective part played by Newfoundland fishermen towards saving the Empire
during the War. I do not think it can be
doubted that if we are ever going to build
up a navy our fishermen must be part and

257

parcel of the scheme, so that if guns are
ever fired again-I hope they will not bethe fishermen of the Maritime Provinces, of
the St. Lawrence river and of the Pacifie
coast will be able to say, "Ready, aye ready."
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I have been
very much interested in listening to my
honourable friend's very informative speech,
but I must confess I was disappointed with
regard to its termination. He said at the
beginning that Canada was unable to protect
lier 7,000 miles of coast-line. He drew attention to the fact thuat we have only four
destroyers. The largest guns on those destroyers are 4-7. Now, Canada undertook some
years ago to defend ber own coast-line and to
protect lier sea routes. I should like to ask
the honourable gentleman what he suggests
should be done at the present time with regard
to increasing our naval forces. He possesses
a great deal of information and is aware of
the critical position in which Canada stands.
Is lie in favour of more light cruisers? Is he
in favour of having the Naval College
reopened? I agree with what lie says about
the training of certain ratings on fishing boats,
but, as I pointed out in my first speech in
this debate, men who desire to become officers
have. to go through a highly technical course
of training. That can be obtained only at a
naval college in this country or in England.
Within a few weeks the Prime Minister and
his colleagues will be attending the Imperial
'Conference, and one of the most important
questions on the agenda will be the defence
of the Empire.
I should like the honourable gentleman to
tell this House what he thinks Canada should
do in order to provide adequate protection
for her own coasts. Will he tell us the types
of ships, and how many of them, we ought
to have? Does lie not think that we ought
to proceed towards getting them at once,
instead of continuing to depend upon the
British Government?
And I should like
particularly to hear my honourable friends
opinion about the advisability of reopening
the Naval College.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I am sure, honourable
senators, that I appreciate the compliment
which my honourable friend, a former Minister
of Naval Affairs, has paid to the only admiral
of the fleet. Perhaps it would not be quite
fair for me, a layman and an ordinary business
man, one who has no governmental responsibilities, to express an opinion as to what should
be done. Yet it may be all right for me to
make a suggestion.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Certainly.

Hon. Mr. DUEF: 0f course, anything I may
say will nlot commit the Government, because
I ar n ot in its confidence. I can express
nothing but my own view. I agree with my
honourable friend fromn Alma (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne) that our prtesent protection is
absolutely inadequate.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:- Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DUJFF: Some flfteen years or so
ago, when my honourable friend and I bad a
gentlemanly argument, I felt we did not need
any naval reserve nor boats. I believed at
that time that there would be no further
necessity to provide against a war. But to-day
I agree with my honourable friend that we
should do something. I repeat that our
present protection is absolutely inadequate.
I arn told that our two cruisers are very fine
ships, as are our four mine sweepers. But
just think of four mine sweepers for 7,000
miles of coast on the Atlantic and 3,000 miles
on the Pacifie! I arn not cri ticizing the
Government. I arn simply saying that the
thing is ridiculous. We must go further and
do something in order to convince the Government that it should provide more protection.
After aIl, the Government is only tbe
executive.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTY NE: Wbat do you
recommend?
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I should not like to
recomrnend anytbing.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: What do you
suggest, then?
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Nor should I like to
suggest anything. But I do say to ýmy honcurable friend that we sbould go .iust as far as
it is possible for us to, go. It is useless te
stop with f'our destroyers-two on each coast.
If we provide no more protection than that,
we bave to depend on the Monroe Doctrine.
I do noît want Canada te do that; I wasat it
to býe independeut. I want it to be able Vo
say ýt the unit-ed States, "Wkile we are very
friefndly withi yo'u, we will bea.r cuir own
buirdene to the best of cu-r ability."
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: What about
the Naval College? Do you agree that should
be reopened?
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Well, my honourable
friend will admit that from the time we
were boys, he and 1, we neyer wore a white
collar until we got inito, the Senate. Whiile I
amn in favour of training schools, both on the
Pacifie and the Atlantic, I amn rather afraid cf
a naval college. I think we should bave a
training ship on the Atlantic and one on the
Pacifie, and that some further training should

also be provided on cruisers. In addition
there should he a training depot on shore
for the teaching of things that cannot be
taught at sea. 1 arn willing te go as far as
the people of this country want us to go. I
have entirely changed my view with regard
to what we should do- in the matter of naval
defence, hecause conditions are different from
what they were. It would be presumption on
my part to suggest anything to the G-overnment, but if the Government should wish
to consuit my honourable friend from Aima
and myself-and I do not know from whom
they could get better advice-I certainly
should ýbe willing to express my opinion.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: What do you
say with regard to Lord Jellicoe's suggestion?
Hon. Mr. DUFF:

That wvas made

some

Hon. Mr. PARENT: Why does the honourable gentleman from Aima (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne) nlot ask for endorsement of 14inch or 16-inch guns?
Hon. Mr. DUFF: My friend and I are just
having a friendly discussion. I arn willing
to go as far as po.ssible in doing anything I
can. If my advice is worth anything the
Government is welcome to it. and can have
it without a cent of cost. It would not be
fair for me to suggest here, thoiigh. that the
Govternment should buy -a certain number of
ships. I do say that by doing what the
people want to have done. and by building up
the fishing industry as I suggested a few
moments ago, the Canadian nation within a
few years, and probably before war strikes
again-if it ever does-w ould be able to hold
up its head, independent of the Monroe
doctrine and ail other outside help.
Hon. J. P. B. CASCRAIN: Honourable
senators, I do not want to take any long
part in this discussion. The honourable senater fromn Aima (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) says
that while the Naval College at Halifax is
closed it is necessary to send naval cadets to
training colleges in England. I arn sorry to
disagree with him on that point. I have
agreed with some things he has done. For
instance, I agree with bis Canadian navy.
There were few in our party who did. and I
was one of them.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I know that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAIND:) A friend in need.
Hon. Mr. ýCASGRAIN: The honourable
senator fromn Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duif) has
given us a great deal of information. I do
noV think I have heard a better speech ini the
Senate for many years than the one ha has

MARCH 31, 1937
just delivered. lIt was a magnificent speech.
What bie says is absolutely correct.
As to scientifica]ly and technically trained
oifficers, to whom the honourable senator from
Aima has referred, it must be remembered
that for every one of ýthese it is necessary
to have fifty or one hundred seamen.
It would be the easiest thing in the world
to establish a naval branch at the Royal
Military ýCollege in Kingston. Ever since the
time of the Mackenzie Government that institution bas been turning out men who
have become this country's pride. Sir Charles
Tupper complimented me on some relatives
of mine who had been trained there and
distinguished tbemselves in the Imperial services. These young men who go through the
Royal Military College are qualified as civil
engineers. land surveyors, and so on. Tbey
have to be much more precise in some of
their work than naval officers are required ta
be. For instance, a land surveyor bas to
measure to an exact point on the ground, but
if a naval officer can see the shore hie can
direct bis ship witbout having to take observations on the sun or to look at bis chronometer.
My bonourable friend fromn Lunenburg bas
made some suggestions. I should like to add
this one: that a naval branch be added to the
Royal Military College at Kingston. Tbat
could be done witbout the expenditure of any
money.
Young men who graduate from. Kingston
are, or used to be, sele.cted for four commissions in the Britisb service: in the Royal
Engineers, in tbe cavalry, in the artillery and
in the infantry. I am glad to say tbat seimeone I knew weIl was recommended for selctien years ago, througb Sir John A. Macdonald, and bie acquired a great deal of distinction in the service of England and of the
Empire.
It would be a fine thing if we could arrange
some plan for encouraging the fisbing industry
and at the samne time helping to build up a
naval reserve, as suggested by the honourable senator fromn Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duif)
The fishermen are able sailors, and no better
men could be obtained for the navy. But
I must say I was surprised to hear the
honourable senator say that France pays a
subsidy of $2 per quintal of fish caugbt by
its fishermen. For haîf th-at cost you can
buy a quintal of fisb anywbere along the
Gaspé coast. So France should buy it there
and save a dollar on every quintal. But I
suppose she knows hier business.
The men wbo come te St. Pierre and
Miquelon are wonderful sailors. With the navy
higbly mechanized as iA is to-day, you must
have scienitifie men~ in the seqwjioe, so the
31117-17J

259

sbips will not be run ashore-as was done
in the Bay of Chaleur by a certain gentleman
wbo at one time was bead of our Naval
Service here. We sbould instruct a limited
number of men by putting them tbrough a
special course at Kingston. This would necessitate a small addition to the staff, a professor
or two, but the expense would not be great,
for, as we know, professors are not paid very
high salaries. I agree with the honourable
gentleman fromn Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duif)
that you need sailors to man these ships. You
could get any number of able seamen from
Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswickthe finest sailors in the world.
We ail remember the days when the ships
of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick were
noted on the seven seas. The Lightning, a
celebrated clipper ship, was built by theMcKays. She and the Thunderer and theCutty Sark were wonderfully spe-edy, a.nd sailed
between England and Australiàa. The Lightning made the trip in seventy-eight days. A.
tramp steamer to-day could not do much
better. When I told the story in this House
honourable members tbought that perhaps I
was exaggerating, but the late Senator Roche
said thýat he remembered the ship very well,
for when hie was a lad bis father took him
by the band to inspect bier. When the ship
was finisbed in Nova Scotia she was taken
over to England and about $10,000 was spent
in decorating the dining-room. That ship was
less than 3,000 tons, about the tonnage of one
of our canal boats, yet she carrîed to Australia
five hundred passengers and freight. How it
was donc is still a mystery to me.
Those fine old sailing ships have disappeared.
It may seem strange to some honourable
members that noted marine archi-tects of England and Scotland are of opinion that the
future freigbters will be large sailing sbips
with fore and af t rig, whicb means six or
seven masts, and sails from the boom to the
ýtruck, of eigb>ty feet, aIl operated by elecotric
wincbes, with small motive power, so that if
the sbîip is beoelmed and -the mn i tihe
crow's nest sees a little breeze stirring the
ocean a few miles away, the ship can be propelled slowly to that point. When we do
come back to sailing sbips I know of no better
place than New Brunswick and Nova Scotia
and Quebec along the Gulf to supply the
fnest seamen in the world.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STATINTON: May 1
ask tbe honourable senator from Alma whetber,
in order to give the necessary training to
those wbo desire to become naval officers, it
would not be far better to send thein to
English naval scbools rather than reopen aur
Naval College?

SENATE

260

~Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: There is no
reason why that should not be done, but when
the Naval Act was placed on the Statute
Book in 1910 the Naval College was open and
.so many cadets a year were taken into the
British Navy.

On the two occasions

when

I

visited the Admiralty they complimented Canada very highly on our Naval College and on
the efficiency and alertness of our cadets.
Therefore in my opinion it would be better
to reopen the Naval College.

APRIL 1, 1937
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, there is one point which seems to
me to deserve a little consideration. Perhaps
it had attention at the hands of the conmittee. Under our Patent Act patents have
a limited life, after which they become the
property of the public, with right to their
use. and so on. Does it seem quite right
that this exclusive privilege should be permanent? If this right is granted it will
prevail over the whole world, and therefore
ought to be in conformity with the comity
of nations on the subject of trade-marks.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Under the provincial Guardianship Act the guardianship is
to be maintained only until the quintuplets
are eighteen years of age.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The .powers
of the board as guardians would then cease,
but what would become of the rights granted?
Does the Bill state that those rights lapse
with the guardianship?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: If the guardianship disappeared, would not the rights
given to that guardianship disappear as well?

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

probably they will, means will

I venture
of value,

the sake

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Of course, it
would be necessary to amend the provincial
statute in that respect. I imagine that would
be a very grave step to take. I should think
that under present conditions the protection
would not continue longer than the guardianship, and if that guardianship were extended
it would be with the full knowledge that it
included rights granted under this Bill. This
is a peculiar situation: there is no competition in this line in any country in the world,
and there is not likely to be. However, if
competition did occur and I happened to be
in the House at the time, I should not be
averse, as sponsor of this Bill, to our making
it not applicable to any real competitors.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Honourable senators,
I think the preamble of the Bill may throw
a little light on this question, because it recites that the Board of Guardians has been
appointed by the Ontario Legislature and
that certain rights are vested in that board.
When the time comes for that Board of
Guardians to be demobilized, or when its
time expires upon the children reaching
eighteen years of age, I should say all rights
then held by the guardians expire.

261

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Ontario Legislature, which is the proper jurisdiction in respect of civil rights, says that all
rights that appertain to these children become the rights of the guardians until the
children are eighteen, at which time the
rights revert to the children and whatever
assets have been accumulated are theirs.
Now, by this Bill, we create another right and
vest it in the guardians. My apprehension
is that when the other rights revert to the
children the right we are granting under this
statute will remain with the guardians, because this statute is permanent; and I question whether our legislation is in conformity
with the spirit of the trade-mark convention.
It was my intention to attend the meeting
of the committee and see that this matter was
looked into, but I overlooked doing so.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third, time, and passed.

a certain priority as against certain unsecured
obligations of the railway, and must therefore
be preserved as a protection to the Government. For this purpose, a Securities Trust is
established by the Bill to hold all claims of the
Government against the railway. Shares of
the Securities Trust will be wholly held by
the Minister of Finance, and will be given a
stated value equal to that part of the securities, held by the Trust, which represents investment in the railway property. The
stated value of the shares will be shown in the
railway balance sheet as part of the proprietor's
equity. The purpose of forming a corporation
to hold these shares is to permit the consolidation of their stated value in the railway
balance sheet.
The Bill also provides for a consolidation
of the component parts of the railway in one
corporation. At present Canadian National
Railways include the Grand Trunk Railway,
with some sixty subsidiary companies. On
the other hand, the Canadian Northern Railway, with some forty subsidiary companies,
has a separate corporate identity. The stock
of both railways is held by the Minister
of Finance, and both railways have a
common board of directors. Similarly, the
Intercolonial and Canadian Government Railways are owned outright by the Dominion of
Canada, and are entrusted te Canadian National Railways for management.
Unification of these three separate identities
in a single corporate structure will facilitate
reduction of the number of subsidiary companies and thus simplify the accounting.
I have stated that the need for a revision
of the accounts of the Canadian National
Railways had been emphasized by the first
chairman, Sir Joseph Flavelle, as well as the
chartered accountants who reported on the
subject in 1925; likewise by the Duff Commission in 1931, and the auditors of the railway on several occasions. It is significant
-that every one who has had to do with the
Canadian National Railways has urged the
necessity for the procedure which is being followed in this Bill. We have first the DraytonAcworth Commission of 1917. Then we have
the two firms of chartered accountants who
were appointed by the Government to make
a report on the accounts as between the Government and the National Railway. Those
accountants recommended the step which is
now being taken. They are Edwards, Morgan
and Company, and Peat, Marwick, Mitchell
and Company. They recommended that the
Government advances for deficits be net added
to the investment account, but be absorbed
in the consolidated revenue fund of Canada.

263

I am quoting now from the memorandum
read by the Hon. Minister of Transport in
the other House:
Then we have the report of the Duff com-

mission of 1931-32 under the chairmanship of
the Right Hon. Sir Lyman P. Duff, which made
two significant statenients on the writing down
of the capital liabilities of the Canadian National Railways. In considering the earning

power of the railway the commission said, at
page 30:

"It is obvious that on this basis of earnings

the capital liabilities would require
drastic writing down."

a very

In recommending the early attention of the

board of trustees to the whole matter of the

capital structure the commission further emphasized the need of liability adjustment as follows:
"This commission is of the opinion that it

must be frankly recognized that a very sub-

stantial part of the money invested in the railways comprised within the Canadian National
system must be regarded as lost and that its

capital liabilities should be heavily written
down."
Then we have the Canadian National-Canadian Pacific Act of 1933, passed by the late
Government, which provided that "income deficits shall net be funded."
We have the

financial legislation since 1932 which specifically

limits the borrowing powers of the railway te
capital expenditures and refunding, and which
specifically declares that deficit appropriations
should be applied against the accountable advances. Then we have a very interesting letter
from which I think I might take time te read
a few lines, addressed te Right Hon. Arthur
Meighen, then Prime Minister of Canada, by
Sir Joseph Flavelle, Bart., dated Toronto,
August 12, 1921. At the time Sir Joseph was
chairman of the board of the Canadian National
Railways. He pointed out his idea of the proper
capital structure for the railway. On page 7
the letter says:
"The new National Railway Company te be
formed shall have a nominal capital of say
five million common shares and two million five

hundred thousand
shares."

six per

cent

preference

The total share capital would thus be $750,000,000, with the Government taking common
shares at par in payment of its existing advances te the various systems. These, as of
December 31. 1920, were $320,000,000 of loans
and $33,000,000 of Grand Trunk Pacific de-

bentures.

"The figure would no doubt be increased by
December 30 next, or whatever date was fixed
for taking over. The Government would turn
over te the company the equity in the system"There you will observe the Securities Trust.
-"subject only te the bonds and debentures
and guaranteed stock issued te the public, and
te the fixed charges which may result from the
Grand Trunk arbitration."
In other words, the debt of the railway was
te be made a closed book. and advances from
the Government were te be covered by common stock. The paragraph continues:
"Thus, the existing Government advances, excluding the capital cost of the Intercolonial
and Transcontinental. were te be represented
by common stock ownership only, and no part
of the interest on it would be a fixed charge
or would be cumulative."

264

SENATE

Then we have the precedent of the accounting practice of the state-ownced railways of
Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. In
connection with the Victorian railways, legislatien passed December last provides for writing
down of the railway loan liability by £30,000,000 sterling. It is a forty per cent writedown, which is very heavy depreciation. The
interest on this capital write-down will no
longer appear as a charge in the railway accounts.
There is no accumulation of prior
years' deficits in the 1936 balance sheet.
In the annual report of the South Australian railways for the year ended June 30, 1935,
the commissioner suggests a capital write-down
of £10.800,000 sterling and the elimination of
interest on that sum. Deficits accumulated up
to 1927 were written off by parliamentary
authority in that year.
The 1936 balance sheet of the Western Anstralian railways shows no accumulation of prior
years' deficits. The Queensland Railways had
a capital write-down of £28.000,000 sterling
under parliamentary authority in 1931.
The
interest on this capital write-down no longer
appears in the railway accounts. There is no
accumulation of prier years' deficits on the 1936
balance sheet.
The New Zealand Railways
had a capital write-down of £10,400.000 sterling
under parliamentary authority in 1931.
The
interest on tbis capital write-down no longer
appears in the railways' accounts. There is no
accumulation of prior years' deficits on the
1936 balance sheet.
We are
Now as te the Securities Trust.
eliminating from the present indebtedness of

the railway several items wbich I think we
all agree should properly be eliminated. One
item is some $373,000,000 of accumulated deficits: another amonnts to some $530.000.000
of interest.
We have claims here totalling
about $1,100.000.000, of which only $270.000.000
was actually invested in the railway property.
That $1,100,000.000 bas a value in that it establishes certain priorities in connection witlh any
claims against the railway property made by
anyone other than the Dominion Government,
and for that reason we have thought it worth
while to preserve those claims.
Nevertheless
we do not wish to burden our balance sheet
with more than the amoont of those claims
representing the actual investment in the
property. Therefore, as a matter of convenience
only, we have set up a company to be known
as the Securities Trust. which will hold al] the
claims. totalling sonething over a billion dollars.
But we shall put a value on the Securities

Trust representing the $270.000.000 so invested

in the property, and that amount we wish to
include in the balance sheet of our railway
as part of the proprietor's equity. Therefore
we set up this company in a forin wbich will
permit it to be consolidated in the balance
sheet of the railway. and we make the provisien that this Securities Trust is a company
within Canadian National Railways.
On the other hand, we place the stock and
ownership of the company in the hands of the
Minister of Finance. in lieu of the claims he
formerly held, totalling over a billion dollars.
We then say that we shall issue five million
shares of stock representing ownership of the
Securities Trust. After all. five million sbares
does net seem to be out of line with claims
having a face value of over $1.100.000.000.
So
tiere we have our Securities Trust, a company
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

wholly owned by the Minister of Finance, a
company within the Canadian National Railways in order that its stated value may be
consolidated with the railway balance sheet.
The question arises what the net benefit cf
all this may be. It seems to me that it can
be put concretely in a few words. In the first
place we put a value on the property, the
Canadian National Railways, which represents
the total money invested in that property.
Surely that presents a fairer picture to the
public and the world at large than the present
structure, enlarged as it is by operating deficits
and interest thereon.
It seens to mse it is
going to give the officers and employees of the
railways a more reasonable objective to attain.
Surely the earning power of a property niust
bear somie proportion to the investient in thiat
And setting up as the capital the
property.
investment in the property rather tlan a laige
inflated sum wil, I believe, put new hope in
those responsible for the operation of the
property.
It also shows to the world a consolidated
balance sheet of Canada and its whollyu oed
subsidiary which will give a real picture of
the total indebtedness of the tw o. Witlh this
balance sheet we cean say to the investor in the
securities of Canada: "We have a certain debt
which is shown in the net debt of Canada. We
are responsible for a certain other debt. the
funded debt of the Canadian National Railwas,
as shown in lier balance sheet. If you add one
debt to the other you have the total indebtedness of Canada. and when you buy a security
of either the Goverenient of Canada or the
Canadian National Railways you are by iing
your proportion of that consolidated debt."
When that picture is shown, I believe we shall

be better able to say to the investor of Canada:
"If you buy a bond of the Dominion of Cainada
or a bond of its principal subsidiary, the Canadian

National

Railwaays.

you

will

be

buying

an obligation of the Dominion which, when due,
will be met in full in the future just as it lhas
been in the past."
Now, there is a warningalwhich has gradually invaded and possessed my mind in connection with the many criticisms I have heard
about this resetting of our financial situation.
It is that some people in Canada who, from
tradition, are opposed to State ownership. are

fearful that we may show our assets in the
Canadian National Railways in such a ight
as to give hope of securing some advantage
not only for the country. but also for the
Canadian National Railways. I have heard
criticisms indicating a fear that even the
slightest touching of the accumulated debts
crowding upon the Canadian National Railavays might lead the public at large to believe

that better days were in prospect for those
railways. This asset is our property. I believe
that this vast investment by the ratepayers
of Canada should be treated fairly, and I am
convinced that the amount of money, about
$1,100.000,000, which would go into the trust
represents what might fairly be called a shareholders' equity in the institution. I feel that
it is a shareholders' equity in the operations

APRIL 1, 1937
of the systern. We must nlot forget that we
are ail shareholders in that system; that the
money came from us; that it bas been lost
in the operations of the railway and that we,
although carrying our load and repudiating
none of our obligations as sbareholders of
Canada, sbould accept tbat as a national comnmon stock equity.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Does tbe
bonourable gentleman mean tbat Canada has
an equity in the Canadian National above
its indebtedness of a billion and a baîf?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No. 1 say tbat
the amount we set down as practically lestadvances to meet deficits and interest upon
deficits-is set aside in tbe equity trust
simply to maintain our right of priorityHon. M.r. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I understand that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
-and to present, for whatever it is worth, a clear statement of what we have advanced in the years
of depression up to date; that it will stand
there for the purpose of giving a clear knowledge of the efforts made by Canada in railway building.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: May I ask a question?
Aside from the $227,000,000 to which the hionourable gentleman referred in the early part
of bis remarksHon. Mr. DANDURAND: $270,000,000.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I think there were some
deductions. But aside from that, which is
prohably not a debt properly chargeable to
the Canadian National Railways, are not
tbese other two groups of figures--the o>ne
it is proposed to put into this trust and the
one it is meant to retain as part of the railway-tbe debt of the railways of Canada to
the people of Canada? Tbe m-oney was actually put in, was it not? It was expended
by the people of Canada?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes. The money
was expended by the people of Canada, and
they are supposed to have a dlaim, against
themselves as the owners of the Canadian
National Railways. Whatever dead wood
remains is kept because the people of Canada
are tbe sbareholders in the company, and
because any otber dlaims that might be presented are secondary to tbose advances. Tbis
dlaim represents to the shareholders of the
company-my honourable friend and myself
-a common stock equity.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: It represents, if I
und-erstand it, suiuething over $3,000,000,000 of
actual money expended by the people of

265

Canada. What I want-for I must have
some justification for supporting the Bill, if
I do support it-is an explanation as to why,
if we bave over $3,000,000,000 in this railway
we do flot show it. Why divide it up? 1
bave net seen any explanation or any definite
reason sbowing wby we should split this
debt wbich the people of Canada owe to
themnselves-if you wish to put it that wayand wby we sbould try te allocate one part
to the trust company and another part to
the publie accounts. It seems to me that
we might as well keep it ail in one acceunt.
I have flot yet beard a satisfactory explanation for the subdivision of these figures.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Possibly I hav e
not made myself clear, but I have been
supported in my argument by ahl the authorities, fruin Sir Joseph Flavelle down tu
those of the present day, who have had anvthing te do with tbe Canadian National Railways. They bave said it was unfair to have
what is apparently a separate entity carry
an expenditure which has not brought any
increase to the capital, but has been simply
the payment of deficits and the accumulated
interest upon tbem.
1 may say to my honourable friend that
when the Bihl came from the Commons the
other day I said that I would flot ask the
Senate of Canada to accept the underlying
principle, but would simply ask that we give
the Bill second reading and send it te ceinmittee, where the matter could be thoroughlv
sifted, and when the committea reported
honourable gentlemen could express their
opinions and challenge the report if they s0
desired.
Rigbt Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, when this Bill was up two
days ago 1 confessed my despair after a vigorous effort to understand its purport and
full effeet. Even now, ýafter the speech of the
leader of the Government and after as many
bours of concentrated effort upon it as I
could give, I am net at aIl hopeful of making
the full import of the measure clear to the
House, the reason being that it is net clear
te me. However, I have gone far enough te,
think I understand quite a littie bit about
it, and I will ask tbe House to bear with
mýe while 1 attempt, as briefly as possible, to
make clear wbat I do know of the measure.
It is almost impossible to overestimate the
real significance of this legislation. It appears
in a very engaging habit. One would think
that it did not make much difference where
we put the acceunt of the Canadian National
Railways; that by altering the balance sheet
and writing down, as we are in tbe habit of

de.scribing the operation, we do flot take away
a nickel fromn the organization and do flot add
a nickel to it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Ilear. bear.

Hight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Becauie of
apparent futility one is liable to think the
Bill does flot mean a great deal; but after
sonie ,tudy 1 arn convinced that it has very
great significance.
I shahl be pardoned, I trust, if I say a word
as an aside. I do flot believe any human
being can gain any acclaim. much less popularity, by criticizing the measure. I do not
think anybody is going to criticize it unless
he tbinks it is bis bounden duty to do so.
Certainly among the employees of the Canadian National he will get no favour. I do
flot (loubt that every one of them, from the
huniblest workman to the most highly paid
ofliiial-and some of tbcem are pretty bigbly
paqd-s in favour of it and will raise both
hands. and cheer for it.
Hon. 'Mr. DLTFF: Tbey will want another
ten per cent next year.
Riglit HUon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
If you can
make the balance appear favourable you will
tit ruhv gain, for the comp'any a certain
meaisure of kind remarks on the part of the
press. and members of Parliament wben tbe
affairs of the railway are under review, and
will mauke more easy the way of those in
its employ.
W/bat the Minister says we are doing, if I
understand birn correctly, is this-and "it is
truc that. first of ahl, we are trying to eliminate duplication. At present, be says, and
trutbfully, there appears in our public accounts
a tlebt amounting to a billion dollars incurred
by our advancing money to tbe ýCanadian
National Railways or its subsidiaries, and
riaturally tbis appears also as a debt of tbe
railway. because the railway owes the money
to us. 'My bonourable friend's contention is,
I gather. that a casual observer. looking at the
elebt of the Canadian National Railways and
the debt of the Government of Canada,'would
tbink we owed $2.000,000,000 instead of
$1,000,000.000. But, I pause to ask, wbat is the
purpose of the balance sheet of a company?
Will any purpose be served by baving a
balance ,heet sbow less than the amount the
company actually owes, less than the amount
that actuall 'y went into tbe company?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Oh, no.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
But the
lionourable member will sce that tbat is what
is heing, done.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Not less money
than went into it.
Rilt

1-on.

Mr.

MEIGHEN.

Rilit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN-,: Tjnquestionably.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Every dollar
that went into it will be shown. It is tbe
deficits and tbe interest thereon, whicb did
îlot go into tbe company, that will not appear.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: To an extent
,tbe honourable gentleman is correct, but not
altogether so, and in principle he is entirely
wrong. W/bat I amn dealing withi now is the
wisdom of this desire of the Government as
respects duplication. Will any purpose really
be served by doing what tbe Government
wants to do?
Suppose it is true tbat tbe
National Railway's debt sbows money which
is shown also in the Dominion Governmenta
debt-money the Government had to borrow
in order to lend it to tbe railway, and on
whicb the Government has to pay interest.
W/bat is to be served by striking that sumn
ont of tbe National Railway's dýebt? There
may be some people ignorant enough to think,
because the amount is shown. among tbe liabilities botbi of tbe railway and of the Governmont, tbat tvice as mucb is owed, but sucbi
people are not among those who underwrite
Dominion Governinent bonds and Canadian
National Railways bonds. The underwriters
know perfectly well the exact amounit owed
by tbe Government and by the railway, and
how mnuch of the debt of eacb is duplication.
One can imagine a financial bouse in New
Yor-li: or a series of financial bouses in Canada. wbicb bave had to do witb tbe history
of these obligations for decades and know
exactly where we stand. It is tbese people
who matter, for it is; from tbem we borrow.
They are ocr money market. Therefore, I
do0 not tbink tbere is anytbing wbatever in
tbe duplication argument.
But I do not mean that tbere sbould not
be some amendment to tbe balance sbeet of
tbe Canadiýan National. Tbe purpose of a
balance shcet is to refiect tbe exact truth.
To the extent tbat it departs from tbe exact
trutb or ducs not reflect the substauýtial facts
of tbe situation, it fails to serve the purpose
of a balance sbeet. I do not tbink tbe balanc
sbeet of to-day does refleet the exact trutb.
I understand that wben tbe Grand Trunk was
taken over we acquired three series of preference stocks and tbe common stock, and
tbat tbese stocks stood on tbe books of the
company at tbeir par values and we incorporated tbem in tbe books of tbe new company at the same values. The arbitrators
found tbey were worth nothing, and there is
no doubt tbat tbey are wortb notbing. It does
not seem to be a reflection of tbe real situation to bave tbese stand on the liability side,
representing capital liability, at any sncb

APRIL 1, 1937
fictitious values. Consequently it is only right
that there should be a write-down. Those
figures do not represent money put into the
system; they merely represent certain stocks
taken over on the books of the system in 1920.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: How were
those liabilities?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They were
not liabilities. The capital liabilities of a
company, common stock and bonds, all appear
on the liability side.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: All that
are held outside of the company.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: But these
are not held outside of the company.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They are held
by the Government of Canada.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: As distinct from the corporation.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The corporation does not hold its common stock.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is held by the
Minister of Finance.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Speaking subjeet to correction that may be necessary after
further inquiry, I think a case can be made
out for writing down in respect of that character of capital asset or capital liability, as it
appears in the balance sheet. Now, the Minister seeks to fortify his positionHon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will my right
honourable friend permit me? He has not
spoken of the Canadian Northern. He has
referred to the Grand Trunk stock liability
only. Does he not apply the same argument
to the Canadian Norbhern?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If there is a
similar case in respect of the Canadian Northern I should be quite prepared to have similar
adjustments.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: What is
the liability of the Canadian National on any
stock held by the Government? What is the
monetary liability?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is
none.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: That is
the reason I cannot understand how it is a
liability.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yet it appears
in the liability column.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: But it is
not a liability.

267

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is not a
liability in the sense of a debt.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Would the
right honourable gentleman permit me to ask
him a question?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Certainly.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Does he not
think that the appearance of the liability for
the Grand Trunk stock encouraged certain
holders of that stock to enter an action against
the company?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have always wondered what in the world did en.
courage them to enter an action. That ex.
planation is as good as any.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: We admitted it
as a liability in our own statement.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have always thought-it is more tihan a thought, because it is part of history-that that action
was about as outstanding an example of poor
sportsmanship as I have ever witnessed in my
life. Those people came to us and on their
knees told us they could not carry on, as
they were at the end of their tether, and
pleaded with us to take over the road. We
made a proposal which, after months, they
turned down. An alternative proposal, for
arbitration, which we made at the same time,
was accepted after some months. Its acceptance was recorded by vote of their directors
and acquiesced in by their shareholders. They
had as much to say in the choice of arbitrators and in the termas of the arbitration as we
had, but after they lost they whined all over
England that this stock was stolen from them
by the Government, and finally they started
an action. They wrote me about it, but they
never published the reply that I sent them.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I am not surprised at that. I just wanted to suggest that
the fact of our carrying that amount in our
own balance sheet as a liability would be an
argument in convincing some of the shareholders, at least, that we admitted it was a
real liability and that they had good ground
for action.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is possible,
but I think those people were really better
informed than that. I think they simply engaged in a little semi-blackmailing sport,
trying to make a nuisance value. I do not
think they had anything else in their minds.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I had some experience with them.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And probably
some of their number were engaged in the
joyful occupation of making positions for
themselves at the expense of the others.

268

SENATE

Now I corne to the arguments of the Minister of Finance for the proposai. He says,
first, that everyone who has had anything to
do with the railway, as president or auditor or
investigator, bas recommended that this revision be made. That is going too far. There
is no recommendation on the part of any
single one of them that this be done. It has
been recommended that there be a writing
down. that a real effort be made to remodel
the balance sheet so as to reflect more faithfully the actual position of the company. Sir
Joseph Flavelle wrote me in August, 1921.
It may be that I was net as impressed with
his appeal as I should have been. I should
perhaps have realized that he knew more
about those things than I did. But at that
time I could not see any practical object to
be served by what was proposed. And Sir
Joseph Flavelle's views., too, matured later
on. He was one of the main members of the
Duff-Flavelle Commission of 1931, which made
a recommendation. I have so much respect
for that commission and so high an appreciation of the thoroughness with which its
members studied the whole position that I
should be disposei to accept tiat reconnendation to its full extent. I should not like
to take the responsibility of placing my judgment against that arrived at by men of such
calibre after the study they made.
But I know this Bill goes a great deal farther
than

any

recomendation

made

by

Sir

Jospeh Flavelle in 1921 or by the DuffFlavelle Commission in 1932. What is proposed here may be recommended by accountants, but that does not weigh in my mind at
ail. If this proposal were adopted the situation would then probably be simpler from
tie accounrtants' standpoint; but we must
judge the situation from the standpoint net
of accountants, but of Canadian taxpayers,
and from the standpoint of taxpayers one
thing is definitely demanded: that the balance
sheet show the real situation, reveal ail the
money which bas been put into the railway
and romains owing to the country. If something was contributei in any other form than
money, it should bc shown at its real, not a
fictitious value. That is the only form of
remodelling which I think should be adopted.
For yecars the raihsay had deficits.
In
reality it has never had anytlhing else. Those
were sometimes met by treasury moneys
handed over, se far as they were cas deficits.
At other times they were funded by the railway in the form of bonds. The amount of
deficits is fairly known. an-d up to 1927. I
think, all those deficits appeared in tho railway's books. Then, for sone cause of which
I am not aware. what is described a- deficit
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN,

on tise eastern lines ceased to be ise-rted at
aIl. It seemed to be regarded as in tie same
position as the 20 per cent which tise Govcrnment paid because of tise Duncan award.
Since 1933, I understand, no deficits at all
have appeared, even bthough the mnoney was
supplied. This Bill does not proviie for the
appearance of those deficits; on the contrary.
it provides that never more shall they bc
shown. Why is that? The anounts represent real money which the railway owens. Perhaps tiey should not be funded. I unsiorstand
the Duff Commission recommended thant they
should not be funded and interest shoul not
be chargedi upon thom. Very well. but why
should they net be shown?
The countrry has advancei capital to the
raihway in tremendous amounts. Tie actual
capital advance. I think. is the anouînt which
is intended to be w rappd into heise sweepings and held by "The Canadian National
Railways Securities Trust" at $690.000,000. Ons
that capital tie railway 'has always ow l
iis
interest, the accumulated amount of which
now aggregates about $495.000.000. We havi
to pay intir.est on the money. This sun of
$690,000.000 is now to go into tihe Seuriies
Trust in this way. The Minister of Finance
sits in possession of ie
lenand notes snd
other forms of obligation of the Canudian
National Railways and its subsidiari s. Tie
whole list of these obligations is ziven in
appendices attachied to tie Bil. Ths Mini-ter
is in possession of them as trustee for tie

held in tihe namse of this Socurities Trust.
Honourable senators will realizo at once
that that Securities Trust will be a whollvowned subsidiary of the Dominion of Canada
Likewise the Canadian National is a viollvowned subsidiary, subject to its indebteinoss.
Whv is this Securities Trust to be created?
The honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) says it is to be created in order that
the Government may hold its priorities in
respect of tihose obligations wbici are now in
the namie of the Minister of Finance and are
the prop-erty of the Dominion. The Minister
wants to hold the priorities and at the same
time to reduce the capital; so he will put tie
obligations in the nane of the Securities
Trust at reduced values. and these lower
figures will appear in tie balance sbee.

APRIL, 1, 1937
Section 22 of the Bill says this Securities
Trust shall be one of the companies comprised in the National Railways System. This
means that the accounts of the trust will be
consoiidated with those of the railway. Here
are two subsidiaries of the Dominion of Canada: one, the Securities Trust; the other, the
Canadian National Raiiways. The accounts
of these two subsidiaries are to be consolidated. Who ever heard of a thing like that?
Lt is ail right to consolidate accounts of one
subsidiary or a dozen subsidiaries of a parent
company. but the proposai here is to consolidate aceounts of two subsidiaries of the
Government of Canada, neither of which owns
aux' of the other's assets. Do honourabie
members know why these accounts are to be
consoiidated? The reason is that this is the
only way in which the amount can be wiped
out. The priorities would be retained just the
sarne if tue obligations were held in the name
of the Minister.
My right honHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ourable friend wiil agree that the amount of
money advan-ced for deficits, plus the pyra.
rnided interest, amounting in ail to between
seven and eight hundred million dollars, should
not be a burden of debt upon the Canadian
National.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN:
agree to that at ail.

I do not

I think rnost
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
of the authorities I have cited agree that
deficits which are met by the Government,
together with accumulated interest, sbould not
appear as a debt of the Canadian National.
As it is important to have them remain as a
prior claim, they must appear somewhere.
That is why the Securities Trust has been
devised.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: What is to
be gained by relieving the Canadian National
Railways of an bonest debt for mo:ney which
it received?
The debtor
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
and the creditor are one and the same party.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHIN: There is the
kernel of the whole matter. That the debtor
and the creditor are one and the same party
is no reason for doing it at ail. We have
a suhsidiary, the Canadian National Railway
Company. We own ail its stock. It is important that the people of this country shouid
know just how that entity is getting on, and
thev wili neyer know if you provide that it.s
balance sheet shall not show debts because
those debts are already enormous. You are

269

simply providing in advance that the people
shahl not undcrstand the operation of the
National Railways from the balance sheet.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Does my right
bonourable friend really think this adjustment wiil prevent the people from knowing
how the National Railway System is operating?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: You do flot
add a cent to nor take a cent out of the
system's treasury, but you alter the appearance of its financial results, and you deai
with them in such a way as to fail to disclose
the facts. The money wcnt into the system.
What reason can be given for keeping that
obligation -out of the books of the Canadian
National Raiiway Company? Simply thýat, as
we have had to borrow the money, the
obligation appears in our books. The only
purpose of the Canadian National balance
sheet is to show the system's position on a
basis of reality. Wipe out any fictitious
values there, for they are not a fair, true
presentation, but do not wipe out real capital,
nor interest on it. You are wipîng out

adjustments become effective.
1 have a ver-v earnest intercst in this
whoie subject. I arn not going into 'the bistory of the systern, but honourabie members
on ail sides know there have been periods
of the grossest extravagance in management.
I know the systern was handicapped hy talcing over unnecessary roads, and I do flot intend to discuss responsibility for their acquisition. But we had several years of revehling
in railway operations, which resuited in an
addition te the system's debt at a rate averaging 3100,000,000 a year. Now, if you adjust the balance sheet so as not to disclose
the consequences of that debauch, you are
going to invite another period of extravagance.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: That is
right.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That will
be the tendency, no matter what Government
is in office. It is ail very well for people to
Say. "That money is gone. What is the use
of keeping it in the books?" I know it is
gone.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And will neyer

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It cannot
corne back. But I see value in keeping it
in thc books. I think a history should be a
history, a record should be a record. There

270

SENATE

should not be a distortion of the history, a
blotting out of the record, in order that we
may feel better and delude ourselves into
the belief that we are living in a paradise.
Such is apparently the effect of the Bill in
many of its features. J do not oppose the
measure; I think part of what is proposed
ought to be done; but I do not want the
Bill to go so far that it destroys the purpose of historical balance sheets, particularly
as I know it would invite a repetition of the
practices which in the main account for the
disastrous position disclosed by the balance
sheet to-day.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If no other
honourable senator desires to speak, I will

fears that if we reset-I apologize for using
the expression, because my right honourable
friend thought it was not quite good English
-he fears that if we reset the balance sheet
of the Canadian National and so give the
people of Canada a better impression of what
has really gone into the railway-

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Will the
honourable gentleman allow me? The present case is not at all the same as the one
he is setting up.
The receiver would recapitalize, and would start the bankrupt company on a new capital liability. This Bill is
not intended to deal with what took place
before we bought the various railways now
forming the National system. Its purpose is
to deal with and, it seems to me, conceal the
money we have put into the system since
we acquired it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My answer is
that instead of liquidating that situation we
took over the various railways. I know my
right honourable friend would tell me that
the reason why we did not allow those railways to go into the hands of a receiver was
that we were at war, and had we done so the
national credit would have been severely
shaken. That was the reason given to this
Chamber when we were confronted with the
necessity of voting for or against the purchase of the system.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Which system is the honourable gentleman speaking of?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
of the Grand Trunk.

I am speaking

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
A false
impression, the honourable gentleman means.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No; the War
had been over for years.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -they, through
their Government, may in the years to come
revel in a spending debauch. Well, my right
honourable friend knows that in the last fifty
years large and important railway systems
in the United States have fallen into the
hands of receivers. Those railway companies
were private corporations. And the component railway systems of the Canadian
National were private corporations before
we inherited them. Those bankrupt American railways were taken over, and the new
shareholders raised fresh capital and rehabilitated them. I wonder whether the original
shareholders or their children now feel very
much concerned over the difficult situation
which those railways encountered fifty years
ago.
Instead of allowing the Grand Trunk, the
Canadian Northern and the other railways
now consolidated in the National system to
go into liquidation, so that they might be
rehabilitated with new capital-

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, but we had
taken over the Canadian Northern.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Where would
the capital come from?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: You could always have found purchasers for those railways at a figure. Instead, we stepped in and
took them over.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It could not
have been operated if we had not taken it
over.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But we lent
$40000,000 to the Canadian Northern.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: That was before the War; in March, 1914.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But iwe were
then passing through a financial crisis. I need
not deal with that phase. I simply say that,
instead of allowing those railways to go into
bankruptcy, we stepped in, took the shares
and became owners. We have passed through
several difficult years. The administration
of the National Railways may have been
costly, but it has not been much more so
than the administration of the Canadian
Pacific.
Each system was extravagant in
fighting and trying to outrival the other. We
spent money largely to rehabilitate the Canadian National Railway System and put it on
a first-class footing.
We have had yearly
deficits running from $100,000,000 down to
$45,000,000 or $47,000,000. I think one year
the system met its operating expenses and
paid interest on the debt due the publie.

APRIL 1, 1937
The question now arises, what would be
the fair thing to do in setting up the capital
of the Canadian National Railways. My
right honourable friend says, "Yes, I admit it
should be overhauled, and some things should
disappear." I do not intend to enter into
details of what debts should be struck out.
I have suggested that we refer the Bill to
commiýttee and then discuss the situation so
that we may determine what is the fair
thing to do. We may not go the whole
length of the Bill. It would be for the Minister and his accountants to justify before
the committee the conclusions to which they
have come. As my right honourable friend
has said, there is not a cent to be gained by
the country. I repeat, we have to consider
what is the fair thing to do by the system,
which, after all, is the property of the people
of Canada.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I move that
this Bill be sent to the Standing Committee
on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours. It is
a railway Bill, though its aspect is financial.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think the
Committee on Banking and Commerce would
be more appropriate, but one committee is
just as good as the other in its personnel.
-Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should like to
have the opinion of honourable senators.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Surely the Bill
should go to the Railway Committee.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: All right; we
will say the Railway Committee.
The motion was agreed to.
FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 77, an Act to repeal the
Biological Board Act and to create The Fisheries Research Board of Canada.
He said: The Biologicail Board of Canada
was established originally by Order in Council in 1898. It consisted of the then Commissioner of Fisheries, the late Professor
Prince, and certain professors of universities
then doing biological research work. Its first
laboratory was a floating one. It was designed
to be towed around the coast from place to
place where work was being carried on. For
many years the board confined its work to

271

investigations of the fauna and flora of the
sea, or, in other words, to marine animal and
vegetable life.
In the course of time the board's work was
extended to both coasts and two important
permanent stations were established, one at
St. Andrews, N.B., and the other at Departure
Bay, near Nanaimo, B.C.
In 1912 it was decided to establish the
board by legislation and the Biological Board
Bill was enacted. As time went on the board,
at the instance of the department, undertook
more and more investigational work not only
into the natural history of fish, but also into
problems arising in the preparation of fish for
market.
By 1923 the board, the industry and the
department were working so closely together
that it was decided to amend section 4 of the
Act so as to provide that the board should
consist of seven members appointed by the
Minister, in addition to the scientific members
from the universities. After this amendment
two representatives from the department and
two from the industry, one from each coast,
were appointed to the board, and it has
since been so constituted that it represents the
Administration, the industry and science.
The work of the board has been continually
expanding. In addition to the scientific stations at St. Andrews and Departure Bay, there
is now on each coast-at Halifax and Prince
Rupert--what is known as a fisheries experimental station. These stations are designed
to do for the industry all that an experimental
farm can do for agriculture. They deal with
problems experienced by the industry in preparing fish for market, and carry on investigations looking to the development of better
methods of processing fish. They also conduct
courses of instruction not only for our fishery
officers, but as well for representatives of the
industry.
More recently other sub-stations have been
established, one at Bideford, P.E.I., for oyster
development work, and another on the Gaspé
coast to meet the requirements of the Frenchspeaking portion of the fishing industry.
This is the present membership of the
board: Professor A. T. Cameron, Winnipeg,
Manitoba, Chairman; J. J. Cowie, Ottawa,
Secretary-Treasurer; John Dybhavn, Prince
Rupert, B.C.; Professor R. J. Bean, Halifax,
N.S.; Professor A. H. Hutchinson, Vancouver,
B.C.; Professor J. Playfair McMurrich, Toronto, Ont.; Professor W. T. MacClement,
Kingston, Ont.; Professor H. G. Perry, Wolfville, N.S.; J. A. Rodd, Ottawa, Ont.; Professor W. P. Thompson, Saskatoon, Sask;
Professor D. L. Thomson, Montreal, Que.; A.
Handfield Whitman, Halifax, N.S., and Professeor Alexandre Vachon, Quebec City.

272

SENATE

The legislation now proposed is requested
bv the board itself after it has given consideration to the matter from all standpoints. The
main objects of the Bill are to constitute a
board which will not become unwieldy in
size, as it might under the present Act, and to
give the board a name indicating the work in
which it is engaged.
The present appropriation for the board is
$201.300. As this aspect of the matter wiii be
open for consideration when the fisheries estimates are being dealt with in the other House,
I vili not discuss it now.
The explanatory notes in the Bill are so
aiquate that I assume honourable senators
would dc trn further explanation unnecessary.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I understand
that the main purpose of the Bil is to change
the naine of the present board.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: That is all.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: The Biological
Board was formerly a separate organization and
did not come under the jurisdiction of the
Miniter of Fisheries. In 1920 I introduced in
the other House a Bill to place the board
under the Minister's autihority. That Bill was
rejected by this honouraible Chamber after a
very distinguished professor-he has since departed this life-had carried on an active lobby
against it. Is this new organization to come
under the personal direction of the Minister?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
able friend read the Bill?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Has my honourNo.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
does.

I think it

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Bill says:
In this Act, unless the context otherwise

requires

Board of Canada";
Mîiistera
ienans the Minister of Fisieries;
"Depiaritment" meaus the Departnent of
Fisheries.
There shall be a body to be called "The
Fisheries Research Board of Canada" which
shall be under the control of the Minister.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: That is it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The Board shall consist of fifteen nembers
appointed by the Minister as follows: two
frein the Department, two representing the
fishery industry on the Atlantic coast, two
representing the fishery industry on the Pacific
coast. and nine scientists selected from a list
including nominations which may be made by
any Canadian university whose staff embraces
scientists engaged in research work in any way
bearing upon fislery problerms; provided that
for subsequent appointments of scientific members a list including nominations as aforesaid
shall be supplied to the Minister by the Board.
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: It is quite clear
that it comes under the Minister. I am satisfied.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think this Bill
was very closely studied by the members of
the board. Thev are confident that we will
endorse their work.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: In years past
the Biological Board just went its own way,
and very few problems were referred to the
Minister or discussed with him. I hope that
under this Bill the Minister, who is given the
authority lie should always have had. will
keep very close personal supervision over the
new board.
Hon. WILLIAM DUFF: Honourable senators, I do not intend to detain the House
for more than a few moments. I agree with
the honourable senator from Alma (Hon.
Mr. Ballantyne) that all this Bill really involves is a change in the narne of the board.
From my knowledge of the old Biological
Board I do not believe the new board can
do any more than was done in the past. I
remember distinctly the time when my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) brought
up this matter. Whether any credit is dute
to him or not, the fact remains that most of
the men appointed to the board at that time
were practical men. My only objection to
this Bill-and I am not going to oppose it
strongly, because it does not mean very much
-is
that it reduces the number of practical
men on the board and provides for the appointnent of scientists fron the different colleges of this country. While, of course, we
must have scientists, men of exceptional education and ability, it seems to me that the
majority of the board should be practical men
in the fisheries, not men from the universities.
The Bill says there are to be only two
practical men frorm the Pacifie coast and two
from the Atlantic coast. On the old board
we had men from the biological stations at
Halifax and St. Andrews on the Atlantic,
and Prince Rupert on the Pacifie, and those
men, working with Handfield Whitman and
other practical men, did splendid work. Perhaps it was just as well that when they came
to a decision they did not report to the
Minister, but carried on by themselves. I am
sure it would be just as well if there were no
reports to-day, because practical men who
understand the needs of the industry are in a
better position to say what should be done
than are some of the officials of the department.

APRIL 1, 1937
The Bill says there are to be-nine scientists selected f rom a Iist including
nominations which may bie made by any Canadian university wvhose staff embraces scientists
engaged ini research work in any way bearing
upon fishery problems.
If we are ever going to get 'anywhere with
t'lit fisheries of this country it will flot be. by
engaging scienjtists from the universities. Durimg the last forty-five years I have 'hea-rd a
good deal said about when the mackerel wouid
be on the At]antic coast, when the herring
would corne, and wlien the lobsters we're going
to crawl, but I bave naeyer yet knownl a
scienitist who could foreteIl those things as
weli as the nild fishermen who was out in bis
boat in the rain and the storm from dawn. to
dark. Perýhaps it is flot worth mentioning,
but ail] these prof&ssors don is to coame be
to have a go-od time. As fear as anyt.hing of
practical value is concerned it, wouli be much
better just to tak-e the men et the Halifax,
St. Andrews and Prince Rupert stations and
have them woi-k wit'h the practical men w'ho
know something about the industry.
The motion, was agreed to, and the Bill was

but are made to harmonize wîth Canadian conditions in matters of administration and procedure, and are eniarged to cover modemn

secoond reeding of Bill 75, an Act respecting
the establishment of a National Park in tbe
Province of New Brunswick and to amcnd
The Nova Sc-otia and Prinoe Edward Island
National Parks Act, 1936.
He said: Honourable senetors, perbaps it
wiii be sufficient to read two clauses of tbe
Bili wbich is before us. Clause 2 sa.ys:
The Governor in Council may, by proclamation, set aside as a National Park of Canada,
sueli lands in the province of New Brunswick

the province furnishes Canada with e clear titie
to the said lands, and upon the issue of such
proclamation the said National Park shall be

Act, chapter thîrty-three of the statutes of 1930.
Clause 3 says:
Section three of The Nova Scotia and Prince
Edward Island National Parks Act, 1936, ehapter forty-three of the statutes of 1936, is
amended hy adding thereto the following sulisection:
(2) The Governor in Council may, by proclamation, withdraw from the said Park such
lands in Cape Breton as may bie agreed upon
hy the province of Nova Scotia and by Canada,
and the Governor in Council may thereupon
re-vest such lands in the province.
Then there are the expienetory notes:

made, which necessitates certain changes in
this boundary as described in the original Act
to meet local conditions. It will be necessary
to add certain areas, authority for which was
provided in the original Act, and also to withdraw certain areas which the detailed survey
discloses are not now necessary from a park
point of view.
The provision herewith is to authorize the
Governor in Council to withdraw from the
park any areas which the official plan of the
survey of the boundaries, which has not yet
been issued, shows as lying outside the boundaries as finally selected and surveyed.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I would ask whether the
Governor in Council, when land is taken out
of a park, as contemplated by this Bill in
respect of the Cape Breton Island Park, can
convey it to whomsoever he wishes. I should
think he must convey it back to the province
whieh gave it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should surmise
as much, as it is the province that gives the
land.
Hon. Mr. COPP: The Bill provides for revesting in the province.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Can I get
any information as to where the park in New
Brunswick is likely to be? All of New
Brunswick that I ever saw is admirably
suited for a national park.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My right honourable friend's leader in the other House
asked whether it would not be in his old
county, and in reply the Minister said:
I suggest that my right honourable friend
may still live in hope. The difficulty in New
Brunswick is that there are several sites under
consideration. Under the Parks Act the Provincial Government has to give to the federal
authority with clear title the area set aside
for a park. In the older settled provinces
this involves the acquisition of the site. I had
hoped to be in a position to state to the
committec when this measure was brought down
that a particular site had been selected, and
what its boundaries would be, but unfortunately
I am not in that position. We desire to get
a start made on the park in New Brunswick,
and we are asking in the Bill for authority to
define the area by Order in Council.
So we are not much further advanced. The
Minister has not stated the nature of the difficulties in the way of the New Brunswick
Government offering a certain area.
The Minister added:
There have been some changes in Nova Scotia
in the boundaries of the park as defined a year
ago, the Provincial Government having discovered that it would be put to considerable
expense to acquire some of the area included
in the boundaries as defined at that time.
There are certain problens of mineral rights
which they had not considered before, which
might lead te an uncertain financial liability.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

But we are adding an area to the park which,
in the opinion of the parks officials who have
examined it, will add to the usefulness and
attractiveness of the park.
Sites are examined first by officials from the
Parks Branch of the Federal Governient, but
my honourable friend must remember that the
area has to be given to the Federal Government
by the Provincial Government free of charge,
with a clear title. That mneans that the Provincial Government has to be a consenting party
to the area set aside.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

AGREEMENT

BILL

SECOND READING

Hou. Mr. DANDURAND
moveil the
second reading of Bill 76, an Act to authorize an agreement between His Majesty the
King and the Corporation of the City of
Ottawa.
He said: Honourable senators, the object
of this Bill is to extend the agreement between His Majesty the King and the Corporation of the City of Ottawa. under which
the federal treasury pays $100,000 annually to
the city.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Honourable senators, I
do not wish to oppose the passing of this
Bill, which provides for payment of $100Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:

$100.000.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Perhaps $100
is what my honourable friend thought it
ought to be.
Hon. Mr. COTE: The Bill could not be
much more unjust. I suppose,. if it provided
for payment of only $100. I am rising to
say that although the city is grateful for the
$100,000, that amount is a mere pittance in
comparison with the value of municipal services which the Government enjoys with respect to its properties, which are immune
from taxation. This sum is but a small fraction of what the Government would have to
pay if all the property it owns in Ottawa were
assessed and taxed as other property i.. As
stated in the explanatory notes accompanying
the Bill, the agreement originally provided
for an annual payment of $75.000. It was
obviously a one-sided agreement, because
the Government was under no legal obligation

APRIL 1, 1937
to pay anything. In 1925 the amount was increased to $100,000. 1 know that the Mayor
of Ottawa, members of the City Council and
citizens in general think this arnount is altogether inadequate and, 1 think I can say,
quite unfair.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The hionourable gentleman does not suggest that this
represents everything the Government gives
in return for services rendered?
Hon. Mr. COTE: No. The Government
spends other sums in the city of Ottawa.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Vast sums.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have prev-iously expressed in this Chamber the opinion
that the city of Ottawa should be made a

of Columbia is administered by the United
States. I arn unable to state off-hand just
what advantages the citizens of Ottawa would
receive through this change, but possibly they
wou]d be quite satisfied to live under the
administration of a, commission appointed by
the Dominion Government.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Personally I should flot

FOREIG'N ENLISTMENT BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE
Un motion of Hon. Mr. Dandtîrand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 23, an
Act respecting Foreign Enlistment.
Hon. Mr. Robinson in the Chair.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I wou]d suggest
that if any honourable senator bas any amendments in mind he should direct attention
to the clauses affected. so that we may adopt
the other clauses without discussion.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: 1 wjsh to make
just a general observation. There are a
number of Imperial statutes in force in
Canada, some of wlieb are niot iînrelated to
this measure, and they should be looked into
by the law officers. My recollection is that
the Armny Act and the Muî.iny Act, among
a nuîmbor of others. are applicable to Canada.
AI! the law contained in the King's Regulations and Orders for the Canadian militia
is largely from Imperial statutes. I suggest
our law oflcers should ascertain what Imperial
legislation, particularly suclb as deals xxith
military matters. applies to tbis country, and
rex amp it to suit our needs. Unless that is
done xxe may find ourselves in some difficulties
in the evenit of an emergenry. Tbe matter

APRIL 2, 1937
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Not just yet.
What I had in mind and now suggest is that
the expression " friendly foreign state " should
be defined. This expression occurs in section 3:
If any person, being a Canadian national,
within or without Canada, accepts or agrees to
accept any commission or engagement in the
armed forces of any foreign state at war with
any friendly foreign state, or, whether a Canadian national or not, within Canada, induces
any other person to accept or agree to accept
any commission or engagement in any such
armed forces, such person shall be guilty of an
offence under this Act.
The words " foreign state " are defined as
including:
any foreign prince, colony, province or part
of any province or people, or any person or
persons exercising or assuming to exercise the
powers of government in or over any foreign
country, colony, province, or part of any province or people.
J am informed that in the British Act a
friendly state is defined as a state at peace
with His Majesty. There appears on the
surface to be a difference between that term
and the term "friendly foreign state " as used
in our section 3. Why should not "friendly
foreign state " be defined by a new clause
(g) of section 2 as "a foreign state at peace
with His Majesty"?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I doubt whether
there is any need for clarifying the expression
" friendly foreign state " as contained in
section 3. It seems to me it is synonymous
with a foreign state with which we are at
peace.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The British
Act uses the expression "a foreign state at
peace with His Majesty."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
what is a friendly state?

Does it define

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It does not
use the term " friendly foreign state," which
we have adopted. I admit quite frankly that
I submitted this matter to Parliamentary
Counsel. He thinks there is no danger in
using that term, but I incline to the view that
it is better to use terms which have always
been used.
Hon. Mr. COTE: May I suggest that the
reason for not adopting a definition was to get
away from a difficulty which might be involved
in accepting the definition in the British Act.
This definition says that a friendly state is a
state which is at peace with His Majesty. Of
course, " His Majesty " means His Britannic
Majesty the King of England, the King of
Canada, the King of Australia, and so on.
If we inserted the Imperial definition, and
Australia only were at war with a foreign
state-

That might

Hon. Mr. COTE: Yes. Obviously, whoever
drafted this Bill did not want to settle that
moot and difficult point.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Perhaps we had
better accept the Bill as drafted.

not assume there can be war and peace at
the same time in the same country.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Should not
the word "voluntarily" be inserted in clause
3 before the word "accepts"? Certainly it ia
against the law of nations for another country to compel a national of this country toý
enlist in its armed forces, but conceivably it
might be done.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Does not the
word "accepts" cover the point?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh. no. He
might accept an engagement under compulsion.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: He might

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: He might be

of which did not recognize Canadian naturalization, and therefore would conscript him.
When he came back to Canada he might
be found guilty of foreign enlistment.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: No foreign nation
can conscript a British subject.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: A somewhat similar
condition did exist in the late War. Germans, nationals of the United States, who
happened to be in Germany at the time war
broke out were forced into the German army.
The insertion of the word "voluntarily" before the word "accepts" would at least free
our nationals from prosecution after they
returned to Canada. If of German or Japanese origin it is conceivable they might be
conscripted.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Germany
disregards naturalization laws of other countries and would still treat those men as its
own nationals.

SUPREME COURT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 78, an Act to amend
the Supreme Court Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this Bill is merely to clarify the meaning
of the present section 37 of the Supreme Court
Act. Under that section there is a right of
appeal per saltum when parties agree and
consent is given by the court of final resort
in the province.
This Bill is intended to
make it clear that the appeal must be from
a judgment which is applicable to that court
of final resort as well.
Per saltum appeals are appeals that are
allowed to jump over one tribunal, as it were,
and to reach a higher tribunal directly.
I may say that the interpretation of the
present section 37 has given some difficulty
to the Supreme Court of Canada, because
part of the section is anything but clear.
The Court has suggested the clarification
which is the object of this Bill. I can and
will give the Senate further information as
to the difficulty which the justices of the
Supreme Court have had in interpreting this
section, but I feel that when I have finished
honourable members will not be much more
enlightened than they are after the short
explanation I have given so far. I am citing
from a memorandum of the Minister of Justice.
Section 37, which is to be amended, and
which is reproduced in the explanatory notes
to the Bill, ýis the section of the Supreme
Court Act that provides for per saltum appeals. The other sections deal with appeals
dle plano. When in 1930 the section was
amended, the intention was that the leave
The Hon. the SPEAKER.

of the court of final resort in the province
should be required, as well as the consent of
the parties, as a condition precedent to an
appeal being permitted without the case going
to the court of appeal of the province. But
the language of the section does not express
the intention as clearly as it should have
been expressed. Perhaps I had better read
the present section 37:
Where the amount or value of the natter
in controversy in the appeal exceeds the sum
of two thousand dollars, subject to section
thirty-eight, an appeal shall lie directly to the
Supreme Court from any final judgment of a
provincial court, whether of appellate or
original jurisdiction, other than the highest
court of final resort in the province, pronounced
in a judicial proceeding. which is not one of
those specifically excepted in section thirty-six,
(a) by leave of the highest court of final
resort having jurisdiction in the province in
which the proceedings were originally instituted; and
(b) by consent in writing of the parties. or
their solicitors, verified by affidavit and filed
with the registrar of the Supreme Court and
with the registrar, clerk or prothonotary of the
court to be appealed fromThis amendment was made in 1930 at the
request of the judges of the Supremie Court
themselves, and the intention was that both
conditions should be fulfilled, namely. the consent of the parties to pass over one tribunal,
plus the leave of the court of final reort; but
apparently it has been considered by sote that
the conditions were alternative, and this is the
kernel of the difficulty. Cases in wlich the
two conditions have not been compliel with
have come to the Supreme Court here. AIthough the Supreme Court has maintained
that it was intended both should be required,
it is thought better to clarify the situation so
that no ambiguity may continue to exist.
The purposes of the present amendmnent are
expressed very clearly. The judges of the
Supreme Court had a hand in the preparation of the Bill. Those purposes ar: first,
that no suitor who has obtained judgmint in
his favour in a provincial court shall. without
his consent, be brought by way of appeal before the Supreme Court without the opportunity of having jûdgment pronounced upon
his case by the court of last resort in the
province; second, that on public grounds the
consent of the parties shall not in itself be
sufficient to entitle either of them to come
before the Supreme Court per saltum, but shall
be supplemented by leave of the provincial
court of final resort; third, that there shall be
no right of appeal per saltum except upon
some question of law, for it seems obvious
that questions of fact, before coming to the
Supreme Court, should he pronounced upon
by the court of last resort in the province; and

APRIL 5, 1937
fourth, that there shall be no appeai per
saitum from provincial tribunals presided over
by persons appointed hy authority of the Provincial Legisiature. Such tribunals, as a rule,
are mainly concernied with controversies relating to matters which are solely administrative in their character. 0f course, thi8 applies
only ta appeals per saltum and flot to appeals
de piano, when there is a final judgment by
the court of Iast resort in the province. The
main purpose is to provide that when there
is no appeal to the court of final resart in
the province there shall fot be an appeal to
the Supreme Court of Canada. I think the
aim of the Bill is merely ta clarify the situation that already exists, which bas created
some difficuities and been the cause of some
litigation.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Which court wilI
determine whet:-her there, is a -rigiht of appeail
-the Supreme Court or the court of highest
jurisdiction in the province itself?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As I read the
explanations given, my answer would be that
both the highest court in the pro-vince and
the Supreme Court would give assent.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill
was read the second time.

Hon. Mr. COTE: Are we ta understand
that leave must be obtained bath fra.m the
highest court of appeal in the province and
from the Supreme Court itself?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I wili read the
clause:
37. (1) Subject ta section thirty-eight hereof,
where the amount or value of the matter in
cootroversy in the appeal exceeds the sumn of
two thousand dollars, an appeal shail lie directly
ta the Supremne Court in respect of a question
of law alone fram a final judgment pronaunced
in a judicial proceeding by a provincial court
of which the judges are appointed by the
Governor General, upon leave being granted ta
that effect by the highest court of final resort
in the province in which the praceedings were
originally inistituted, and provided that the
consent in writing of the parties, or their
solicitors, verified by affidavit is filed with
the Registrar of the Supremne Court and with
the registrar, clerk or prothonatary of the court
ta be appealed from.
(2) No such leave shall be granted by the
highest court of final resort uniess an appeal
would lie ta such court of final resort and also
ta the Supreme Court from the judgmnent of
such court pronounced in such appeal.
(3) Save as pravided by this section, but
subject ta section forty-four, no appeal shahl lie
ta the Supreme Court except from the highest
court of final resort having jurisdiction in the
province in which the proceedings were
originally înstituted.

As I read the explanation, I took it for
granted that application had ta, be made ta
the Supreme Court.
Hon. Mr. COTE: But there is nathing in
the section as amended which refers ta the
necessity of obtaining leave from the Supremne
Court itseif?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No; but ahl the
same I believe there must be application ta
the Supreme Court for leave.
Hon. Mr. COTE: At any rate, if such a
necessity exista, it exista by virtue of some
section not touched by this Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. LEGER: I think the explanation
is fully given in the note on page 2. It would
seem that permission ta appeal ta the Supreme
Court would be required oniy when the provincial court had negatived the right ta appeal.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 0f course. it
goes without saying that the Supreme Court,
when applied ta, would see that ýail these conditions had been complied with.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.

Hon. J. P. MOLLOY: I assure honourable

reason for speaking is that in the course of bis

word which impels me ta say something in

The debate was opened by the honourable

within the ranks of the Government itself.
Before mv Maker I soiemnly declare that I
could flot understand-and for some days the
question bothered me-how a member of any
party or any fragment of a party could object
to the defence proposai. of the Governmcnt.
I said to myself that there must be a reason.
And, honourable members, there is a reason:
they are afraid of being drawn into the maw
of the war machine, the cylinder of which is
continuous in its revolutions and crushes and
grinds down the citizenship, the common
people of a country. I arn aiways proud to
state 1fhat 1 corne of the common people. There
may bc soine who think they sit here by
-divine right, that they are the chosen of the
Lord's ânointed. If there 'are any such, I
would say to them: "Please dispel any such
thought from your mind. Please remnember
that, after ail, you are only common dlay,
common mud, and some of the mud is none
too fertile at that." I stand here as a supporter of the man whose name I will remember
longer than that of anyonc else, and to whose
memory I wiii pay tribute. But it would be
impossible for me to express so great a eulogy
of Sir Wilfrid Laurier as was expressed just a
few days ago by the leader of the Conservative
party. Sir Wilfrid Laurier's chie-f objet was
to do everything he could for the land he
loved, and that explains why he introduced,
8upported and had Parliarnent pass the naval
poiicy of this country.
There is in Canada to-day what Iwill describe as a Jingo element. It has always been
here. and perhaps it always will be. Jingoes,
or some of them, wili say to you-or, if they
do flot say it, they will think it-that Laurier
is dead. I reply to thern t-hat the name and
the spirit of Laurier are stili powerful, and
that one hundred years fromn now his star
will bc more radiant and more respiendient
than it was on the l7th of December, 1917,
when his comnbined enemies succeeded in defeating the greatest character that I have ever
known in the public life of this country.
Now, before I close I want to give a word of
warning to my honourable friend from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach). He told us,
in words that to me were impressive, that if
we were living in other lands we could not
take the course that we are taking. He said
that if we were in France we should be conscripted, taxed and made to do whatever the
Government of France ordered. In answer to
that, let me say Vo him that we are noV in
France and that we neyer will be under the
flag of France so long as the sun shines and
one Canadian is ef t alive. My honourable
friend says that in that country there is
liberty. I say to you, honourabie members,
that in any country wbere conscription is the

law there is no liberty. And, should. it ever
become necessary, I will devote the rernaining
days of my life, whether they be many or few,
týo trying to insure that conscription neyer
again shall be the law in this country. We

had one bitter experience with that law.
My honourable friend from Edmonton aiso
said that if we tried. Vo make effective a
policy of neutrality in time of war, the resuit
would be a civil war in this country. That
is a strong statement, but I accept it. And
I can tell my honourable friend of two
things which would be rnuch more expeditious than neutrality in producing a civil war
in Canada: they are anýother War-time Elctions Act and conscription, as introduced, supported and made Iaw by a party that rny
honourable friend supported. If you want, a
civil war in this country-God forbid that
there should be one!-another Act like
that, and conscription, would be the shortest
road to it. If it ever does happen, Canada
will not want to experience another civil war

for at lest a hundrcd years. The War-time
Elections At-I know what I am talking
about-prevented the mother of a man who
is an ornarnent to the House of Commons,
an ornament to the G-overnrnent Vo which
he belongs and an ornament to public life,
from voting for her own son. Twenty years
have gone by, and there is a new element in
Canada to-day, an elernent which has informed
itself upon what took place in 1917. Conscription is to me an ugly, a hideous. a
bloody, a repugnant word. The blood within
me flows a little faster when, in a country
like this, where I believe we ahl are free men
and wornen, 1 arn told that we may again
be subWet to conscription-a thing wbich
caused a wound so wide that the sutures of
a generation have not been long enough or
strong enough Vo bring together the opposite parts. Conscription would draw us into
the war machine, whose revolving cylinders
wouid grind and crush our freedom. Conscription would iead the fluwer of this coutry's rnanhood to the shambles and their
mothers to the madhouse, just Vo make a
holiday for the barbarians of Europe.
I say to my trusted and honourabie leader
on Vhs side of tbe House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) that aIl my life I have been a docile,
faithful and loyal follower and supporter of
the party to> which we belong, and I would ask
that if he speaks in this debate-as 1 think
iV is his duty to do-he wiil tell the young

men and the fathers and mothers of this
country whether, in the event of war, we
shah bhave to endure again anything like what
occiirred in this country in 1917.

SENATE
I have every faith in those who will represent us at the Imperial Conference.
They
will not pay any attention to what I say,
nor is it necessary that they do so, but I
hope that as Canadians they will do what
they believe is in the interest of the country
in which they and I were born.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: My second question
is a very short one.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Will the honourable gentleman allow me to ask him a couple
of questions, which he can answer at his
leisure? Is he aware of the words, "Si vis
pacem, para bellum-if you want peace, prepare for war"? That has long been an axiom,
and it is full of common sense. The Good
Book teaches the same thing, that one will
hesitate to attack a man who is well armed
to defend himself. That is the first question
I woull ask my honourable friend to answer.
Then, does he believe-

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The honourable
gentleman expressed very high praise of Sir
Wilfrid Laurier. Well. no one liked Sir Wilfrid
Laurier more than I did, and I doubt whether
anyone here knew him longer or was more
intimate with him than . When I was a
lad he came to my father's house. However,
never mind that. I want to ask the honourable gentleman if he will deny that Sir
Wilfrid Laurier said. "When the Empire is at
war, we are at war."

Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: One question at a
time. My honourable friend says. "If you
want peace, prepare for war." I quoted a few
moments ago a famous French marshal who
said, "If you want war, arm for war." It is
not necessary that we should go to look for
trouble. So why should we prepare for war?
Nobody is interfering with us, nor are we interfering with any other nation on the face of the
earth. Luckily for us, we live in a very
favoured geographical position. We are on
the northern half of North America. Who
dare attack us, unless willing to fight not only
England, but also the United States? I am
not an anti-Imperialist, but I am a Canadian
before being an Imperialist. I am for Canada
first, last and all the time. I am for Canada,
and Canada alone, and I refuse to take part in
any further European war. Unless I am
greatly mistaken, we never shall be asked to
do so. I may tell my honourable friend that
Australia, through the mouth of her ex-Prime
Minister. Mr. Hughes, has already stated that
she would refuse to send any men on
another expedition te Europe. Why should
we be drawn into the maelstrom?
Last night I listened to a speech over the
radio delivered under the auspices of the
Kelsey Club by Professor MacFarlane, Professor of History at the University of Manitoba. What did ho say? He recommended
that Canada should mind her own business.
England has always minded her business, down
through the centuries, and that explains why
England is the power that she is to-day.
"By sunny smiles of patriotism"-to quote
words spoken by Sir Wilfrid Laurier some
years ago-did she win India. South Africa
and Canada? No. She won them all in the
interest of her trade and commerce.
Now, what is my bonourable friend's
second question?
Hon. AIr. MOLLOY.

Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: The shorter the better.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I do not know about
that.
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: The better for me.

there was one meeting at which, by invitition
of Sir Robert Horne, who had been or was
then Chancellor of the Exchequer of Great
Britain, delegates were present from all parts
of our wonderful Empire, which comprises
one-quarter of the world's area and population.
A delegate fron Ireland got up and proposed
exactlv what my honourable friend has been
proposing. that in the event of England
becoming engaged in war the Dominions could

mild way, answered: "It

TRANS-CANADA AIR UINES BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 74, an Act to establi,3lî
a corporation to be known as Trans-Canada
Air Lines.
He said: Honourahie senators. the purpose
of this Bill is the formation of a company to
operate a first-class air service from coast
to coasýt in Canada. I take it for granted
that most of us are aware of the necessitv
for zuelb a service. Canada is perhaps one of
the fow countries in the world without a
national scheduled air service, The air services fromn our centres of population to areas
ot otherwise served by transportation take

APRIL 5, 1937
second place to none. but we are woefully
behind other countries in air services between
centres of population. During the -calendar
vear 1936 over one million people travelled
in scheduled air flights in the United States.
(Janadian citizens, travelling from one zone
to another in Canada, often find they have to
use air lines in the United States, and there
bas been a very insistent demand for the
establishment of a direct Canadian service.
Air mail stamps are sold in Canada and
mucli of our mail is routed across the border,
transported by the air services of the United
States. and then brouglit back across the
border at the point nearest te, destination.
The volume of this air mail is sufficient to
warrant the establishment of a direct service
in Canada. I believe such a service would
prove of immense value for national purposes.
Canada is a country of v'ast distances and
sparse population, and the time needed to
travel between the West and the East is considerable under present circumstances. If that
time could be cut in three or four by a new
air service, the people living at the extremes
of this country would be able to travel more
frequcntly to the centres of government.
business and industry, and the interrelations of
the country would therebv lie facilitated. The
need for a service of this kind lias been
recognized for some considerable time. As a
means of relieving iînemployment the c'onftrucetion of airports was commenced from
coast to coast. The work on the airports bas
been continued since the labour camps were
closed. It is expected that the airports from
WVinnipeg westwvard will be entirely completed
liv Julv 1 next, and the other fields liv the
end of the present year. The time bas now
come to undertake the flying of thîs route,
and the Government bas been faced with the
question how it can best lie done. Numerous applications have been received from
companies willing and eager to perform this
service. Pressure has been brouglit to bear on
tlie Government on behaîf of several of these
eompanies, and also on bebaîf of companies
which are performing similar services in the
United States.
We had several examples to guide us. We
had the example of Britain and its development of air services through Imperial Airways. The British Government owns twentyfive per cent of the capital stock; in addition,
aIl the operations undertaken by direction of
the British Government are sulisidized, by it.
The method is to, estima-te in advance the
deficit. for the year and to pay over in advance
to the company the money to cover the
e,-timated deficit.

289

The United States have developed air
services along different lines. T-here it lias
been a matter of competition, extending over
some ten years.
In the early days mail
subsidies were granted which would now lie
considered very large; they amounted to
about four times the present mail sulbsidies.
Companies were authorized to fly certain services and the lines were liuilt up in that way,
the only form. of sulisidy being the contracts
awarded for the carniage of the mail. Thi?'
led te, a somewhat chaotic experience. Companies have been for.med, and have disappeared
or been merged with other companies. Three
or four years ago there was a general writingdown of mail contracts; they were suspended
for a time, and the United States Government
undertook to perform the service with its own
planes, hcause the contract arrangement was
not considered satisfactory. Subsequently new
contracts were made with private firms, and
to-day, I think, the United States is operating
on a very efficient basis--as efficient perhaps
as any country in tbe world. But it seems to,
me that this mode of arriving -at the end
desired could be bettered by a country like
Canada, able to profit liy the experience of
otbers.
The company contemplated by this Bill is
to be organized as a private corporation. Ilt
is not the intention of the Government to own
directly any stock in the company.
The
agency for organizing the company is to be
the Government's existing agency for the conduct of transportation business, namely, the
Canadian National Railways. The Canadian
National Railways will underwrite, in the flrst
instance, the stock of this company and distribute it a.mong firms at present engaged in
aviation in Canada which wish to participate.
It mighýt be argued that the Government
should do this direct, but everyone here will
appreciate the impossibility of working out a
plan involving a great number of competitors
when tbe Government itself does not know the
plan, which it cannot know until one bas lieen
approved by Parliament. The Government
bas ther-efore decided that the proper course
is to determine the form of the company, to
entrust the underwriting to the National Railways, to ask that after the .termis of the
arrangement are known those desiring to participate will signify te, what degree they are
interested and will state what they can contribute towards tbe enterprise in the way of
experienced personnel and perhaps equipment,
and the.n to ailow the company's problem to
be worked out after the Bill has been passed.
This company will fly on-ly the miain artery

Government as being of national importance.
It is not the intention to interfere with any
existing operations. The company will not
undertake interurban services of any kind.
It will be given an exclusive contract to carry
mails, passengers and express over the specified routes. In the initial stages of the company, in addition to its having an air mail
contract at a rate competitive with similar
services on this continent, its deficits will be
paid by -the Government for two years, during
which period we anticipate the personnel will
bc perfected, and at the end of that time it
can reasonably be expected that an efficient
service will be in operation. Subsequently
the company will receive an air mail contract
the basis of which will bc determined bv the
operations of the previous year. The setup is such that the company will be protected
against loss, but its profits will be very strictly
limited. In other words, it is organized to
perform a certain national service, and it is
expected that that service will be performed
at or near cost.
As honourable members know. this Government is obligated to share in the proposed
service now being organized between England,
Ireland, and Canada to cross the north Atlantic. In that connection we have undertaken to
be prepared to fly the mails across Canada,
connecting with their flighît across the Atlantic.
For that reason it is urgent to form this coipany and get the organization under way,
and obtain the necessary equipment to undertake the service.
It is estimatel that the capital required to
purchase the equipment necessary to perform
the service in Canada is about $1.750.000. In
addition. about $1,250,000 is required as part
of Canada's capital for the transatlantic
scrvire. The balance of $2,000,000 is provided
to be called upon as required for the expansion
of the services as national needs may indicate. The cost of operation of the service
-the
coast to coast service-is estimated at
about 81,000.000 a year.
This will represcnt the total operating cost.
It is tbought that from the start the mail contract and suchi passenger and express business as is immediatelv available should cover
the cost of the service. We have made provision, however. for a subsidy to protect the
service in that period. After 1940. as I have
said, the subsidy provision expires, and the
mail contract will be on the basis of cost of
the service. I think that outlines fairly wel
the intention of the Bill. The whole matter
can be more fully considered when the Bill
is before the Railway Committee.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: I do not know
a great deal about this Bill. When it was
before the other House objection was taken
to the Government not retaining control of
the company. It appears that $5,000.000 capital
is necessary. It was first intended that the
service should be operated and controlled by
the Canadian National Railways. I understand that the honourable Minister bas since
made a change in the Bill, and that control is
now vested in the Government. In other
words, the Government will hold fifty-one per
cent of the stock. Can the honourable leader
state whether that is correct?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Section 7 of the
Bill provides:
7. (1) The authorized capital of the corporation shall bc five million dollars divided into
shares of one hundred dollars each, represented by share certificates.
(2) The shares of the capital stock of the
corporation shall bc offered for subscription
to the Canadian National Railway Company
at par.
(3) The Canadian National Railway Company
is hereby authorized to subscribe for, underwrite. purchase. hold. and, subject to the provisions of this Act. sell and dispose of the shares
of the capital stock of the corporation.
Provided however that the Canadian National
Railway Company shall not sell or dispose of
more than twenty-four thousand nine hundred
shares except with the approval of Parliament.
The Canadian National Railway
would retain control.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I think my

Han. Mr. MURDOCK: Read section il toa.
I think that clinches it. It says:
Il. (1) The Minister shall, with the approval
of the Governor in Council, be entitled at any
time to acquire from the shareholders all of
the shares of the capital stock of the Corporation on payment ta the shareholders of the book
value thereof, and the Governor in Council may
by aider vest the said shares ini the Minister.
(2) The book value of the shares shall, in
the event of disagreement, be determined by a
reference by the Minister to the Exchequer
Court of Canada.
(3) The Trans-Canada contract shail not be
deemned ta have any value or to be an asset
to be taken inta cansideration in determaining
the book value of the shares.
(4) The shares shall, upun acquisition by the
Minister, be held in trust for His Majesty.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Honourable senators, if
the Bill goes ta the Comrnittee on Railways,
Telegraphs and Harbours, we can then go into
ail these matters and get the explanations.
flan. WILLIAM DUFF: Honourable senators, what we have ta consider is the principle
of the Bill. The question involved, it seerns
ta me, is whether we should ernbark on
another publicly owned enterprise. I have
always been opposed ta public ownership, and
I still arn. It is for us te, decide now whether
we are going ta agree ta the principle of public
ownership or flot. What I cannot understand
-and, upon nîy word.
because if there is a Grit Iin arn ernbarrassed,'

Some Hon. SENATORS: No, nu.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Yes, I arn. I have always

Hon. Mr. LAIRD:

Not a dirty, low one.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Yes. I have done some
things I shouhd flot like ta tell my mother-inlaw about.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
flan. Mr. DUFF: I do nat understand why
an important measure hike this should be
thrown into the whirlpool of politics at the
shank end of the session, when we are almost
ready ta prorogue. This is a very important
measure, and deals with a matter that should
have the consideration not only of this flouse,
but of the people of the country.
I understand, of course, that we were compelled ta take over the system now known as
the Canadian National Railways. During the
years governments of bath political parties
31117-19J

gave subsidies and land grants te, the railways;
and, in the final anahysis, when the railways,
got into difficulties we had ta guarantee the
bonds and take over those railways.
Under this Bihl we are asked to authorize a
brand new public ownership undertaking. And
by whom? By a solvent concern? No. We
are asked ta authorize the Canadian National
Railways ta start a trans-Canada air line.
I arn going ta oppose the principle of this
Bill for three reasons. First, 1 arn opposed
ta public ownership; second, I arn opposed
ta the undertaking of such an enterprise by
the Canadian National Railways or any other
cornpany without resaurces which bas ta came
ta this Parliament year after year ta ask it
ta vote millions and tens of millions of
dollars ta make up deficits; and thirdly, I
arn oppased ta the Canadian National Railways taking over the trans-Canada air service, because in daing s0 they would be conipeting with themselves.
It is the rnost
ridiculous proceeding I ever heard of in my
hf e.
A few days ago the Minister of Transport
introduced into this Parhiament a Bihl ta
regulate rates on tbe Great Lakes and the
Atlantic. Hie was so eager ta get his Bill
passed that he dropped one clause after another when tbe Senate objected ta it, the
resuit being that the Bill which came back
here was sa ridicîîlaus that we voted against
it, and quite properly so. Now the Minister
cornes along and asks us by this Bill ta establisb a trans-c ontin ental1 air service.
What
happens if Parliament adapts the proposai?
Sarne body bas ta put up $5,000.000. The

LYNCIl-STAUNTON:
GEORGE
Hon.
Honourable senaters. 1 object te this Bill for
two reasens. We know that when a transcontiniental transportation systern xas unider-

APRIL 5, 1937
taken in the old days we were told it would
consist of one line across the continent, with
herring-bone lines running out from the
main line. Well, we bought a transcontinental
railway-what is now known as the Canadian
National Railways-and what did we do then?
We bought every jerkwater railway there
was in Canada to add to it. Everybody who
had a railway that did not pay sold it immediately to the National Railways, and the
cost was perhaps double what was originally
contemplated. Now this airway is established, and it too has a lot of herring-boneswhich are just about as valuable as ordinary
herring-bones. I venture to prophesy that
in the next five years we shall buy up every
branch line of airways running into any mining camp in Canada.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It is not necessary to buy any right-of-way, though.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I think
that if we pass a Bill of this kind we should
have in it a section to provide that we shall
not purchase any of what are called feeders
to these lines.
These air lines will not only compete with
the Canadian National Railways; they will
also carry the mails. What do the mails consist of? W-hy are we in such a hurry to
deliver mails across the continent? I think
that if you divided mail matter into its
component parts you would find that it usually
consists of patent medicine advertising andHon. Mr. LACASSE: Election circulars.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: -circulars sent out by members of Parliament to
their constituents, and love letters. I do not
believe that in every hundred pounds of mail
there is one pound that is of any importance.
Yet we seem to think there is so great a necessity for haste in delivering it that we should
increase the speed of transporting it across
the continent from 50 to 150 miles an hour.
Not only am I opposed to public ownership, but I have a constantly increasing regret
that I ever voted for the Canadian National
Railways at all. I might have known that once
we went into the business we would adopt
many things that we should not adopt in the
way of transportation. Instead of being a
benefit to Canada, transportation has become a
burden to it. If we had built sufficient facilities
for transporting our products across this continent, and no more, they would have been of
great assistance to us. Had we stuck to the
Canadian Pacific Railway, of which we all were
so proud for many years, we should have given
employment to a large number of our people
in an undertaking that could pay them prop-

293

erly; but we have so bedeviled the transportation facilities of this country that they are
now perhaps the greatest drag on Canada.
Year by year we are adding fifty or sixty million dollars to our debt, and there is not the
slightest chance of our ceasing to add that
sum every year during the lifetime of any
honourable member of this House.
Everybody knows in his heart that, beyond
any doubt, the day will come when our transportation system will either destroy our credit
or bankrupt our country. I know that all
Canadians realize this to be a fact. Yet, no
matter which party is in power, Parliament
dare not do anything about it. It is afraid of
the subject. Regardless of what the railway
asks or proposes, the Parliament of Canada
must bow down to it.
It is said that the Canadian National Railways want this Bill. I can hardly believe that.
I do not think the Canadian National officials originated this idea at all. I think that
for once in their lives, the only time since
the system has been established, they are
acknowledging that the Government is their
master.
Hon. FRANK P. O'CONNOR: Honourable
senators, I should like to say just a few words
in regard to this Bill. I have not prepared
anything at all, but I thought I might make a
few observations based on my insignificant
experience with transportation by air. Now,
it has been said that a large part of our mail
consiste of patent medicine advertising, love
lettersRight Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Candies.
Hon. Mr. O'CONNOR: -whatever
the
case may be. But I think honourable members would be glad to have the revenue, or
even one-tenth of the revenue, that the
Post Office Department receives for carrying
mail in just one year. Just as there are means
of producing that revenue, there must be
means of increasing it. The modern way of
stimulating business is to create your own
opposition. Take for illustration the Imperial
Tobacco Company. That company does not
sit idle and wait for a competitor to bring
out a new cigarette. No; it brings out one
itself, a new brand, and in this way creates its
own opposition. It will push the sales of that
new brand just as hard as any competitor
would, and make that new brand compete
with all its other brands. What is the idea
behind that method? It is to enlarge the
jack-pot, so to speak, for the general benefit
of the company.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: It is the same with
motor-car companies.

trucks-- were operating on the highway, and
we should have less trouble if they woro.
Howevor, the railways acted too slowly.
1 do flot know rnuch about this Bill, but
1 arn of opinion that since we realize we
made a mistake in allowing a great doal of
the transportation by land to slip beyond
control of tho railways, we should flot mako
a similar mistake witb regard to traffic by air.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:

I do flot

like to interrupt my right bonourablo friend,
but may I ask whether he can tell me ýhow
we, could have stopped competition by truck?
Hon. Mr. HARDY:
Why did we flot go
into the truck business?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
I do
flot understand my right honourable friond's
point.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: 1 arn sorry
about that. What I arn trying to say is that
if the Canadian National and the Canadian
Pacifie had introduced a good system of truck
services in the beginning, no one could have
successfully com.peted with them.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. COTE: May I again ask the lionourable leader of the House the reason for
participation by private interests to the extent
of 49 per cent of tbe stock of this publiclyowned company?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: While the bonourable
leader is looking for that information, will rny
honourable friend from Ottaw-va East (Hon.
Mr. Coté) state wbere the Bill provides for
public subscriptions?
Hlon. Mr. COTE: As the honourable senator
frorn Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) mentioned a moment ago, section 7 provides for it.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

No, it does flot.

Hon. Mr. COTE: It provides that the
capitalization shall be $5,000,000, and that the
shares sliall be offered for subscription to the
Canadian National Railway Company at par.
Then subsection 3 reads:
The Canadian National Railway Company is
hereby authorized to jsubseribe for, underwrite,
purchase, hiold, and, subject to the provisions
of this Act, seil and dispose of the shares of
the capital stock of the corporation.
Tbe Canadian National Railway Company is
authorized to subscribo for and seli the stock.
Then follows a limitation on the power of the
Canadian National Railway Company to dispose of the shares. It may dispose of not
more than about 49 per cent-24,900 shares.
It naturally follows that the Canadian National
will be the ownýer of haîf. plus 100 shares.

295

That constitutes control. I have asked
honourable leader of the Government to
me the reason for giving this option to
Canadian National Railway Company to
part of the stock to private interests.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I amn under the
impression that, in the other House, the honourable Minister stated ho desired to intere6t
the lines now in the business to take shares in
the Airway Company, but he thought that the
Canadian National Railway Company should
rotain a majority of the shares.
My honourable friend from Lunenburg (Hon.
Mr. Duif) says he is against state ownership.
Perhaps he is not the only p-erson holding
that view, but I would remind him that in
the past a vast *majority of the people have
voted for state ownership, and we must bow
to the will of that ýmajority. He declares that
the one company wýhich should not have control of this system of transport is the Canadian National Railway Company, because it
has no ýmoney. My honourable friend knows
very well that the Canadian National Railway Company has as ýmuch money as the
Government of Canada may grant it; so when
we say the Canadian National Railway Company wo know we are speaking of our own
concerfi. My honourable friend sh.ould not
wonder as f0 who will be the bankers. We
are the ýowners of tbe Canadian National
Railway system; we are its bankers.
As my right honourable friend from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham) bas said,
transportation by air is a very important development. If now covers the wbole of the
Unit ed States. The Canadian Government
bas agreed with the British Government to
handle by acroplane across Canada the mails
which will be brought across the North
Atlantic by the proposed service now being
organized befween England, Ireland and Canada. Already 87,000,000 bas been spent on
landing fields in this country. The question
is, who sbould control the sysfem. My opinion
is that the one company which should control the systemn is tbe Canadian National
Railway Company; that is, Canada. We have
no idea of the developm-ent which this air
s>ervice will take care of within a few years.
I agree with my right honourable friend
t'rom Eganville that what is now a competitive truck system should have been organized
by the two Canadian railways in ca-ordination with their own transportation facilities.
In 1925 a committee of the Sonate inquired
into the whole sysfemn of transportation. The
inquiry lasted several weeks. A representa-

SENATE

296

tive of one of the American railways operating on the Pacifie coast told the committee
that the directors of his company had establisbed an autobus system extending for 150
miles or more along highways paralleling
their railway, so as to keep his company out
of the red by preventing the loss of passenger traffic to competitive bus companies.
As my right honourable friend bas stated,
our railways should have awakened sooner
to the necessity of retaining their freight
and passenger business by developing truck
and bus services. The present situation is
somewhat similar. Only two weeks ago we
heard evidence before our Railway Committee of the amazing volume of freight and
passengers carried by aeroplane companies in
the northern mining regions. The air transport system across the continent from the
Atlantic to the Pacific is capable of tremendous development and I am sure the Canadian National Railways will stand to gain
by participating in that development.
Our Railway Committee will have the opportunity of hearing the honourable Minister
of Transport. who is responsible for this proposal. Evidently he has not acted with his
eyes shut. This is his statement of personal
experience:
This is a very difficult problei. and before
coming to a final conclusion I think I exhauisted
all available sources of information. I bave
ridden in every type of equipnent used on the
mail routes in the United States; I have diseussed the problem with the heads of all the
successful trans-American comupanies; I have
had the privilege of discussing the probleni
with the General Manager of Imperial Airways
and with officers of the British Air Ministry,
and I have read every report in thi., cornetion that I bave been able to lay m1ylands on.
As a result of all this I have couie to certain
conclusions. The discussion we have had in
the Bouse to-niglt, al of which 1 know bas
been very friendly and offered in an earnest
desire to bring about the beet possible result,
bas brought out at least four different view.s
as to how this work should be undertaken.
After listening to the discussion I an cou'v inced
that this Bill offers the niost practical solution

that eau be suggested. I believe we have safeguarded ourselves at every point.
When the honourable Minister of Transport
appears before our committee we shall receive
first-hand information on the subject-matter
of the Bill.
I move second reading.
Hon. Mr. DUFF:

stand

why ny honourable leader is so desirous
of shutting me off.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It is not a
question of shutting off my honourable frierd.
When I rose I looked around to see if any other
honourable muembers desired to speak, and as
no one apparently desired to do su, I proceeded to close the debate. If my honourable
friend wishes to nake another speech I shall
have to reply to him. and there may be no end
to the discussion.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I do nut object to my
honourable friend replying to me, but certainly I should be given an opportunity to
answier certain statements which bave been
made. I was courteous enough to defer to
him, as he has had far more experience in this
Cliamber than I can yet claim.
My honourable friend's apparent conversion
to public ownership reminds me of Agrippa's
remark to Paul, "Almost thou persuadest me
to become a Christian." A serious principle
is involved. It is all very well for honourable gentlemen to say, "W\e must have
this transportation system in order to compete
with other people." but I would remind them
that we must cut our garment according to
the cloth. If a private company applied to
Parliaiment for a charter to establish a transCanada air survice. I for one should be delighted to vote for it. I object to this measure
in view of the faut that for a good many years
we have had to vote tens of millions of dollars
to met deficits of the Canadian National
Railways, and now by this Bill we are asked to
authorize the company to go still further into
delebt.

I submit that that is not good busi-

nes. My honourable friend from Scarboro
Junction (Hon. Mr. O'Connor) says that be
and four other gentlemen are willing to invest
the $5.000.000 required for this air service. I
never expeut to go up in an aeroplane, for I
am not air-minded. but I agree with him we
are living in progressive times and it is quite
right that we should have the most modern
transportation conveniences.
By the Bill the Canadian National Railwav
Company is autborized to subscribe the
capital to carry on this service. I object to
the principle involved because I am opposed
to Government ownership. I do not believe
that either the Government or the Canadian
National Railway Company could carry on
this enterprise as economically as could a
private company. We know very well what
happened a few days ago, and what happened
then will happen again if this Bill is passed:
the people of Canada will put up the money.
Somaeone has said we have landing fields.
Well. they are open to private enterprise.
Thev were built to give employment tu people

APRIL 5. 1937
who were out of work, and they could be used
by planes whether privately owned or Government owned; so there is nothing in that
argument. The point is that we should flot
laad the Canadian National Railway Company-which means the people of Canadawith any further deht. If private companies
want to undertake this enterprise, let them do
so0under a Government charter. Why should
the taxpayers of Canada assume a further
burden? I say that, we, as the representatives of the people of the country, should
not vote for this Bill, no>r should we agree
to the principle contained in it.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators, I rise to a poin~t of order. Is there to
be a reasonable observance of the rules of
the Senate of Canada, or are determined and
stubborn gentlemen to be permitted to run
riot? The honourable senator from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duif) has spoken once on
this subject. In speaking a second time he
is transgressing the rules. He will have plenty
of opportunity to speak before the Railway
Committee. I submi't that under our ruies
he bas no right to speak a second time.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Replying to the point
of orderThe Hon. the SPEAKER: The honourable
gentleman from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) is quite right. The Hon. Senator Dandurand wss supposýed to have closed the debate. I am sure the honourable senator from
Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duif) has been in publie
life long enough to know the mules even betteT
than your Speaker. His transgression is probably due to the fact that frequently on the
second meading of bills we are somewhat lax
in our observance of the rules. 1 would ask
the honourable gentleman to conclude his
remarks as soon as he possibly can.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: 1 appreciate what has
been said by His Honour -the Speaker. I
rise now on the point of order raised by the
honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Mumdock). I am going to a.sk the honourable gentleman to withdraw the remark he
made about my being stubborn.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I humbly apologize,
and withdraw the remark. We all realize that
my honourable friend is not stubborn.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: 1 suppose my honourable
friend used the words he did. because he was
speaking from bis own viewpoint.
Now, honourable senators, I do net wish
to delay the House any longer. 1 would only
say that during the eighteen months I have
been here I have noticed that other members

have risen to speak even after the leader of
the House bas spoken to close the debate.
1 though!t 1 might have the same privilege.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: You have had.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Do honourahle memhers
want me to go on or not? I may tell them
that I am going to have more to say ahout
this Bill on the third reading.
I will agree with my honourable friend the
leader of the House that the Bill should go to
a committee and be discussed by it. I conclude my remarks by saying that I am
opposed to the Bill, opposed to public ownership, and opposed to the ratepayers of the
country being saddled with another white
elephant.

BUSINESS PROFITS WAR TAX BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 85, an Act to revive
and amend the Business Profits War Tax Act,
1916.
He said: Honoumable senators, the explanation of this Bill, which comes from the other
House, is as follows: The Business Profits War
Tax Act was enacted in 1916 and was in force
in respect of accounting periods ending in the
years 1915 to 1920, both inclusive. By chapter
10 of the Statutes of 1924 it was enacted that
ail taxes, interest and penalties payable undem
the said Act should memain a tax owing to His

SENATE
Majesty until fully paid and satisfied. This
was the situation up to the time when the
Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, came into
force and effect on February 1. 1928, by
proclamation. The effect of the coming into
force of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927,
is set forth in chapter 65 of the Statutes of
1924, being an Act respecting the Revised
Statutes of Canada. The said chapter 65 of

longer having any force or effect. I may say
that there is some doubt whether an act which
is merely described as being " spent" is really
repealed, but my own opinion is that it is repealed by being so described in that column.
Apparently it was the intention of Parliament, at least in 1924, to enact that taxes
which actually fell due between 1915 and 1920
should remain taxes and be paid. I suggest
that it was never contemplated in 1927 that
the mere inclusion of this measure in the
"spent " column meant that a person who
owed taxes due in the period between 1915
and 1920 should not thereafter have to pay
those taxes. This Bill revives the Business
Profits War Tax Act of 1916 in so far as
taxes whichi fell due during the period between
1915 and 1920 are concerned.
There are two other provisions which relate to those parts of the Business Profits War
Tax Act giving a right of appeal to the taxpayer. The procedure for appeal under the
Business Profits War Tax Act is very cumbersome. If a matter is at all complicated, as
somae matter- thal wil have to be dealt with
under the Business Profits War Tax Act, 1916,
may be, appeals will prove very expensive.
The provision in the Business Profits War Tax
Act with reference to appeals is for the appointment of a board of referees. Then there are
appeals from the decision of that board. The
provisions for appeal in the Income War Tax
Act are much more direct and much cheaper,
both for the Crown and for the appellant, and
it was deemed advisable to get rid of this
board of referees provision. The referees, I
might mention, are appointed by the Government. To ceonduet an appeal under those provisions -the Government bas first to appoint a
board of referees, who will have to be paid,
and they would have to select, I suppose,
counsel, who might work for months in conducting the appeal, only to find at the end
that there would be another appeal. So this
Bill substitutes the appeal procedure of the
Income War Tax Act for the appeal procedure in the Business Profits War Tax Act.
These are the reasons whtv this Bill to
revive and amend the Business Profits War
Tax Act is introduced. It gives the Government the right to claim whatever it believes is
due from defaulters between 1915 and 1920, and
to deal with any false statements made by
those reporting to the Government.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: May I ask the honourable gentleman whether this Bill is going to
Committee of the Whole or to a select connittee?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I had thought we
could give it third reading. I have the statement of the Law Clerk of the Senate that

CANADA-URUGUAY
TRADE
AGREEMENT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 86, an Act respecting
a certain Trade Agreemnent between Canada
and Uruguay.
He said: Honourable senators, the object of
this Bill is the ratification of a trade a.greement signed in August of last year between
Canada and Uruguay. The agreement is for
a term of three years, and unless six months'
nýotice is given bef.ore the termination: of the
tbree-year period it will continue in force
until six months' notice is given soýme tirne
thereafter.
The agreement provides for mutual mostfavoured-nation treatment with respect to
tariffs which, by the way, are of no benefit to
Canada, as I shahl explain. It also provides
that there shahl be no discrimination so far
as the application of exchange ýcontrol or the
imposition of quotas is concerned.
Preferences to other parts of the Empire are excluded
from the operation of the agreement, together
with any preferences that may be given by
Uruguay to neighbouring countries such as
Bolivia. Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina.
The trade with Uruguay is quite small.
Canada's sales to that country in the year
ended Match 31, 1936, were $368,000, while our
purclruses from her amnounted to $206.000. Our
echief exports are botb free and dutiable. The
important free exports are newsprint and farm
implements. though from the latter should be
excepted ploughs. Our dutiable exports are
rubber boots and shoes, tires and tubes, automobiles and sewing machines. together with
some otber smaîl items. The benefits that
will accrue to Canada are not. as I intimated
previously. by way of tariff concessions, but
this agreement accomplishes the removal of
wbat I may caîl a potential menace so far as
A
our treatment by Uruguay is concerned.
few years ago the Parhiament of Uruguay
empowered the Government of that country
to impose a 50 per cent increase in duty on
the countries which did not accord ber most-

favoured-nation treatment. That bas neyer
been applied against Canada, tbough it bas
been applied against some other countries
and there was always the possibility that it
might be applied to Canada. By this agreemeut that mîenace is remoived. Uruguay bas

control, and, as 1 mentioned previously, she

receive treatment relatively equal to that
accorded any other country.
The benefits that accrue to Uruguay are
that sbe obtains most-favoured-nation treatment as far as our tariff is concerned. After
tbe provisional agreement was signed last
August she immediately obtained tbe benefits
of our intermediate tariff. By our grant of
most-favoured-nation treatment she gets in
addition a.ny benefits tbat may accrue by
reason of tbe trade agreements that have been
made witb the United States. France and
Poland.

He said: Honourable senators, tbe purpose

difficulty to-day is that
separate appropriations
and stores under each
be carried as separate

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That is in the
one department?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes. The only
means by which stores can be moved
from one appropriation to another is the process of sale, which involves extensive bookkeeping. The result is that we have sixty
store depots from coast to coast-as many as
three depots. and in one instance four being
in the same city-and in these depots are five
or six separate compartments. Goods purchased must be placed in one compartment,
and used in that compartment under the
appropriation. and cannot quickly be transferred to any other compartment where the
same goods are required.
The department's annual purchases of
stores are about $3.000,000 and our stocks
to-day are $1,500,000, which of course is an
absurd figure. The Minister states he has
gone into the matter in an effort to have the
stocks reduced, and it has been explained to
hii that it is impossible te reduce them
without legislation of this kind to authorize
combining them for the various services.
The motion was agreed te, and the Bill was
read the second time.

According to
the Law Clerk, a number of amendments are

creditors. John J. Campbell made no application to the board for a hearing, because
more than twelve months before that date
he got a Joan from the Farm Loan Board
and paid all bis creditors in full. Consequently neither he nor any of bis former
creditors paid any attention to the letters
they got from the Registrar. This would
look like a very keen desire on the part of
an organization to drum up business and get
I am told that
work that pays so well.
Jerome McEachren's case had been dýisposed
of by the previous Board of Review, under
the chairmanship of Judge Arsenault, and no
one can tell why it was opened again. Neither
Russell Peters nor any of bis creditors attended court, because, J am informed, Mr.
Peters made no application to the Board of
Review, or any official thereof, and wanted
no interference in bis affairs. This trip to
Souris would cost the taxpayers of Canada
at least $50 and expenses, and that seems
to be the only reason it was undertaken.
J have not said anything yet about the
tremendous cost of the administration of this
Act. J have dwelt upon features which appeared to me to be of far greater importance.
About a week ago I read in one of the
Charlottetown newspapers an article which
seemed to attempt to excuse or palliate the
Prince Edward Island racket by saying that
we were not worse than, if as bad as, some
of the other provinces. We were compared
with Nova Scotia. where the average cost per
case was shown to be $159.27 while the
average cost per case on the Island was
$55.09. Every accountant knows that percentages can be made to prove almost anything if some of the factors in connection
with the problems are withheld. Let us try
to include all the factors. Nova Scotia is,
I suppose, four or five times as large as the
Island, and has-I am speaking from memory-four times the population. While only
113 cases were heard in Nova Scotia, 927
cases were heard on the Island. Evidently
the Act was either greatly under-adminis.tered in Nova Scotia or tremendously overadministered in Prince Edward Island. Furthermore, where the cases are few and the
distances to be travelled are great, the cost
per case must necessarily be much larger than
where the cases are numerous and the distances are short. If, for instance, only thirteen cases had been heard in Nova Scotia,
the cost per case would be enormously enhanced. Let us compare the cost of administering the Act on Prince Edward Island
with the cost of administering it in the whole
of Canada, on a per capita basis. This
would not be unfair to the Island, province,
I tbink, for the reasons already stated. The
cost of administering the Act on Prince

Edward Island amounted to $51,071.04. If the
same cost per capita had been maintained all
over the Dominion it would have amounted
to more than six millions of dollars, whereas
it really amounted to only $1,424.772.69. I
think the administrators in the other provinces were well paid; in fact, I think some
of them were overpaid; but I leave that to
honourable senators from the other provinces,
if ýthey wish to look into the matter. This
comparison, I fear, shows not only that a
great many things were wrong with the administration of the Act on Prince Edward
Island, but also that the bead office here in
Ottawa had lest control of the situation on
the Island, and had failed to keep any check
on the expenditure there, or perhaps on anything else.
I have already stated that I consider the
excessive expenditure in connection with the
administration of the Act on Prince Edward
Island the least serious part of the business.
There are in this House many lawyers eminent
in the profession. The two leaders of this
House are outstanding men in law and business. I ask them in all seriousness to tell me
if in their opinion it is possible for a judge
of the Supreme Court in bis right senses to
deliver such judgments as Judge Saunders
bas delivered, or bas allowed to be delivered,
in connection with the working of the Farmers'
Creditors Arraneement Act in Prince Edward
I assume, and I think I have a
Island.
right to assume, that when Judge Saunders
was appointed to the Bench he had a reasonable working knowledge of law and possessed
a fair knowledge of business and a fair share
of common sense. If be had these qualifications at that time, I am compelled to assume
that he bas lest them and is no longer able
to do bis work as a judge. This is a serious
state of affairs and must be properly looked
into.
I feel conHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
strained to dissent from an expression of
opinion as to the fitness of a judge to act as

is that he is assailed in bis capacity as

honourable senator (Hon. Mr. Hughes) is on
somewhat delicate ground. I do net know
whether the gentleman referred to is a judge
of the County Court or of the Superior
Court.

if that makes any difference.

Hon. Mr. HARDY: Restrict it to the board
and you can give all you want, I think.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I submit to this
House thit it will never do to let the people
lose confidence in the integrity and ability of
our courts. Tiat is the serions part of the
matter. I read a few days ago in one of the
newspapers that the Law Society of New
Brunswick had sent a petition to the Justice
Department asking for the removal of one of
the judges in that province because of physical
defects. These things were not the judge's
fault.
Now I make a suggestion. As so many of
the Ministers are leaving for the Coronation,
1 do not think a proper investigation can be
held immediately; but one should be held;
therefore I suggest that the administration of
the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act on
Prince Edward Island be suspended for a few
months. or until the Department of Finance,
the Department of Justice, or perhaps the
whole Government, can look into the entire
situation and deal with it as it should be
dealt with. Thank you, honourable senators.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members. the last thing I want to
do is to delay the House, but I may be
engaged elsewhere when the matter cornes
up again. I have received four or five communintions on this subject. There seems to
be no special reason wbv anyone should
write to me.
While these communications
<lo not confirm the detail which the bonourable mîenber has given. they complain most
bitterly of the administration of the Act in
tho Iand. Had it not been for the source
of one of these communications I should
have becn disposed to think they came from
crank-. Knowing the source of one of them,
I know they do not. I am sure that the
Minister of Finance, who bas charge of the
administration of the Act. would not tolerate
this kind of thing at all if he were convinced
it wa- occurring. I am afraid it is. I am
afraid the statement of the honourable member fron
ing's (Hon. Mr. Hughes) is only
.oo true.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators. I am informed now for the first
tine of the statement we have just heard.
I had seen a list of members or officials of
the board in Prince Edward Island, but did
nut know what would be the nature of the
criticisnm to be made. All I can say is that
I will draw the attention of the Min.ister who
presides over the department to the statement that has just been made.
H1on. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. J. E. SINCLAIR: Honourable members of the Senate, I do not think it is necessary to have this discussion of the administration of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act in Prince Edward Island. Though
I have never had anything to do with that
Act, I have been in touch with it through
what I have heard from those appearing as
creditors or debtors, and those who have
applied for consideration. I have listened attentively to the statement of the honourable
senator from King's (Hon. Mr. Hughes).
I know nothing about the cases he mentions,
except that they are all in his own locality,
and that he tells us he was interested in some
of them. I know an effort was made a short
time ago in Charlottetown, where the farmers
hold their annual meetings in the month of
FebruaryHon. Mr. HUGHES: The month of March.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I think it was the
last of February. An effort was made to
secure an expression of opinion with regard to
the result of the Act, and that expression was
entirely in favour of it.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I read the resolution
passed by the farmers, and I am entirely in
accord with it. It says "if properly administ ered."
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: The whole criticism
seenis to relate to the administration of the
Act. I have huard of the complaints referred to by the honourable senator from
King's, but nevitieless I think the Act is
performing a good service in Prince Edward
Island.
I <lo not think it is wise to suspend the
Act, as the honourable gentleman lias suggested. If the cases nentioned have been the
subject of such extreme treatment as he intimates, theire is a remedy other than to bring
the matter up like this, at the tail end of
the session. It is quite open for the honourable ilimber to ask for a committee of this
House at a time when all these cases can
be examined into. They are all on record
in the office of the Superintendent of the
Farmiers' Creditors Arrangement Act; every
detail of each case is on record in the Department of Finance. If there are reports
of abuses, it is within our power to examine
into thom in a careful and deliberate way
and find out whether or not they are correct.
So far as I am concerned, there are severaI
reasons why I would refuse to accept any
statement as to whether they are right or
wrong. until there was an investigation of that
kind in regard to them. I know the learned
judge who is at the head of the Board of

APRIL 6, 1937
Review in Prince Edward Island at the present
time, Mr. Justice Saunders, and I knew the
judge who preceded him and who voluntarily
resigned his position in 1935. I do not think
it lies in the mouth of any member of Parliament or of any other person to say anything
disrespectful of either of these gentlemen,
who have given fair and honest service.
There was tabled in this House a few days
ago a return showing the cost of administering
the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act,
which cost is borne by the Government. As
honourable members know, the year before
this measure became law we passed the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act, which
made it possible for companies and business
houses to adjust their debts without having
their assets sold and business wound up. The
Government did not assume the cost of
administering that Act. I think Parliament
was wise, though, in deciding that the Government should bear expenses connected with
operations of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, extending similar benefits to
farmers. Honourable members will readily
recall the hearings before our Banking and
Representatives of
Commerce Committee.
mortgage companies, loan companies and other
institutions throughout Canada were in favour
of the measure.
I believe the Act has worked out well.
It may be that among all the cases handled
there are a few in connection with which our
judgment would differ from that of the Board
of Review; but as to each such case there
would be simply an honest difference of
opinion. I feel that the Board of Review in
Prince Edward Island lias given its best
judgment in all the cases which have corne
before it, and that there are very few in which
its action is subject to criticism by those
conversant with the facts.
My honourable friend from King's (Hon.
Mr. Hughes) made a comparison showing
per capita costs of the administration in
Prince Edward Island and other parts of the
Dominion. That is not a fair basis of comparison for my province, which is largely
agricultural. I should say that our industrial
or urban population down there is only about
15,000 out of the total of 90,000. Honourable
members can see that in these circumstances
it is hardly fair to compare costs on a per
capita basis with those of other provinces,
where the percentage of industrial population
is much higher, running in some cases to 50
per cent.
Official receivers, to whom reference has
been made, were originally paid a salary.
In January, 1936, the Department of Finance
changed that system and provided for their
payment by fees. An official receiver gets

305

$20 for each case coming before him in which
he formulates a proposal and makes a settle
ment with the creditor. If he is not able to
make a settlement and the case goes before
the Board of Review, he is paid only $15.
That change in the method of remuneration
has meant a saving to the Government of
$258.000, and I think the administration of the
Act is just as effective as when official receivers were paid salaries.
I have before me a lot of details, but I will
touch upon only a few of them. The House
may be interested to know that in the two
years since the Act went into force, 3,955
farmers in Prince Edward Island interviewed
official receivers and applied for some adjustment in their financial affairs. Out of this
number of applications only 901 proposals
were formulated. Voluntary settlements were
effected through the instrumentality of official
receivers in 217 cases. Cases referred to the
Board of Review totalled 508, of which 458
have been disposed of, leaving 50 still to
be heard as at the loth' of February this year.
In addition, official receivers effected 190 settlements without formulating any proposal
between farmers and creditors. Honourable
members will sec from these figures that
while a comparatively large number of farmers applied for some adjustment, not onefourth of them actually went forward with
proposals.
Since the Act cannot apply to any debt
contracted after May, 1935, except with the
express consent of the creditor, it seems
clear that if present conditions continue this
legislation will automatically be resorted to
less and less as time goes on. Applications
for adjustment in Prince Edward Island
averaged about 40 a month in the early part
of last year, but, as there was a good crop,
that average declined considerably before the
year was over. In October there were about
40 applications, but in November there were
only 33. and in December the number fell
to 28. The figure for January of this year
was even lower, and in February only 16
applications were made to official receivers.
I do not sec that there is anything to be
gained by making rash statements in regard
to administration of this Act. We cannot
expect the administration to be perfect, but
I am satisfied that in Prince Edward Island
it is as nearly perfect as it is in any other
part of Canada. I am sure that my honourable friend who bas some views to air in
connection with this matter (Hon. M.r.
MacArthur) would find, if the records and
officials were examined before a committee of
this House. that there is no justification for
making such ado about the administration of
the Act in Prince Edward Island.

CUSTOMS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDIIAND moved the
second reading of Bill 84, an Act to amend
the Customs Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this Bill
proposes a certain number of amendments to

in detail, for tiey will be dealt with separately
in committee.
I would now simply draw
attention to clause 3, which provides that
certain values for duty shall be deesned to
have been lawfully fixed. The clause reads
as follows:
3. The said Act is further aniended by inserting the folloing section imiiiediately after
section forty-three thereof:
43A. (1) All values for duty heretofore fixed

(3)

Nothing

in this section shall affect

any

legal proreedings b)yvway of petition of right in
respect of whici a fiat of the Governor General
iad been granted on or before the first day of
October, 1936.
I will present to the Housse, as a brief, a
statement made by the Minister of National
Revenue, Hon. 1\r. Ilsley.
Shortly before Great Britain went off the
gold standard our currency was at a discount
as compared with United States currency,
and certain valies for duty purposes of fruits
and vegetables were fixed under section 43.
The Commissioner of Customs of that time
interpreted the order of the Minister as fixing
the values in United States rather than in
Canadian currency. and gave directions accordingly to the collectors. The result was
that more dumping duty was collected than
would have been collected had the orders of
the Minister been intepreted as referring to
Canadian currency, and the amounts of duty
that were calculated on that basis were taken
in the period between November, 1931. and
May or June, 1932. Those dumping duties
are the basis of a petition of right which
was filed in 1936. A fiat has been granted and
the case is pending in the Exchequer Court
at the present time. That is one irregularity
which is complained of by a certain number
of exporters. Certain other irregularities or
alleged irrcgularities in the imposition of these
dumping duties are complained of. They are
these:
First. that values were fixed without authorization by -the Governor in Cosuncil, the contention being that once a value las been
fixed the authority is exhausted. The view of
the department is that since the original Orders
in Council authorizing the Minister to fix
values were never cancelled, they were available each season as occasion arose. Honourable members will notice that this is a technical question bearing on procedure.
The second complaint is that the Orders in
Council authorizing the fixation of values were
not published in the Canada Gazette as required by statute. The department, answers
that all such Orders in Council were published in the Canarla Gazette as required. This
again is a techit al point covering questions
of procedure.
The tiird complaint is that the values fixed
were not published in the Canada Gazette as
required by statute. The department answers
that all values fixed were published in the
Canada Gazette, but were not in all cases
published in the next following issue. Again
this is a technical point.
The fourth complaint is that no authority
existed for a ruling to the effect that values
were fixed ; tes
ss of the currency of the

APRIL 6, 1937
country of expert. The department answers
that this was a ruling of the Commissioner
of Customs issued when the Canadian dollar
became depreciated as compared with the
United States dollar. As I have stated, that
covers the period from November, 1931, to June,
1932. I may add that the ruling, which under
the statute itself was arbitrary, could have
effected the same result by increasing the
valuation under Canadian currency, inasmuch
as it was for the Commissioner or the Minister to decide that valuation, arbitrarily, if
you will.
The fifth complaint is that the fixing of
values at an advance on the invoice value
does not constitute a fixation as contemplated
by section 43 of the Customs Act. The department answers that this method of fixing
values was adopted in 1932, was agreed upon
by the Canadian Fruit and Vegetable Jobbers' Association and the Canadian Horticultural Council, and is still being used.
The sixth complaint is that no authority
exists for the inclusion of the weight of the
container in computing values fixed under
section 43 of the Customs Act. The department answers that this is in line with the
tariff revisions requiring the weight of the
packages to be included in the weight for
duty, and was adopted on the recommendation of the Canadian Fruit and Vegetable
Jobbers' Association.
The seventh complaint is that no authority
exists for computing fixed values on railway
billing weights. The department answers that
this was a ruling issued in 1932 to promote
uniformity in treatment of fruit and vegetables
at different ports and was made at the request
of the Canadian Fruit and Vegetable Jobbers'
Association.
The eighth complaint is that certain valuations which were stated to be applicable "all
year" should have been interpreted to mean
until the end of the calendar year, rather
than all year around as interpreted by the department. The department answers that it
has consistently interpreted this phrase to mean
all year around and every year until otherwise ordered, as distinct from seasonal or
limited periods during which certain commodities are available.
The ninth complaint is that certain bulletins setting forth fixed valuations failed to
exempt shipments purchased and in transit
to Canada at the time the bulletins were
issued, 'though such shipments had been
exempted on other occasions. The department answers that this was merely a change
in the method of application of the fixed valuations and was in accord with the policy
existing at that time.
31117-20½

The Minister then continues his explanation:
Those are the grounds that are set out, and
many of them are quito technical. The point I
wish to bring to your attention is this. The importers knew at a very early stage what view
the department took of the meaning of these
Orders in Couneil and of the orders the Minister made under the Orders in Couneil, and
governed themselves accordingly. Knowing the
practice of the department and the view it took
of what the proper practice was, nevertheless
the importers placed their orders for a period
of years-it has been five or six years-and paid
the dumping duties required by the department.
Recently certain enterprising persons have
been promoting the filing of claims with the
Claims
Department of National Revenue.
amounting to over $600,000 have already been
filed, and I am advised by my officers that the
likelihood is that with respect to fruits and
vegetables alone the claims against the department will run to $2,000,000 or more.
The contention on which these claims are
based is that when a man pays duties illegally
he is entitled to a return of them, on grounds
of equity and fairness. Such is not the case
here, because the persons who have actually
paid the duties will not get them back; the
people who will benefit are the promoters of
claims and others who are having a large
number of claims filed with the department.
We have a stack of them already. It means
that the treasury will lose two or three million
dollars, and the persons who paid enhanced
prices for goods as a result of the dumping
duty will get no benefit whatever.
On this account I submit that Parliament
should ratify the imposition of these duties.
In my opinion that is the fair thing to do in
all the circumstances. I do not agree that this
is confiscatory legislation or legislation of that
type. It is more in the class of legislation
which in Nova Scotia is passed every year
for the ratification of assessments. I understand also that in Ontario years ago, though
perhaps not now, legislation was passed every
year ratifying tax sales.
The administration of these sections is a
diffBeult matter at best. The Departmnent of
,Justice was consulted from time to time, as
were the departmental solicitors. It may be
that that when the sections and the numerous
bulletins are examined with a microscope some
legal ground may be found for the return of
these duties; I do not know. Two petitions
of right have already been filed, and they are
exempted because we do not think we should
issue a fiat to enable petitioners to go into
court and then legislate them out of court.
But for those who have not filed a petition of
right I submit that the action of the department should be ratified.
Now, I draw the attention of honourable
members to the fact that these complaints
with respect to rulings of the department
between November, 1931, and June, 1932,
should have reached the department within
a reasonable time, yet they were not sent in
until 1936. If they had covered only the
department's interpretation as to the currency
which should have been used in valuing the
goods imported. they could have been discussed, and any injury to the importers, if

ffl

pro e-d, eould have been rectified. Instead,
we have to-day one person attacking- the
whole administration of the department on
this; score fromn November. 1931. to the presenit
time. H1e has aronsed and organized. those
who imported goods during that period to
join in what may fairly be termed a most
dangerous raid upon the federal t reasury.
Numierouýs telegrams have been received. ail
evidenrly prompted by the samne person, who
lias notified those importers that the prospect
of colleeting, millions of dollar.s frein the
Goverromeot may vanish if this Bill is passed.
H1e has been orgaoizing a esystenmatie assanît

partieulars.
Hon. -Mr. LYNCH-STAIJNTON: Most of
it?
Hou. .JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members. I do not say I shall vote against the
Bill, but I doubt whether, under section 43
ofthe Cus~toms Act, the department had any
right to lev ' those duities against goods comnîog fromn the United States at that time,
l)eratise the Act provided that thcties could
be loied against: a country with a depreeiated cirrence. This did not apply to countriecs with appreciateti dnrrency.
But aside fromn that altogethmer. and leaving
out of the t)icture for a mnoment what the
honourable leader hias said. 1 snbmit that
tbis Bill does mnch more than he lias stated.
It îurports to ratify' and confirm what officiaIs
of the tlepartinent have done for the last fie
and a haîf years. Il goes further: it provides
what i0 future thov mnax dIo withoiit parliamentary sanction.
Trne. in the naaiority of cases the department had authority 10 colleet the duties if
its officials bath complied with the Ctustoms
Act. which reqnires the Minister-not the

superîntendent. butt the Minister-to issue the

countries, but in my judgment tbat autbority
does not apply at ail to importations from
appreciated currency countries. In many cases
tbe Minister did not make tbe order-in fact
neyer knew anything about it; the superintendent or thc assistant superintendent of
customs, or some other official, assumed that
power.
A number of orders were issued after duty
had been paid and tbe purchaser had sold
the gnods and been paid for them; then tbe
department levied furtber duties on the
strengtb of those orders.
That is tbe reýal
cmux of the situation. If there is one case
in that class it should be protected.
The McCart case bas been pending since
February, 1936.
The department promised
to proceed in May, but no move was made
until October: and thougb certain documents
were required in November, the department
did not produce them until March. From
this it would appear that tbe department
feels it bas no defence.
I recaîl a. case in
Winnipeg. An automobile company imported
gonds, cleared them tbrough tbe customs, and
so]d them. Later the department notified the
company that bigber duties were payable, and
insisted on payment.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Why not?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Tben wby flot the other
way?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.
But this class of
dlaims refers only to fruit and vegetables.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Oh, no, it does not. It
refers to everything.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I say the dlaims
madle are in respect of fruit and vegetables.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. The reasOn is that
the fruit and vegetables came largely from the
United States, and that country baving an
appreciated currency, the-re was no authority
under section 43 to increase dumping duties.
I submit there never was any authority under
the Act to inecase dumping duties against
appreciated currency countries; the section
applies onlv to depreciated currency countries.
If this Bill dealt only with that phase,
and the honourable leader would submit to
us the cases învolved, I would vote for its
enactmaent. But the Bill goes further.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: What clause is that?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Clause 3. The whole
basis of the ActHon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
What
clause ?

309

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Clause 3. I submit that
what we ought to do with this section is to
send it to committee and limit the retroactive
features to cases in respect of which the
section gave autbority to impose the duty
and there were only technica! defects. If I
arn correct in my contention that section 43
applied only to countries with depýreciated
currency, and there was no rigbt to impose
the duty, we sbould not now give such a
rîght; or if we want to go so far, the provision
should apply only to cases where the money
was paid without protest at the time. In any
event we should make it clear that the Bill
applies only to what has been done in the
past and flot to wh-at will be done in future.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Whether there was
protest or not, what difference does it make?

Hon. Mr. HAIG: There is a good deal to
be said for what the honourable leader of
the Government bas stated. If 1 were a
produce dealer and had paid a duty of 50 per
cent instead of 30 per cent, and had recovered
the difference in selling the goods, I do not
think I sbould be allowed to get any money
back. In other words, the tecbnical mistakes
can .be cured. During my experience in the
Legisiature of Manitoba we used to bave to
ratify every year what municipal clerks had
done in the matter of tax sales. If a municipal
clerk had published notice in the Gazette
only tbree times instead of four, we had to
ratify what liad been done. I arn willing that
wc should ratify taxes that were properly
paid. but I arn not willing that we should
ratify a tix for whicb there was no legal
authoiization in tbe first place. I do not
w,,ant it to be possible in the future for the
Commissjoner ni Assistant Commissioner to
send out a notice whieh will becomie law.
Tliat should flot bc possible. I submnit that
the Bill should go to committee so that
representations may be heard and these
matters may be thresbied out.
Hun. F. P. QUINN. Hoîiouable mciîbers,
tbere appears to be considerable opposition
to the Bill now before us. Since cnming into
this Chamber I have received a teiegrani
from Halifax from a gentleman wbo conducts
a large importing and wbolesale produce
business. It says:
Bill 84 Customs amendmient if passed will
cost us heavily. AIl Maritime wholesale fruit
firrns one hundred per cent against sucb legislation as propose(l. Our contention is if necessary to pass Bill that the retroactive feature
be deleted. Exclbequer Court already decided
in our favour, therefore amendment if passed
will usurp court's functions.
That is from C. H. Gorham, a prominent
produce merchant of Halifax.

centrated ail their activities on the soul in
order to get a living by it. It is oniy rigbt
that agriculture should bave preceded mining,
and that the development of mining sbould
bave come alan after that of the forests.
In 18S7, nur minerai production amounted
to $10,321,331; in 1893, $20,035,082; in 1900,
364,420,877; in 1910. $105.040.958.
In 1936,
according to the Minister of Finance, "The
value of our production reached the imposing
figure of over $360,000,000. At current production leveIs our mines are turning out weaith
at the rate of a million dollars a day."
It is extremely comforting to note this
movement of labour towards7 our mining
industrv. wbere remuneratîve employment is
to be found in the extraction of our minerai
produets. se pientiful in this Dominion.
In 1936 and 1937 the lionourable the Minister
of Mines gave a series of talks on the Canadian mining industry and
its national
importance.
is objeet was to give not oniy
to, the people of Canada, but alan to, other
countries, an outline of the extent, diversity
and value of this industry. We trust, as he
does. that these talks will be instructive and
i.seful for those who wish to become more
familiar with one of our Canadian industries
wbose prospects are most promising.
The Canadian people may well ýbe proud
of the place that their land holds among metal
producing countries. Canada comes first in
the production of nickel and platinum metals;
second in the production of zinc; third in
the production of gold, copper and silver;and fourth in the production of iead. Although
that is a remarkabie achievement for a nation
of eleven million people, it is but the forerunner of what is in store for us.
At the beginning of this century, settiement
wsas limited to the confines of agricultural
lands. but as mines were being developed
there'started a movement northwards whieh
still goes on. The mining enthusiasts do not
:seem to realize the importance of organizing
also on the spot production centres for those
commodities of which acekers of precious
metals are in need. Important as it is to
extract the wealth of the subsoil, let us not
be unmindful of the wealth which lies on the
surface, and wbich brought a fortune to the
sons of Lafontaine's ploughman. By developing the lands adjacent to the mining centres
of Abitibi and Timiskaming, our settlers, as
the years pass on, would secure a fairly
comfortable ife, and ensure their own happiness. Such a policy, if systematicaily and
firmaly administered, would enable us to keep
-within our country a large portion of the
money that is spent in payment for the
labour and supplies that are necessary to the

311

mining industry. The honourable, the Minister
of Mines stated on April 24, 1936, that these
expenditures throughout
Canada in 1935
amouinted to probably $180,000,000. '1 think we
may say, without exaggeration, that about
$10,000,000 are being spent earh year in
Abitibi and Timaiskaming. Our settiers wouid
therefore find a market for their products
that would really be worth while.
Men of energy and ability undertook, in
grave circumastances, to supply the Canadian
people with railways wbich actually link
together the various provinces of Confederation. The railroads were the pioneer institutions which opencd up our great domains;
they have strengthened the ties binding the
interests of each province wjth those of the
othber provinces, and they have Iargely made for
the development of our trade. The mining
industrv i.s a source of revenue for our railways. 'Througbout Canada it supplies tbem
witb a profitable traffic, and with the rapid
developînent of our mines we may hope for a
steady decrease of our railway deficits. Let
me quote some of the statements made by
the honourable Minister of Mines:
We may reasonably hope to recover from
our financial difficulties by deveioping our
mining industry.
Sbouid we develop our minerai resources to
the fuliest extent during the next five years,
then we shall have solved our railway problem.
The mining industry is one of the most
important hiîman activities in this country.
Besides the number of men directly empioyed
hy it, this industry requires many thousands
more to supply its needs. Here is what the
honourable Minister of Mines said on February 28. 1936:
Now thinl, of the empioyment that we could
provide for a certain number of young men
who have been staying for some years past
at the relief camps, if we doubied our present
production. Every increase in the production
of mninerai weaith heips to solve our railway
and unemployment prohlems, and it can bring
about the prosperity which we' ail hope for.
I have great faith in Canada's future and 1
believe that the Canadian people are capable
of. taking the means of deveioping the immense
minerai resources which lie beneath our soul.
Canada needs competent tecbnical men.

furnisbing to a whole population of industrious
fishermen sufficient income to improve the
general situation of the entire district. The
lumber industry, formerly one of the sources
of wealth of the Gaspé Peninsula, is still
capable of feeding paper milîs. The cattleraising industry, still in the embryo stage,
could be developed to, a point wbere foreigu
markets would vie with one another for its
products. The soil of the peninsula, highly
fertile and favoured by an ideal climate,
would make it possible for a large farming
population to live from the produce of the
land and of the sea, while supplying the
markets wbich the development of industry
would create. And what of the subsoil? Its
true value is not yet known, but the estimates
of geologists lead us to, believe that it will
probably become an important competitor
of the other mining regions of the world.
Its industrial and agricultural development
assured, its mining development in prospect,
such is what the Gaspé Peninsula eau offer
to those who will seek there an improvement
in their conditions of living.
I wish to speak more particularly of the
developmeut of the miuing industry in the
Gaspé Peninsula. Iu 1854 Sir William Logan
discovered oil lands from the basin of the
York river to the vicinity of Point St. Peter.
More recent investigations seem to show that
the oil wells exteud from Gaspé Bay to the
Matapedia valley. MineraIs have been found
in great number tbrougbout tbe peninsula.
Gold and silver ore have been discovered
aloug the York river, at Marsouin and at
Cross Point. In recent years prospecting bas
heeri carried ou, mainly for zinc and lead,
along the Berry Brook, a tributary of the
Grand Cascapedia river. There is an abundance
of granite suitable for construction work. I
suggest that the federal and provincial governmeuts should co-operate in the scientiflo research necessary for the development of the
mineraI resources of the Gaspé Peninsula.
It would be advisahle to undertake more
tborough surveys and prospecting on a large
scale. On the 3rd of March last the Premier
of Quehec said:
We will take measures to open up through
the Gaspé Peninsula a road connecting the
niorth and south shores.
As the bonourable member for MataneMatapedia said the other day:
The Gaspé peninsula lacks the necessary
facilities for the development of its natural

developmnent cannot be carried on to-day, on
account of the many difficulties to be overcome
in reaching the centre of the peninsula. Owing
to the absence of ail transportation facilities,
prospectors have to carry their equipment and
food on their backs through narrow trails.

313

Nowhere else could the State's intervention
be more frujtful.
The construction of a railroad over the
great in]and plateau of Gaspé has been
planned for mnany years. Why bas it flot
heen carried out? The serjous state of unemployment which bas lasted so long in that
region, where fifty new parishes could be
establîshed, seems to have been forgotten.
As was said in another place. the vast region
of Gaspé awaits only the building of a railway
to receive our surplus population and absorb
the youth of our country, who would find
there a splendid field of action in which to
display their energy and put to useful work
their strong arms which have too long
remained idle.
The construction of a railway through the
Gaspé Peninsula would open up a source of
wealth the importance of which it is as yet
impossible to foresee. In the ever.t of our
wishes being fulfilled by the authotities. new
parishes will be established in the Gaspé
Peninsula, land settiement and agriculture
will prosper, lumbering and mining development will become possible snd our young
people will be in a position to live under
normal conditions.
Let my fellow-citizens of the province oÇ
Quebec take a wise interest in the development of our natural resources.
Let our younger French Canadians seek

Jack, to fulfil that destiny which Providence
bas foreordaîned for them in that province.
On the whole, our province is satisflcd to
live under the British flag. However, there
are nowadays young men who contend that
Confederation bas not fulfilled oui' expectations. A few of them even go so far as to
suggest the repeal of the federative covenant,
and they advocate the establishment of a
kind of new republic on the shores of the
St. Lawrence. In my humble opinion, the
unrest among our young French Canadians
does not arise from the Constitution, but is
due to the men who are governing the
country.
1 appeal to those men who are not of my
race and speech. In the administration of the
important Department of Mines, I entreat
the honourable Minister not to forget FrenchLet us give the

APRIL 6. 1937
When agriculture languishes industrial development will necessarily be hindered. History reveals that agriculture has always been
the foundation of every great country, whilst
the drift of population away from the everlasting land to urban centres has always
been coincident with national decay. This is
fundamental.
It therefore follows that the
primary duty of government is to examine
the conditions under which the tillers of the
soil live and work. and then by wise legislation it should seek to promote the greatest
possible prosperity for our primary producers,
and thus ensure the welfare of the country
at large.
I think investigation would disclose that
lack of leadership amongst farmers, indifference towards agricultural education, absence
of co-operative marketing, mass production
in industry and the disproportion between the
long hours of the farmer's labour and the
prices received by bim for his products have
been the principal obstacles to the advancement of agriculture. And undoubtedly, honourable members, there have been obstacles.
Some farmers have failed because they did
not have the necessary capital to finance
their crops. Because our farmers are as a
class silent, not given to noisy agitation,
they may appear to be prosperous, and I fear
that a prosperity more apparent than real
tends to excite general jealousy.
Agriculture, as we are told, is the mainstay
of the social and economie life of Canada.
It would therefore seem only reasonable that
it should receive more attention on the part
of both federal and provincial governments.
I am convinced that if we wish agriculture
to endure, we must so adjust it to economic
conditions that those engaged in it may live,
if not prosper. We must try to find purchasing power for them by finding and retaining markets, by eliminating the too great
difference between production costs and selling
prices, and by taking the necessary measures
to prevent industrial mass production from
ruining the farmers' markets. We must place
at the disposal of those in need effectual
credits. so that small farmers may finance
their crops without paying prohibitive rates
of interest. For the attainment of this end
it may become necessary to help both the
borrower and the lender. If, honourable members, we succeed to even a small extent in
stimulating dormant agriculture, we shall again
set in motion the wheels of some industries
that have been inactive for years through
lack of sufficient demand for their commodities.
It is my considered view that the land
should revert to the unemployed. They, accustomed by force of circumstances to live

frugally. would not only be able to maintain themselves without direct relief, but
would be able to make a fair living and at
the same time improve the land entrusted
to their care.
And may I say in conclusion: (Translation)
Instead of voting thousands of dollars for the
purpose of temporarily parrying the depression,
would it not be better to use part of this
money in opening new lands to settlement, so
as to provide homes for these people who wish
to go back to the land and thus avoid unemployment? Honourable senators, if the problem
of agriculture is the basic problem of mankind,
and if, as has been said, a rural home is the
best environment for the uplift of the people's
souls, I have no hesitation in saying that there
is no nobler task to which one could devote
one's life.
Let us make possible the rehabilitation of
our thousands of vacant farms, let us make
agriculture prosperous, let us put opportunities
for settlement within the reach of farmers'
sons and of those to whom farming is attractive, thereby laying the groundwork for the
solution of the great unemployment problem.
Then the Canadian farmer, satisfied with his
lot, will continue to till the land in the best
interests of our country.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM presented the
report of the Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours on Bill 12. an
Act to provide for the revision of the
accounting set-up of the Canadian National
Railway System, and moved concurrence
therein.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I think it is perhaps better that we
should concur in the amendments which have
been made, but I want it understood that
they do not include what a large number of
members in this House feel they should include, and that any honourable member may
move further amendments on the motion for

amendments.

Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN:
Honourable
gentlemen. I should appreciate having your
attention for a few minutes while I move an
amendment to section 11 of this Bill. I shall
be very brief, for the matter to which I shall
refer is familiar to most honourable members
of this Hoîse, having been discussed at length
in another place. where the reasons for and
against the amendnents vere brought out
very forcibly.
I am going to move that at the end of the
schedule which is to be prepared at the close
of each year, and is supposed to reflect the
financial position of the Canadian National
Railways, reference be made not only to the
nvestment made in the railway by Canada.
as a proprietor, but also to the sums advanced
from year to year to make good the deficits
on the railway. The purpose which I have
in view is to my mind of paramount importance. From vear to year we are spending
$100.000.000 on the Canadian National Railways. which from y-ear to year are eating into
the very vitals of this country. Is it not
absolutely- necessary that we should grapple
with this awful problem. which weighs so
heavily on the shoulders of the people of
Canada? And how vill it be settled unless
the people of Canada are made aware of the
gravity of the situation and the necessity of
an immediate settlement?
In the statement as prepared by the Government. which is to be circulated throughHon. Mr. DANDURAND.

out the financial world, no reference at all is
made to the past history of the Canadian
National Railways. This statement will go
not only to the financial houses, but to the
people throughout this country, and unless
something is done along the line proposed,
the people will easily forget the tremendous
amount of money that we have buried in our
railways. It seems to me that if we have a
duty to perform towards the Canadian people
it is to keep continually before their eyes a
statement of the amount we have spent on
the Canadian National Railways and the
amount it is costing us every year.
The only objection to including a footnote-an objection which at first sight may
appear to be serious-is that if there is such a
reference in the statement of the Canadian
National Railways they are going to be discredited in advance before the financial world
and will be in a worse position than ever in
relation to any borrowings they have to make.
I say, honourable gentlemen, that at first
sight this objection may seem to have soee
merit, but if you reflect upon it for a few
seconds you will find that it is not sound. Is
it possible to conceive of the Canadian National Railways borrowing one red cent on its
own credit? No, it is not. If it borrows at
ail. it must have the endorsation of the Government.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:

Of the

country.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I should sav of
Canada. But thei public accounts of Canada
show the amounts which Canada has inve -ted
in this railwav. Therefore. what this Bill attempts to eliminate from the statement of the
Canadian National Railwavs will verv soon be
discovered by the bankers. who will investigate the solvency of the endorser of the note
made by the Canadian National Railwavs.
They will go to the public accounts and there
they will find exactly how much Canada has
invested and how much she has paid everv
year for deficits of the railway. Thorefore
absolutelyv nothing is to be gained by refusing
to include the footnote.
I come now to this point. that all of us in
Canada must make a trernendous effort to
settle the problems of the Canadian National
Railways.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask the
honourable senator a question? If we gave the
Canadian National Railways away to-day for
one dollar, would Canada not still have more
than $100.000,000 of railway obligations te
meet for many years to come?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
done.

What is done is

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Will the honourable
gentleman answer the question?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: There is no doubt
my honourable friend is quite right. What xve
have epeut is gone. For my part I cannot
sea why, aven within thec next ganeration, any
corporation or group would wish to take over,
aven as a gift, this railway whieh has de-

ficits of $100,00O,000.

What my honourable

friand says is quita true, but it has nothing
to do with the question.
Hon. MT. MURDOCK: No?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: My argument is that
tha electors of this country must ha constantly reminded of the fact that they have
invastad a colossal am.ount of money in this
enterprse..and that every year that amount is
ireedby the sum of $100,0O0,00O. The
credit of Ca nada cannot stand that drain much
longer. Therefore we must seize every possible
opportunity to impress the true situation upon
the public. If we do flot giva the facts in the
Canadian National's statement we shaîl ba

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Doas it maka any

able membars, I would asic my honourable
friend from Montarvilla (Hon. Mr. Beaubian)
not to mox e just yet the amendment which
ha has suggasted, for I arn rising now to tell
hlm how far the Govarnmant would be disposed to go towards meeting bis wishas. I
wili prefaca that statement with a faw ramarks.
My honourable friand desires to have included on the balance shaet -of the Canadian
National a footnota and sehedula showing the
financial history of tha road so far as can ha
indicatad by Canadian Governmant contributions to date. Ha says that bis objectand perhaps it is bis only objet-in wishing
to hava this information shown is to impress
upon the people the vastness of the publie
investmant in this road, so, that they will
demand that something ha done to put an
end to our railway expenditures. My answer
is that, in accordance with section 24 of this
Bill, the public accounts of Canada will hava
to contain a complete statement of ail assistance given by the Dominion Government to
any railway. This section was amended in
our committea to provide for aven more detailed information than it called for when the
Bill reachad us from the other House. So if
this measure is passed, the benevolenca of
Canada towards ail railways-towards the
Canadian Pacifie, for instance, as wall as ta-

3I8

SENATE

wards the Canadian National-will have to be
shown. The Government suggests that sums
which have been given to the Canadian National, and which everybody admits will never
be repaid, should disappear from the balance
sheet. J would draw the attention of the
Senate to the fact that the Canadian Pacifie
Railway never includes in its annual balance
sheet a statement of the Government's benefactions towards it; and, as honourable members are aware. companies whieh have found
it necessary to undergo financial reorganization-as numerous companies have since
1929-do not show in their subsequent balance
sheets the sacrifices made by their shareholders. The dead wood is alhays eliminated.
My honourable friend wants attached to the
Canadian National's balance sheet a schedule
showing in detail the sums we have spent on
the system since its inception. As we know,
in taking over the Canadian Northern and the
Grand Trunk we took over some fifty subsidiaries in each case; I think the total number of subsidiaries is one hundred or more.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: There are 127.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think, as my
right honourable friend says, they nuimber
127. They will now be dealt with in the
balance sheet, and in accordance with this Bill
an effort will be made to unify the accounting
and administration of those railhays.
My honourable friend says, "You must
carry into the balance sheet the history of
the benefactions of the Dominion to these
railways, in order that the picture may be so
ugly that the people of Canada will give heed
to the situation and try to remedy it." I do
not think that five or ten years hence the
attitude of the people of Canada, will be much
different from what it is to-day, nor do I
believe the public will ever agree to transfer
the Canadian Nation-al systein to private
ownership, or surrender its administration to
the Canadian Pacifie Railway Company.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDITRAND: If that company can to-day excrt soume influence on the
Parliament of Canada, I should be very fearful of its power when it controlled both great
railway systems. Then the Dominion would
be the tail and would be wagged by the dogthe private company with that immense
monopoly in its hands. So we may as well
dismiss from our minds any suggestion that
by keeping before the people the present
picture

Mr. DANDURAND.

hope of bringing order out of our present
financial difficulties. I know the Canadian
National Railway System is costing this
country a good deal of money every year.
i hope that eventually its revenues will reach
the point where it will no longer need the
help of the Government periodically.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Never.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend to my left sayvs "N exer." We in this
Cbamtber have been trying to advance soute
constructive suggestions for the solution of
this railhay probleim.
The electorate has
been consulted more than once and bas never
expro-sed any desire to abandon the Canadian National Railways as a state-owned
system.
Whatever means we may find to
better the finances of our railwars. I am
convinced that the effort now made through
the balance sheet to inpres the people of
Canada writh the past failures of the systemt
will not bring about the result which my
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) bas
in mind. The Canadian National Railways
have had operating deficits since 1920, but
this circumstance has never deterred Parliament from voting large suims for the
development of the system. If to-morrow te
people of Canada should feel there was need
for expansion of the Canadian National Railways and consequently for an increase of
capital expenditure. would the Senate sav
no to a proposal from the other House for
that purpose? I doubt whether our attitude
would be any different from what it Pas been
during the last fifteen years.
My honourable friend ias said that it would
not matter if the balance sheet of the Canadian National Railways containing the proposed appendix. with information as to the
moneys we have granted to the system to
bring it up to its present condition. did go
to the two great financial centres of the
world. London and New York, because, he
ias pointed out, investors k-now very well that
any loans will be made, not on Canadian
National Railway assets and standing, but
on the credit of the Canadian Government,
and they will look to the publie accounts of
Canada for financial information.
That is
where we feel the statement should appear
of all expenditures made since accounts of the
National Railways have been included in the
public accounts. My honourable friend adtoits that the true situation will be shown
there and eau be studied by investors.
I have been wondering why we should be
required to include ail past expenditures in
the balance sheet of the Canadian National
Railhays. I have heard around this building

APRIL 7, 1937
that the Canadian Pacifie Company was insistent that its rival's balance sheet should be
so loaded. That may be. but 1 submit that
the picture to be presented to investors and
to the people at large should be the balance
sheet prescribed by the Bill. This woiild
overcome the difficulty of the Canadian National Railways' total expenditure being added to the total expenditure of the Government. with a resultant duplication of some
$1 ,500,000,000.
We discussed the question at considerable
length in the Railway Committee, and tbe last
objection we met was as to whether the grants
made by the Dominion to the Canadian National Railways should be included in the
publie accounts or in the railway system's accounts. The argument has been advanced that
if the new balance sheet is distributed throughout the country an impression will be created
that the systemn is; doing so well as to justify
demands for further capital expenditure and
increased wages. I doubt very much wbether
the balance sheet of the Canadian National
Railways is circulated among the masses. We
know that the people are kept informed of the
true situation of the National Railways
through the press and the discussions in the
special committee of the House of Commons
which deals with Canadian National Railways'
We have no corresponding cornfinances.
mittee, but through the sources I have mentioned and discussions in this Chamber and in
the other, full publicity is given to the finances
of the National Railways. After all, what are
Indeed, what
the people concerned about?
are the majority of bonourable members of
the Senate concerned about? I wonder how
many honourable members study the Canadian
National Railways' balance sheet. Bach year
we know the extent of the operating deficit
of the Canadian National Railway System, and
when the deficit for the past fiscal year was
found týo be considerably lower than usual the
fact was beralded in the press. The management of the Canadian National Railways is
trying to establish equilibrium between expendîtures and receipta, and so bring the
system nearer to the point where it will be
no longer in the red. In nine cases out of
ten, if not in ninety-nine cases out of a
hundred, the people of Canada rely on the
presentation of the accounts of the Canadian
National Railways before the special co-mmittee of the flouse of Commons to ascertain
to what extent the systemn has improved its
position.
I cannot accept the proposaI that in the
balance sheet of the Canadian National Railways there should app-ear a achedule giving ex-

penditures on the system in the form of subsidies whicb will neyer be recovered. I would
point out that in 1933 the late Governmrent
introduced what is now known as the Canadian National-Canadian Pacifie Act, which
provides that advances to the Canadian
National Railways shaîl not be funded. Since
then the moneys voted each year to cover
deficits have flot appeared in the balance
sheet of the company. We simply ask that
the same principle should be carried back year
by year; that previous deficits, with the formidable interest that bas accrued, should likewise be omitted. Those deficits and accrued
interest will be shown in detail ia the publie
accounts.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: But at that
point my honourable friend should also say
that in addition týo carrying back the omission of the deflcita-not necessary. I think,
when you do flot refund-the Bill cancels
$5300O0,0O0 of intereat, not on deficits but on
capital advances.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Whîch my right
honourable friend admits will neyer be collected.
]Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Unless the
honourable senator opposite me (Hon. Mr.
Casgrain) is wrong.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Under those con-.
ditions I do not thînk we should treat the
shareholders of the Canadian National Railways-the people of Canada--differently fromr
the manner in which the Canadian Pacific
R41ailway Company and all other companies
that have had to adjust their finances, treat
their shareholders in respect of the information
contained in their balance sheets. We should
content ourselves with what appears in the
Bill. I direct my honourahle frien1's attention
to page 14A of the Bill, where he will find
appendix No. 5, headed: " Canadian National
Railways System. Consolidated Balance Sheet
at December 31, 1936-Propoýsed Revision."
And then the words, "After Adjustment." If
my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Beaubien)
will accept my suggestion, 1 shahl be glad to
add a footnote based on *an amendment to
clause 11. That clause reads as follows:
11. The accounts of the -National Railway
System shahl be stated as of January firist,

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:

Yes, it

is.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: That is the amendment to clause 11.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: Honourable members,
the footnote, which will be attached to the
statement on pages 14 and 14a, reads as follows:
Proprietor's equity is included in the net
debt of Canada and in the detailed historical
record of Government assistance to railways,
as shown in the publie accounts of Canada.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: That is the amendment to clause 11.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: That is the footnote.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The point is
that the honourable gentleman opposite has
not moved. an amendment. My honourable
friend to my right (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) had
to tie his amendment in with the Bill, and
he proposed that clause 11 provide for a
footnote. If instead of the amendment proposed we were to take the amendment suggested by the leader of the House, it would
read:
That the following words be added to section
11 and, as a footnote, to the balance sheet:
"Proprietor's equity is disclosed in the net
debt of Canada."
That is the position we are in now. I wish
to say a few words on the proposed amendment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I suggest that
my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Beaubien)
should not move the amendment, so that we
may have an opportunity to see if we can
agree.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. I may
say that I appreciate greatly the evident
effort of the honourable leader of the Bouse
to avoid a clash of views and a vote on this
matter. I do not think it is a fitting subject
for a clash of opinion. Perhaps I do not
appreciate the position or its gravity. I
know it is important, but I do not think the
exact terms of the footnote or its exact location is a matter that goes to the very roots
of our life, and I think that we ought to
be able in some way to agree upon the
subject. Before I sit down I shall make a
suggestion as to what I think ought to be
accepted by the House; and I would ask
honourable members, especially those around
me, to address themselves to the problem in
the same spirit in which I seek to address
myself to it now.
The honourable senator to my right (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien) bas proposed an amendment,
and bas stated as cogently as anybody could

321

the reasons for it. I will not attempt ta
improve upon his presentation, because I
could not do so. There is, be says, a big problem confronting this Dominion; it has been
before us for years; it is growing in intensity,
as is the peremptory character of the demand
for its solution, and in all we do in the
interest of Canada we ought to keep the
nearness and the real danger of that problem
before our people in order that they may
see the necessity for facing the situation and
meeting it.

The Bill before us is to provide for a new
form of bookkeeping for the Canadian National Railways. Everybody recognizes that
it does not add a dollar to the value of this
country's assets.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Just tilting at a windmill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It just deals
with the form of the National Railways'
balance sheet. We own the railway, or any
equity there is in it; consequently it does
not matter one whit whether the Bill passes
or not. From the beginning of the discussion, and many times in committee, I have
emphasized the importance of a fair balance
sheet, that is to say, the importance of
presenting the real picture of the position
of the National Railways, free from unnecessary figures. Something had to be done
to bring that about. We have all admitted
that the balance sheet, by reason of the incorporation in it of the par value of stock
in railroads taken over, contained figures that
were merely cumbersome and did not truly
reflect the assets or the liabilities.
But in the attempt to reach the desired end,
the Bill eliminated all the debt of the railway already included in the debt of Canada.
That is quite easily understood. Those who
presented the Bill to us said: "When you have
in one set of figures the aggregate debt of
your subsidiary, the Canadian National Railways, and in another set the aggregate debt
of the country, and have over a billion included in the two, you have to explain to
anyone to whom you are trying to sell your
bonds or your credit that there is a duplication, and you have to argue out the whole
thing with them." That is true. In the
committee those who agreed with me took the
position that while it was important that
there should be no duplication, because of
the possible effect on our credit and the necessity of making explanations, this could be
avoided by the presentation of a consolidated
balance sheet of the Dominion of Canada
and the Canadian National Railways.

31117-21
REVISED EDITION

322

SENATE

I felt that was the better way, but I did
not press my opinion on the matter in the
committee, because I was strongly of the
view that it was far better to endeavour to
improve 'the Bill in some way that we could
agree upon than to place this House in the
position of an antagonist of the other House
in relation to a measure of this character.
So I did not even propose an amendment.
The only other thing we thought could be
done to improve the measure was this. While
agreeing to the balance sheet as provided for
by the Bill-agreeing to its terms in toto and
to the removal of the duplication in the way
chosen by the Government-we thought something should be done to make it impossible
for anyone to say to the Canadian people:
"Now your problem is done. We have cleaned
it all up by bookkeeping. We thought we
were under a heavy burden and had a great
mountain to scale; but that is true no longer,
for we have removed them with a fountain
pen"-the way it was to be done in Alberta.
And so that a multitude of people who are
susceptible to that kind of thing should not
be affected, we said it was bctter to attach
to the balance sheet a statement to the effect
that in order to present this balance sheet
we had to write off a vast sum of advances to
the railroad. It was felt that with this explanation a more wholesome condition of
mind would be created and the balance sheet
would be a more faithful statement of the
facts.
There are a great many people in this
country who consider this matter very important. While I think it important. I do
not think the life or death of the country
depends upon it. I believe that in a statement which purports to reveal the exact
situation it is desirable that there should be
something which puts the people of the
country on guard against coming to the conclusion that we have wiped ont all our
troubles by simply adopting the brilliant idea
of a new firm of accountants.
The suggestion of such an ameudment was
met, much to my astonishment, by a most
obdurate and uncompromising attitude on
the part of the Minister. WTe appreciate
having ministers present in our committees.
It is important that we should understand
their viewpoint. It is net the purpose of this
House to defeat Government measures, and
we cannot be criticized as having adopted
such a policy, for we have not done so. All
measures but one thut have come to us from
this same Minister haie passed this House,
though politically his enemies here are two to
one. Some of those measures passed over
my objection, my friends on this side refusing
to support me. I was astonished and shocked,
Right Hon.

Mr.

\IEIGHEN.

therefore, when, after the defeat of that one
measure, the Minister gave a statement to
the press that the Senate could not forget its
politics.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: We were very generous.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Very generous indeed. After two of his measures had
been supported by this House his challenge as
to the sincerity of this House was, I think,
most uncalled for.
Then with reference to this Bill the Minister says: "No. I cannot stand even a footnote.
Even though you leave the balance sheet
intact, I am not going to let you put in a
footnote referring to a schedule which gives
the real position of the road." He went so
far as to tell us that such a footnote would
destroy the whole Bill, and that he would
rather have the old balance sheet. with all its
horrors; and he stated that this was the
opinion of the Deputy Minister of Finance
of this country, as well as of other officials.
I say now what I said in the committeethat a more absurd and preposterous proposition was never addressed to intelligent people.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There ought
to be a reasonable attitude on the part of
ministers. I am sure that if the honourable
leader of the House Nad been the Minister.
or if the Minister who addressed us to-day
in reference to another matter had been in
charge of this Bill, we should never have had
any difficulty.
In opposing the suggestion made. the honourable leader of the House said, "We do not
want these liabilities in the balance sheet."
I know we do not. We have decided that
they shall not be in it. We suggest, not that
they go into the balance sheet, but that there
be an appendix of information so that no
misconception may arise.
My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) said also that while our railway
proble m nust be solved, it cannot be solîed
by the absorption of the Canadian National
Railivays into the Canadian Pacific Railway,
because the country is opposed to such a
solution. I agree with the bonourable gentleman in his estimate of the attitude of the
electorate of Canada. I do not think the
people of Canada are yet in a mood to concede the necessity of the absorption of the
National systemu by the Canadian Pacifie. Let
me add that I think they are now more disposed to agree to absorption than they were
some years ago.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Hear, hear.

APRIL 7, 1937
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But I accept
the statement of the leader of the House that
the mai ority are not yet ready for it.
The only reason I mention ýthat point is
this. I wonder what becomnes of the honourable gentleman's criticismn of those who advooated the taking over of the Canadian Northern in 1917 and the Grand Trunk in 1920 rather
thýan absorption. Was the country then ready
for it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But that was
not an inevitable solution. We asked that the
affairs of the railways be placed in the hands
of a receiver.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: How easy it
is teo 6uggest that if we had not acquired the
Canadian Northe-rn in 1917 and the Grand
Trunk in 1920 there would have been receiverships, but no absorption. I wonder. My
honourable friend did know, though lie may
have forgotten, that in 1917 negotiations were
aiready on to sell the stock of the Canadian
Northern to the Canadian Pacifie. The owners of that stock certainly had a riglit to seil
it. I do not know how the suggestion was
-received by the Canadian Pacifie, but I know
what the attitude -of the Canadian Nortliern
was. There is flot the slightest doubt in my
mind that if that sale had been made the
result would have been absorption riglit then.
Those wbo prevented it are now castigatedeven by persons who say that up Vutliis very
day, chastened by de-ficits of fifteen years, the
Canadian people stilil wouid not agree te, the
absorption of týhat road by the Canadian
Pacifie. And in 1920 the Grand Trunk undoubtedly would bave gone into receiveýrship if
we liad not taken it -over.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Oh, no, not the
Grand Trunk, but the Grand Trunk Pacifie.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That was in
receivership.
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Yes.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Certainly.
I stili have on file letters stating that there
had to lie receivership for the Grand Trunk,
and that riglit away. The honourable leader
thinks that would have been ail riglit. Hie
does not deny tha-t receivership was certain,
but lie says that wouid not have meant
absorption by the Canadian Pacific. I wonder
if that is so. Is a receivership a permanent
situntion? Is the duty of a receiver to serve
the public or to serve the owners of the
property which as receiver he is operating?
Certainiy it is Vo serve the owners. Therefore a recciver would have disposed of that
railroad, or part of it, on the best terms that
lie could have arranged, and as soon as pos31117-21J

323

sible. No one disputes that. That would
have been the inevitabîs destiny of the Grand
Trunk, a destiny which honourable members
opposite say the people of Canada would not
tolerats even at this hour. Yet, many times
in committees of Vhis fouse I amn pointed at,
and the pointing finger is meant to indicate:
"You are the fellow who brouglit those
railways upon us." What do lionourable
gentlemen now think of their consistsncy?
Hon. Mr. DUJFF: We should have taken
Rochi Lanctôt's advice and sold the railways
for a dollar.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We couid not
have soid them for a dollar; we could not
have got anyone to take them for their liabilidies. We had either to take themn over ourselves or face their absorption by somebody
else. And if any honourabie member knows
of anyons who would do the absorbing, other
than that company which honourable senators
opposite say the people of Canada would not
yet permit to become the absorber, I should
like to 'be informed before I take my seat.
I corne now to a suggested amendment
which I should like to see moved and carried.
The Mînister certainiy sliould have aýccepted
this. We have liad from the honourabie
leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) a counter suggestion, that instead of
using a sclieduie te, the National Raiiway
balance sheet-and this wouid not be part of
the balance sheet at ail-to draw public attention to the Dominion's investment, we should
simply insert a footnote teiling people that
if tliey want a history of this investment
tliey may look at the public accounts. That
would flot lie nearly as good or effective as
a scheduie. First of ail, in referring people Vo
the public accounts you have to refer themn
to accounts for the year before. And what
1 cannot understand is wliy they sliouid lie
referred Vo anything at ail. Wliy should they
flot lie given the information in one document? It is suggested that a sclieduie stating
that the Dominion of Canada lias advanced
to the railway a certain sum, $1,363,000,000
of which is written off, would frigliten financiers wlio otherwise miglit invest in bonds of
the Canadian National. That suggestion is
made in face of the manifest fact that there
is not a human being between the South
Pole and the North Pole who wouid invest
a five-cent piece in tlie Canadian National but
for the credit of the Dominion of Canada.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hearl
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Does anyone say that people are g-oing Vo lie influenced
by the Canadian National's balance sheet in
deciding whether to invest money in that

system, which is losing $50,000,000, perhaps
$100,00)0,000, a yeaT-a ro-ad whose lasses last
year, aside from a saving in interest, were
greater than those of the ),ear before? That
suggestion is facetiaus. Money provided for
the Canadian National is provided on the
credit of the Dominion Governrnent. Therefore the sehedule would flot have the sligbtest
effeet on any prospective bond purchaser. Its
only possible effeet-and the only effeet intended-would be on taxpiyers and voters of
this country, in preventing thern from getting
misconceptions. It is mast unfortunate that
the Minister declined ta agree ta the amendment proposed in cornmittee, an arnendment
ta whicb no valid opposition can be offered
and one as ta which he made suggestions
which were resented by honourable members
on bath sides of that committee, I arn sure.
I arn now going ta make a suggestion. If
we are ta substitute the hanourable gentleman's proposed footnote. which would advise
readers of the Canadian National's balance
sheet ta take a look also at the public
accounts, that footoote should at least state
the aggregate of those claims included in the
proprietar's equity. 1 should prefer ta have it
read somewhat like this:
Praprietor's equity, including elainis, aggreia the net
gating $1,363,000,000, is disclae(
debt of Canada and in thue detailecl histarical
record of Goveramient assistance ta railways,
as shown in the publie accouats of Canada.
I promise my honourable friend that if he
wjll amend his footnote to the extent here
suggested, w~e on this side will yield a position which we feel is a very strong anc. Those
who read the balance sheet would then be
given at least the real total of the dlaims and
warned that the proprietor's equity as showa
un the balance sheet is but a reduced figure.
lIn this total of dlaims not ýah deficits paid
sunce 1927 would be incîuded. But I arn nat
particular as ta anc million nor as ta a

this total, wouîd at least gix e siifficieuut warning ta preveat seriaus publie misconception.
If we cannot agree upon this point now,
I think we ought nlot ta detain honourable
members here in debatiag the matter. 0f
,course, anyone who wishes ta talk upon it
us free ta do sa. We perhaps might go an
ta other business and came back ta this later
with a view ta seeing if by then it is not passible ta came ta some agreement.
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: Honaurable
senators, I do not want ta get started on a

very good friend of mine.
My honourable friend from Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) says he wants the
Canadian National's balance sheet to look
bad so that our people will realize the
system is losing money.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:

I want

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN:

ta show
The truth

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I do nlot know
whether that is alto.-ether wise. The Canadian National bas to borrow frequently. Now,
a corporation which must borrow sbould nlot
make its balance sheet look unnecessarily
bad. 1 arn afraid I may be tbought very disrespectful when I say that the ameodment
suggested by my honourable friend from
Montarville would not have any effect upon
the annual deficit which is causing us so much
misery. 1 may tell this House the deficit

is more than $100,000,000.

The adoption of

that amendment would not resuIt in the deficit being cither increased or decreased ta
the slightest extent. The ameadment would
have as much effect as a mustard plaster on
a wooden leg.
I cmn teil7honourable members how we
could reduce the deficit. That is by having
the courage to adopt the railway rates that
prevail in the United States, whcre they hav e
double the population that we have per mile
of railway. Or let us adopt the rates prevailing in Australia. Strange ta say, 1 do
not know aayoae here who can state what
the Australian rates are. I have hunted for
the information. inquired from the Canadian
Pacifie, writtcn letters, and s0 on, ail in
vain. But I kaow the rates there are much
higher ýthan hiere. It is a wonder that the
Canadian Pacifie does not kaow what the
Australian rates are.

APRIL 7, 1937
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable gentleman knows the reason, does he
not?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Because the
South African Government will not permit
freight to be carried on a truck more than
twelve miles outside a city, even on a truck
owned by the man who owns the freight.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: If in this country
we had the courage to charge the rates that
prevail in the United States, in South Africa,
or Australia, our railroad problem would be
solved. I heard Sir Henry Thornton say
many times, "Give me the rates that prevail
in the United States and I will give you a
surplus every year."
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Honourable
members, do not be alarmed about the possible length of my speech. I move the
adjournment of the debate.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Until to-morrow?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would not
say to-morrow. As we are approaching the
end of the session, we might find it convenient to resume the debate later to-day.

it is necessary to specify when the debate will

COMBINES INVESTIGATION BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill 41, an Act to amend
and consolidate the Combines Investigation
Act and amending Act.
The Bill was read the first timp.

SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: With leave
of the Senate, I move second reading of this
Bill now, so that it may be sent on to the
Banking and Commerce Committee.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

All right.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Should I give a
short explanation of the Bill?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think so.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We are living
in troublous times when many people are
agitated over economic problems bearing on
their welfare, and there is unrest throughout
the land. The relations between capital and
labour are in the limelight. Those who have
not suspect they are being exploited by those
who have. We have heard complaints, even
in this Chamber, that we have too many
inquiries in progress-too many royal commissions going up and down the country.
Measured by immediate results, they may at
times appear useless, but they serve a useful
purpose in allaying suspicion and fear. On
all sides one hears denunciations of trusts
and mergers. I have on other occasions
stated in this Chamber that the system of
capitalism can continue only so long as
it is fair and just to the masses-the consumers. I believe the Senate of Canada must
face that position and support any measure
to deal with grievances which may arise in
the development and application of the
system.
This Bill is designed to effect several
much-needed changes in the Combines Investigation Act, with the object of making that
legislation a more efficient instrument for
safeguarding the public interest against detrimental combinations and monopolies. For
some years the Combines Investigation Act
has not been utilized to the full extent of
its appropriate functions. In some degree
this has been due to certain provisions in the
legislation itself. Even before the amendments of 1935, it was the view of those who
had its administration in charge that the Act
stood in need of improvement. Some of the
amendments made in 1935 had the effect of
weakening rather than strengthening the Act.
Those amendments tended rather to restrict
its scope or to add to the difficulties of its
enforcement. It will be recalled that during
last session the Government sought to remove
one of the outstanding disabilities, but the
proposed amendment was rejected by the
Senate.

SENATE
It is now proposed to restore the vigour
of the Act and to make it more effective by
the amendments set forth in this Bill. Among
the changes proposed are the following:
1. The administration of the Act under
the Minister of Labour by a single commissioner devoting his whole time to this
work, instead of by a commission whose
members have other important responsibilities,
relating to tariff matters.
2. Provision for the appointment, if necessary, of temporary special commissioners to
conduct single investigations.
3. The revision and extension of the definitions of merger, trust and monopoly.
4. The removal of the provision enacted in
1935 which prevents the use, in subsequent
criminal proceedings against the person who
produced them, of documents which a person
is required to produce in an investigation.
5. An increase in the maximum penalties
for the violation of the Act.
Those are the more important changes contemplated. I should like to enter into a
fuller explanation, but I believe that in the
Banking and Commerce Committee we shall
have ample opportunity to discuss the meaning and purport of every section of this
measure.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I do not intend to oppose
second reading. I have read the Bill, though
I have not been able to give it any
special attention. I think it is only fair for
me to say now that there is a feature of it
which I should like -the Government to reconsider. In this country from end to end, more
emphatically in certain parts, there is an
increasing tendency to wave the courts of
the Dominion off the scene and direct officials
of the Administration to take their place.
That tendency may go a certain distance and
perhaps not be observed; its real significance
may not be appreciated.
But this is its
significance: it is just wiping out, blasting
into atoms, the liberty of the subject, which
is the mainstay of British institutions and the
main triumph of British democracy. From
the perusal I have given this Bill I think
there is in it something of that tendency. If
human rights or rights of citizenship are to
be determined, we have for that purpose
institutions which are an integral and vitally
important factor in our constitutional system,
the very corner-stone of our freedom. They
are the institutions which should decide these
matters. It can all be done without some
official of the Government being made a
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

judge of the land. Sufficient powers can be
given to enable the facts to be adduced without officials being substituted for the judiciary,
or the sacred rights of citizens being dissipated.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
As my right
honourable friend appreciates, our industrial
activities are so diverse, and change so rapidly
from year to year, that there are times when
the public feels that Parliament should enact
legislation for the purpose of investigating the
operations of industrial concerns.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
right.

That is all

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think we have
had a fair experience of the administration
of this Act in the past. It has proved fairly
effective, and will be resorted to again to deal
with groups acting contrary to the public
interest. I would draw my right honourable
friend's attention to certain inquiries made
under the Act when responsible newspapers
pointed out that mounting costs of certain
commodities were due to monopolies, mergers
or trusts, and that public men were hand-inglove with those interests and were consenting
to oppression of the people. That state of
affairs produces unrest and arouses a desire
for a change in our economic system.
I
believe that more and more the country
will need the exercise of such powers as are
to be found in this Bill, in order that the
fears and suspicions of the people may be
allayed. Already action in certain instances
has helped to clear the atmosphere. I am sure
that as similar situations arise they will
demonstrate the need for this proposed
legislation.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading of the Bill.

Hon. A. C. HARDY: Honourable senators, I am net going te raise opposition to
the passing of this Bill, for I think that in
any case it will meet with the faveur of the
House; but I do want to say a few words
about what I might term the general morality
of the whole Act.
A few days ago the honourable leader of
the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) read a
memorandum which, I take it, was submitted
to him by the department. If I remember
correctly, the gist of it was that complaints
of these fruit and vegetable importers were
more or less a "racket." Whether that word
was used on the floor or this House, I am not
certain at this moment, but I know it was
used in general conversation and more or
less informally in the committee.
I went to the committee with perhaps not
an absolutely open mind, for after hearing that
memorandum and the general summing up
I felt the claims were another example of the
raids on the federal treasury to which we
have been accustomed for the last three or
four years: raids first by the provinces, next
by the municipalities, and then by almost
every small corporation able to find a claim
of some kind te make against the treasury
of Canada. That was what I had in my
mind when I went to the committee, but after
hearing both sides I came to the conclusion
that, if there was a racket at all, the parties
guilty of it were the Department of National
Revenue and the Dominion of Canada.
I am not going into the whole matter now,
because I do not want to delay the House,
but I may say that those who were present
at the sittings of the Committee on Banking
and Commerce were fairly well convinced
that while the applicants for those rebates
did not have a good case, they had a number
of very serious grievances.
The first grievance was on the cuirency
item. On this the total of the claims was
small. I think the importers failed to make
good their claims because most of what they
paid out was reimbursed to them by their
customers. At the same time we could see
that the department had acted in a most arrogant and unwarranted way in imposing a tax
on the appreciated currency of the United
States. Undoubtedly that is quite true. The
Minister himself did not want to admit absolute iniquity, or, I might say, inequity in
the matter, and said there was doubt about
it. but the real facts showed there could be
no doubt about it at all. The department
had not the slightest legal ground for imposing taxes on the appreciated currency of
another nation. The legislation gave the
department the right to adjust depreciated

328

SENATE

currency, and that was done; but officials of
the department, of their own free action,
imposed the tax also on appreciated currency. Though in my opinion the claimants
did not maie out a good case, I mention
this to show the absolutely illegal method
of the department's action.
As for the taxes and super-imposts actually
levied as seasonal extra duties, I cannot
imagine in the action of any other department
so many inconsistencies. I dislike to use the
word "irregularities," because that word seems
to carry with it an offensive significance.
The burdens imposed upon importers in this
respect constituted a real grievance. In speaking to-day my only hope is that what was
disuiosed at the sittings of the committee
will have the effect of inducing the Minister
to bring about such a readjustment of affairs
;n his department that there will be equity
md fair treatment for our importers.
It just happens that the claimants who
came before the committee were importers
of very perishable goods-vegetables and fruit.
We all know that when a carload of goods
of this kind arrives in Canada from a very
distant point it must be taken into possession at once. There is no possible chance of
returning the goods to the source whence
they came. The car must be opened and
the goods sold within a day or two, or they
will be utterly worthless. Still we find in
this case that nnt only did the importers
have to pay the high duties imposed by the
new regulations of the Government, or of the
department, but a week, two weeks or three
weeks after the goods had been actually sold
they were subjected to an entirely new assessment by the department. It goes without
saying, it is utterly impossible for importers
of such goods to carry on business in this
country under these conditions, for when
goods are sold there is no possible way of
passing on extra charges to the purchasers
or the ultimate consumers.
I can point out to the Senate one casethis may not have any direct bearing on
the Bill-where a carload of material that
cost $350 in Texas was subjected to duties
of $850 before being cleared in this country.
In another case, where the goods cost $500
the duties amounted to $1,900. Those figures
seemed to me incredible until officers of the
department admitted they were correct.
The committee took this whole matter under
careful advisement and acted as it thought
best in the public interest. I do hope that
as a result of what was exposed before that
committee the Minister will be able so to
regulate his department that we shall have
Hon

Mr. HARDY.

these seasonal duties on a fair and equitable
basis.
In conclusion I wish to express my belief
that if we looked through the whole world
we could not find a better example than
we have here of the danger in the delegation
by Parliament of its taxing powers to any
person or department, or to what I should
call a bureaucracy. The sooner the Parliament of Canada keeps that absolute power
over taxation in its own hands and exercises
that power only from the floors of the Houses
of Parliament, the better it will be.
Hon. FRANK P. O'CONNOR: Honourable
senators, I wish to make a few remarks witlh
reference to what has been said by the
honourable gentleman from Leds (Hon.
Mr. Hardy).
It scems to me that we as
senators feel in our hearts a real responsibility towards the Government of this country
right now. We feel that way for many reasons,
one of which is the obvious effort the Government is making to achieve progress, through
its legislation, in the difficult times which we
are experiencing.
Therefore I submit we
should be more inclined to endorse Government bills. The right honourable leader on
the other side (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) expressed regret that he could not support the
Canadian National Railways Capital Revision
Bill unless it was amended to provide for a
footnote in the balance sheet of the Canadian National Railways showing what the
Dominion has contributed to the system. I
think we should pass that measure. The only
feature to which honourable members objected
was that the Bill contained no provision for
such a footnote. Well, the footnote would not
disclose anything; so why insist upon its insertion?
Let us co-operate more with the
Government at this time. For reasons of its
own, the Government does not want the $1,360,000,000 of Dominion contributions shown
on 'the Canadian National's balance sheet, but
is willing to have a footnote pointing out that
the financial history of the road may be seen
on reference to the public accounts. I think
we should support that accounting measure
and also the Customs Bill, which is just now
before us.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, perhaps I have already gone
too far along the lines suggested by the
honourable senator who has just sat down. I
should be more disposed to agree automatically
with decisions of the Government if he were a
member of it. For that state of affairs we
shall have to wait a little while, it may be, but
I hope it will not be too long.

APRIL 8, 1937
May I say a few words as to the remarks
of the honourable senator from Leeds (Hon.
Mr. Hardy)? I think he had justification for
much that he said. There does seem to be
such general complaint of the administration
of the Customs Act that one of two conclusions
must follow: either the Act is unadministrable,
because of its nature, in respect particularly of
perishable goods such as fruits and vegetables,
or else there is lack of organization. Perhaps
there is some ground for criticism under both
heads. I believe the Act is difficult to administer.
I ask honourable members to keep in mind
that the very features which have been so
much criticized over the years are still in
effect. The Government is faced with this
situation. It is a question of keeping these
seasonal features, these more or less varying
features, in effect, or of abandoning the fruit
and vegetable areas of our country. It is
easy to urge their abandonment when we are
not in office; but when we are in office and
can see the possible results of our action, our
attitude is different. Abandonment is a very
serious thing to contemplate. It seems to me
that we shall continue to have, that we must
have, these more or less arbitrary and certainly
often temporary valuations and restrictions,
these seasonal features, in order to protect
different sections of the country. These features are necessarily very difficult to administer.
My approach to the subject was rather
different from that of the honourable senator from Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy). I went
to our committee strongly inclined against
this measure. I thought it not only had a
retroactive purpose-something from which
we all naturally recoil, though it sometimes
is an essential part of a measure-but that
it was an attempt to get over difficulties
arising from faulty administration and faulty
collection, so as to evade facing the situation
in our courts. But my mind was changed
during the hearings of the committee, and
the person who changed my mind was the
Minister of the department. I thought he
presented very capably and thoroughly a case
for the Bill. The part with which he had
most difficulty was the section referring to
the overcharges, brought to our attention by
the honourable junior senator from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. Haig) a few days ago; but even
there, although some honourable members
on this side of the House did not follow his
reasoning, I followed it and thought he was
right. Even there the essence of the claim
for recovery was technical. That claim was
simply that the method of reaching a certain
total of assessment for values was not the
method provided for in the Act. But the
same result could have been achieved by the

329

exact method for which the Act does provide;
and the method adopted and its result were
made known to the trade, which carried on
with that full knowledge. It does not seem
to me 'that people should be given a right to
rest upon such a flimsy base and perhaps
establish large claims against the Government. I was compelled by what I heard at
the committee to support the measure.
Irrespective of faulty administration, if such
there be, the Bill in my judgment ought to
pass.
One who has had to do with officers of a
department, and with complaints against it,
is perhaps more disposed than another would
be to give officers an opportunity of being
heard, rather than to come too hastily to
the conclusion that they are at fault. I
have often been of the opinion that officers
were arbitrary, hasty and inconsiderate, but
when they are before a committee and state
their reasons for what they are advocating
they do not usually come off second best.
I will simply repeat that in my judgment
we cannot take any other action than to
pass this Bill.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: May I say to my right
honourable friend that I am greatly interested
in finding him approving so heartily a Government Bill to which, as regards the general
atmosphere it would create, I cannot give
approval.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, I do not desire at this hour to criticize
the Bill; I rise simply to join in the sentiments expressed by my right honourable
leader (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen). I went
to the committee in a spirit of bitter hostility
and suspicion, but I was convinced by what
I heard there. I want to compliment the
Government on the Minister who is in charge
of the department administering the Customs
Act.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: He certainly made a fine
impression. I may be too young to judge
as to this kind of thingSome Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I was delighted by his
presentation. I want also to compliment the
departmental officers and others connected
with -the presentation. In our committees at
other times I have heard some ministers with
whom I could not agree and whose attitude I
did not like. Let me say that the country is
fortunate in having at the head of a department a man who can approach a subject as
the Minister of National Revenue approached
this subject before our committee.

330

SENATE

Hon. L. COTE: Honourable senators, I
wish to deal very briefly with two points arising from the discussion. I quite agree with
what lias been said by the honourable senator
from Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy), that so far
as possible the tariff of this country should
be made by Parliament and not by Order in
Council nor the Minister of National Revenue.
But, as pointed out by the right honourable
leader on this side (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen),
Parliament has deemed it necessary in certain cases to delegate its powers to the
Minister or to Council. Section 43 of the
Customs Act, dealing with seasonal duties, is
an example of this delegation. This section
was criticized when administered by the late
Government, but it has been retained by the
seems that the
present Government. It
method here provided is the only practical
one for the imposition of seasonal duties in
the circum-stances contemplated by the law.
May I point ont to the bonouîrable senator
froni Leeds that in this very Bill also there is
a delegation of the tariff-fixing power. Section
36A as amended reads:
The Governor in Council, whenever it is
deemed expedient to do se, may order that
import, excise and other duties and taxes, in
whole or in part, shall be disregarded in estimating the value for duty of goods of any kind
imported into Canada froin any specified
country.
The only thing new in the a.mended section
is the word "import." The Minister of National Revenue informed our committee last
night that this amendment would, under
Order in Council, give him authority when
fixing the value for duty of any goods coming
from a foreign country to disregard in whole
or in; paTrt the import taxes which that foreign
country nay charge its nationals on the verv
niaterials that enter into the goods to 1be

enable the Minister to fix tariffs from month
to month and from year to yvear.
As the honourable senator from Leeds bas
said, and as we hiave often been told. this is
Parliament should fix
a wrong practice.
the duties. Nevertheless we are now prepared
by enacting this section to create a condition
under which the Governor in Council or the
Minister will be able to fix the tariff.
I come now to section 3 of the Bill. As
the right honourable leader on this side of the
House bas stated, the Minister made out his
case on this section. But he did net base it
on legal grounds. He proved that the great
bulk of the complainants have no equitable
right to come to Parliament and ask that this
kegislation be not passed. because by their very
request to the Minister they brought upon
tInmselves the method under which he bas
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

imposed seasonal duties. However. the fact
remains, and the evidence disclosed, and the
Minister himself admitted, that a number of
the claimants never made that request to
the Government. They imported their merchandise before they knew there would be
such an assessment; consequently they never
had an opportunity of passing it on to the
because
we
are
consumer. Nevertheless,
right as to ninety-nine per cent of the cases,
we are going to make the hundredth case the
victim. That does not appeal to my sense of
fairness. The quantum of the injustice does
net change its character. Legislation which
unjustly deprives even one man of his claim
is a blet on the Statute Book.
I suppose it would be difficult, with the
means we have at our disposal, to ascertain
the names of those claimants against whom
the Minister's argument does not apply, and
probably for that reason we are disposed
te pass this legislation and take away all their
rights; but I would respectfully submit to the
Government that the Minister in charge of
the department bas by law the right te remit
duties whenever it is deemed in the public
interest, and I think he should review the
cases of those men against whom he cannot
advance the arguments which we heard last
night in committee and to-day in this House,
and should make them a refund. I do net
suppose the honourable leader of the Government could give an assurance in this
respect, but if he would do so I should certainly vote for this Bill with a lighter heart.
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH: Honourable
senators. the discussion on this Bill bas centred
around the question of the duty on fruit and
vegetables. I submit, however, that section
10 is likely te prove much more important
in the future than the subject so far under
discussion.
Section 10 deals with regulations of imports
and exports of arms. and I desire to draw
the attention of the House to that particular
In another place the discussion
section.
turned largely upon the question of "taking
the profit out of war." That discussion and
the newspaper comment that followed gave
the impression that the armament business is
immoral and improper. We were advised that
the Government was about te proceed to take
the profit out of armaments in time of war,
and the like. As a matter of fact the legislatien simply empowers the Government te
take certain steps in the national interest in
time of war.
As I say, the discussion in the other House
turned on the immorality of the armament
business, as though we had an armament industry in this country. For the manufacture

APRIL 8, 1937
of armaments we have the raw material,
nickel, asbestos, .copper, iron and steel, and
the like, but in point of fact we have no
armament industry worthy of the name. I
think we should have an armament industry.
I deprecate the discussion which has occurred
in the other House and in the press, suggesting that the armament business is something
so immoral that we ought not to engage in
it at all. and that those who engage in it
are likely to upset our form of government
and thrust us into a war against our will. I
think that is so much humbug.
We have the industries which could undertake the production of armaments. Parliament
has recently voted $37,000,000 for the re-equipment of our defence forces. We are spending
that money entirely outside this country. I
think we should spend it inside. We should
develop an armament industry and so provide
work and wages for our people. Those who
hold the view the armament industry is
immoral agree that we should have a defence
force and should purchase equipment outside
the country, but they hold it would be strictly
improper to purchase equipment of the same
sort within Canada, notwithstanding that we
have the raw materials for its manufacture.
The establishment of an armament industry
in this country would enable us, in the first
place, to provide for our own equipment;
secondly, to provide in part for the equipment
of our armed forces throughout the Empire;
and, finally, to engage in the export of
armaments, a trade which is being carried on
to-day and is likely to be carried on in the
future.
Two advantages would accrue to us from
an armament industry: it would be maintained without cost to the Government, and
would be available to the country in time of
national emergency.
In this connection I would draw attention
to an interesting fact. As honourable members know, there is a vast armament industry
in Great Britain. At the time of the outbreak of the Great War three capital ships
were nearing completion in British shipyardsone for Turkey, another for Brazil and the
third for Chile. Those great battleships were
subsequently completed. The Government of
Great Britain then took them over and thus
added materially to the country's naval
strength. Several other ships were under construction for foreign powers, and, as well,
large quantities of armaments. These, too,
were taken over by the British Government.
A well-established armament industry in
Canada would contribute to our national
defence, and its products would be available
at a lower cost than would be possible in
government-owned factories. But there would

331

be a further and very important advantage.
The British Government has decided to disperse its armament industries throughout the
Empire. They are not to be centred in one
country, where they can be destroyed or
seriously crippled by bombardment from the
air. South Africa is one of the countries
suggested, Australia another, and Canada still
another. In view of the decision of the
British Government, and the fact that we have
all the raw materials for armament manufacture, I submit there is every reason for establishing the industry in this country.
I am raising this question because in the
discussion to which I have referred some
odium has been attached to the armament
industry; so much, in fact, that it is likely
to discourage the establishment of such an
industry in Canada.
There are those who advocate that the
Government itself should undertake the manufacture of armaments. A royal commission
in Great Britain thoroughly explored such a
proposal and reported against it on the grounds
of the enormous capital investment involved,
idleness of the equipment during peace-time,
its deterioration, and the cost of maintaining
skilled employees to be available for service
when required. We al know that Government
operation is costly and inefficient.
The discussions to which I have referred
are, as I say, designed to discourage and
indeed frustrate any attempt to establish
an armament industry in Canada. Those who
denounce the manufacture of armaments by
private companies have a favourite expression. They say their purpose is "to take the
profits out of war." Now, there is a catchphrase. In time of war the main objective
of a country is to win the war; it is not to
engage in any attempt to take the profits out
of war or to prevent profits from being made.
If in time of war we are deflected from our
prime objective of winning the war, we are
apt to get into serious trouble. In time of
war the Government must seek to induce
existing plants to instal expensive equipment
and engage in the manufacture of war material,
and it must induce skilled men to operate
plants for the purpose of such manufacture.
In carrying out its policy the Government
must make it worth while for people to
undertake this work, the Government controlling undue profit by drastic taxation.
Manufacture of equipment by the Government
could be carried out only by our adopting
Socialism as a policy and socializing every
industry in the country, and when the war
was over we should probably have the utmost
difficulty in restoring industry to its normal
course.

332

SENATE

I attach importance to a discussion of this
subject at the present time, because, as I
sec the trend, our Government, at the suggestion of pacifists, idealists, and other wellintentioned people. is heading towards policies which would be disastrous te us in case
of war. My view is that the Government
should be empowered, as it is by this measure, to control the situation, but beyond that
it ought not to go. It ought not now to take
a stand that would prevent capital from considering the desirability of entering upon
these businesses, which, in their turn, would
develop our natural resources and make use
of our raw materials.
There is a good deal of humbug and nonsense talked about this subject of arms. One
of the outstanding examples is to be found
in the attitude of the British Government
at the time of the invasion of China by
Japan. some four or five years ago, when
Japan tore off from the Empire of China
the state of Manchukuo, consisting of three
or four provinces. An inquiry was held.
Japan was found to be the aggressor, and
China the victim. Nevertheless the British
Government, at the behest of a number of
pacifists and well-intentioned sentimentalists,
passed an embargo upon arms to both Japan
and China. China, the victim. needed arms
and equipment, but the action of the British
Governrnent resulted in penalizing unfortunate China and making certain the success
of Japan. That is a classical example of a
Government being directed by pacifists and
well-meaning sentimentalists who lack knowledge and understanding of the problem.
MY only purpose in rising at this tine
was to point out that this section of the Bill
provides the Government with power to deal
with this matter from now onward, and to
express the hope that the Government will
proceed in this matter with wisdom, understanding and knoxwledge. and with a sufficient
degree of courage to enforce this section of
the Bill with the one object of promoting the
national interest.
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: Before the motion is
put, may I ask the honourable gentleman
from Edmonton to define and explain the
words he used-that the Government is outlining a policy which would mean disaster in
time of war?
Hon.

Government vast powers which will be of
great importance in the future in the event
of war. It is provided that the Government
shall have power to deal with the exportation of arms, equipment and the like, and
what I complained of was that the discussion
on these sections of the Bill, though net very
closely related to them, had the effect of putting forward the idea that the manufacture
of armaments was an immoral and improper
business for the people of this country to
engage in. I deprecate that view. I say that
it is a sound industry which ought to be
developed because it would give work and
wages to oui people and make use of our natural products, such as copper, asbestos, nickel,
iron and steel, and that it would be in the
interest of our national defence. I rose to
discuss the industry at this time because no
other voice had been raised so far in defence
of it.
The motion was agreed te, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.

seems to me that that one step is not sufficient.
What we should like, and what we are insisting upon, is that the honourable leader should
try to convince his colleagues to go a further
step. Surely the purpose that we have in
view is very commendable. We have shown
beyond doubt that the footnote which we want
added to the Canadian National's balance
sheet would in no way disturb that balance
sheet as prepared by the Government. We
have in no way tried to hide the reason for
wishing to have included in the footnote the
aumount of total indebtedness of the Canadian

Government desires the support of the public
in the very difficult task of settling this tremendously heavy and crushing railway problem. If there is sufficient public support behind the Government, no doubt a solution
will be found. The difficulty about settling
the railway problem is a political one. Nobody
will deny that.
Hon. Mr. O'CONNOR: I will deny it. What
difference would tihis footnote make? That
thought has been impressed upon me by very
responsible persons in the Government. Wha't
objection, other than a political one, can there
be to having the balance sheet prepared as the
Government wants it-whether for reasons connected with the sale of bonds or for any other
reason?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I am quite frank
in saying that I do not quite understand my

very capable business man, and no doubt he
has an excellent reason for holding the opinion
which he has just expressed. I am simply
trying to express my own opinion for what it
is worth.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Will the honourable
gentleman permit a question? I have noticed
that he has just now, for the first time, used
the pronoun "I."
Up to this moment he has
been using the plural, "iwe."
May I ask
him whom he means by " we " when he uses
that word in this debate?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: My honourable
friend has taken very particular note of the
words I have used. I confess quite humbly
that I arm expressing only my own opinion, but
it is an opinion which I believe is shared by a
great many people throughout the land.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: My honourable friend
will admit that he has been using the word
we " up to the present.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Why should be net?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Order!
tlin. \Ir BEACBIEN.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I have no intention
of speaking at length, for I have not much
to add to what I said yesterday. The point
I am making now is that the amendment
whieh has just been moved does not go far
enough. By carrying it a step further my
right honourable friend from Eganville (Right
Hon. Mr. Graham) would make it possible to
achieve the purpose we have in view. That
purpose is to have the total indebtedness of
the railway te the country shown on the railway's balance sheet. If that were done, the
annual balance sheet would be a reminder to
our people of the crushing weight of the Canadian National upon the Dominion. I should
be quite willing to accept my right honourable friend's amendment if he would be good
enough to insert, after the word "equity," the
following words and figures:
representing an aggregate indebtedness of
$1,334,567,414.
If this insertion were made, the balance
sheet would not be changed, but the reminder
would be there. Every citizen who saw the
balance sheet with such a footnote on it would
feel it his duty, I hope, to insist that our
railway problem be settled. It should have
been settled a long time ago.
I have the honour to move the following
amendment to the amendment:
That after the word "equity' in the amendment, the following be inserted: "representing
an aggregate indebtedness of $1,334,567,414."
The amendment, if so amended, would then
read:
A footnote shall appear in the said accounts
stating that the proprietor's equity, representig
an aggregate indebtedness of $1,334,567,414, is
disclosed in the net debt of Canada and in the
historical record of governient assistance to
railways as shown in the public accounts of
Canada.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: May I ask the
honourable gentleman how he arrives at those
figures?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: They are taken from
the statement furnished by the Government
and attached to the Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There need
be no question as to the figures. I feel sure they
are correct, but, if net, they can be corrected.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask the
honourable senator a question?
Are those
figures not now published in two places, in
the public accounts and in the railway's
report? Are they not duplicated now?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am quite
sure these figures are riglit, but if the leader
of the Government questions their accuracy
I shall be very glad to accept bis figures.

APRIL 8, 1937
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Certain figures are
given on page 15A of the Bill. Are these
figures ot now included in the public accounts
cf Canada aod also in the annual report cf
the Canadian National?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In the new
balance sheet of the Canadian National the
proprîetnr's equity is placed at a certain
amount, but this is merely a bookkeeping
figure to represent the stock we are taking in
the Securities Trust. That Securities Trust,
though, holds goveroment dlaims against the
railway. What we want is the aggregate cf
those claims, and I arn willing to take whatever figure the leader cf the Goveroment says
is right. I believe that the figure given for
1935 was $1,363,000,000, which figure I used
yesterday. But here are some detai ,led figures
as I 00W find the.m. In the Canadian Natiooal's balance sheet as at December 31, 1936,
the proprietor's equity is showo as $676,327,701. That figure is showo in 'appendix No.
5, page 14A cf the Bill. In appendix No. 6,
page 15A, the amount written off by Bill 12
is $373,823,120. The loans previously written
off, !as at page 18 of the Canadian National
Railways report, was $284,416,593. The total
of these last two figures is $658,239,713. That,
taken with the arnount cf the proprietor's
equity, makes an aggregate cf $1,334,567,414.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Will the right hionourable gentleman state just what ia meant
by those Ioans that have been written off, as
showo in the Canadiao National's statement?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If the hionourable senator will wait until I can get the
Canadian National's report, I shaîl give the
information as stated there.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honcurable senators, evidently the point I amn making has
been misunderstood. Are ont these figures
00W being published twice-once in the public
accounts of Canada and once in the Canadian
National's annual report? Aod have they
ot been su published for yeairs?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Certaioly they are
shown in both places. To one instance there
is a credit item and in the other instance a
debit item. It is oonly natural that the figure
ahould be refiected in both staternents.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: As a debt?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: As money advanced
in ýone case and mo-ney received in the other
case. Caîl it a subsidy if you like. It is
money paid out by the treasury of Canada on
the one aide, and received by the railway on
the other.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Tens of thousands
of Canadien citizens who becorne aware of

this discussion here will say that the Government brought down a Bill to place the Canadian National Railways on a reasonably sane
competitive basis. No one would dreanm of
suggesting that the great railway which comnpetes with the Canadian National should show
on its balance sheet fromn year to year the
sums that in the past have been advanced to.
it. My honourable f riend knows, as everyone
else here knows, that millions upon millions
cf advances were shown with respect to that
great railway in days gone by, but they are
no longer shown. Tens cf thousands of Canadians will say-I amrn ot saying it-that we
,are -ony undertaking to perpetuate the record
of these advances on the Canadian National's
balance sheet for the purpose of belittling and
preiudicing the present and future operating
position of that publicly owned system.
How
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAtTNTON:
would that prejudice it?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: In this way. Gentlemen throughout the length and breadth of
Canada who do ot like public ownership, who
do ot like the Canadian National and have
neyer been disposed to give it an oppnrtunity
to break even, for to show what it cao do
under public ownership and control, want to
be able always to point to the horrors of these
advances to the Canadian National, with its
deficits of $100,000,000 every year. It would
o douht please a considerable number of hionourable gentlemen in this House and elsewhere
if wc were to hand the Canadian National over
to anme other body to-mnrrnw for one dollar.
Yet, if we did that, Canada would still have
to pay out $100,000,000Hon. Mr. TANNER: The only member of
Parliament who ever stated what the honourable gentleman is saying was a Liberal member
nf the other House. I want to say to my
-honourable friend that hie has stated something
which, with his knowledge, hie ought to knnw

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I certainly shaîl be

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: My honourable
friend said a moment ago that what I had
stated was unfounded and untrue. Mr. Speaker,
I respectfully call that to your attention as
being a statement which is out of order and
one which should be withdrawn before I proceed.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

The Hon. the SPEAKER: I am quite sure
the honourable member from Pictou (Hon.
Mr. Tanner) will accept the word of the
honourable member from Parkdale, and, if he
made that statement, will withdraw it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The statement referred to by the honourable member
from Parkdale, which the honourable member
from Pictou described as unfounded and untrue, was a statement as to opinions and desires of members of this House.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Certainly.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This is a
statement of which they are just as good
judges as he is.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: He had no right to
make accusations against us.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If anyone
says I have a certain view, and I say that is
untrue. he cannot make me withdraw my
remark.
Hon. Mr. TANNER:

I will not withdraw.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I would net for a
moment say that my honourable friend was
stubborn in declining to withdraw. But the

their action because of the fact, brought so
forcibly before us yesterday, that the Canadian National Railway System is costing the
people of Canada $100,000,000 a year. My
honourable friend has not admitted, but I
am sure he would admit, that the Canadian
National Railways would continue to cost
us $100,000,000 a year for many years to come
if to-morrow we unloaded it entirely.
Hon. J. A. McDONALD (Shediac): By
what alchemy of crooked understanding does
the honourable gentleman prophesy that any
company taking over the railway would continue to lose $100,000,000 a year?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I did not say that.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD (Shediac): Did I
misunderstand the honourable gentleman?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Yes. I said if the
Canadian National Railway System were tomorrow turned out of the hands of the
Canadian people, they would still have to put
up about $100,000,000 a year on account of
the railway situation.
Hon.
Mr. McDONALD
(Shediac):
I
thought the honourable gentleman said if the
Canadian National Railway System were
handed over te any other company it would
still lose $100,000,000 a year. I accept his
explanation.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: So it seems to
me there are some things which my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) should
explain further. I understood him to include
in his sub-amendment a figure of $1,334,000000
odd.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Will the honourable member from Parkdale allow me a
moment? We all have great respect for and
confidence in the present Government. We
are simply asking it to follow a practice
always followed by large corporations. Having made a change in the balance sheet, they
draw their shareholders' attention to it in a
footnote showing what the change amounts
to. A corporation would be compelled by the
Companies Act and by its board of directors
to do that. Surely the Government will not
object to it.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I accept the statement of the honourable gentleman from Alma.
Now let me ask him this question: Is the
Canadian National Railway System not a
subsidiary corporation of the Canadian Government?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
is nothing of the kind.

No;

it

APRIL 8, 1937
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: What about the
system of canais throughout the length and
breadth of Canada?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
The
Canadian National is not a subsidiary of the
Governme'nt.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Is it flot a subsidiary corporation?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: No. The
Canadian National is not a subsidiary; it is
a principal corporation, of which the Government owns the stock.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: With one hundred
and twenty subsidiaries.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
The
C-anadian National bas subsidiaries, but the
Canadi:an Government has no subsidia-ies.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: If that is the
case, I cannot understand why my honourable
friend wants a consolidated balance sheet for
the Canadian National Railways.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I do flot
want a consolidated balance sheet; the Government wants it.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The fact remains,
and I want to impress it again upon my
honourable friend on the opposite side, that
there are tens of thou.sands of persons in
Canada who are saying this is only a further
attempt to belittle and distress the people's
railway.
Hon. Mr. BALLA NTYNE: Not at all.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That is what they
will say, whether it is so or flot. I arn quite
sure we shaîl have additional speeches before
Canadian Clubs in different parts of CanadaAn H-on. SENATOR: And in, Liberty.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: -and in Libertystressing the view that has been so ably put
forward by my honourable friend who moved
this suli-amendinent. Personally, it will not
make mucli difference to me what is done
with this Bill, but I do think that in this
year 1937 we ought to begin to play reasonably fair with the Canadian National Railway System-the people's railway-and not
be continually trying to belittle and distress it.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: And play fair
with the taxpayers.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
My honourable
friend from Alma is only putting up a smokescreen when lie taîks of playing fair with
the taxpayers.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: And the
lionourable gentleman is threshing threshed
straw.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: My honourable
friend from Hamilton must always speak
when a thouglit cornes into bis head. If lie
would only wait until the member who lias
the floor sits down, it would be very mucli
appreciated.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:

All riglit.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The honourable
senator from Aima talks about playing fair
witb the taxpayers. The taxpayers are obligated
to spend about $100,000,000 a year, no matter
wliat happens.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:

I deny that.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I understood my
honourable friend to admit it yesterday.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: No. The record will
show. There is every year a deficit of about
$50,0O0,O00. 1 suppose if we sold the Canadian National Railway System, the acquiring
corporation would bear the deficit; otherwise
Canada certainly would flot selI the system.
No Government would enter into a transaction
that did not so provide. It would be ridiculotis on its face. Therefore if the railway were
sold, $50,000,000 a year would be borne by the
acquiring corporation.
Hon. Mr,. MURDOCK: The balance sheet
of the Canadian National Railways shows
assets to the extent of $1,361,00,000. We
could liardly expect to get that for the system
if we sold it to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: We could not get it.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: No, we could not.
But even if we did get it, we should still
have to take ýcare of an obligation of about
$100O,0000.
Therefore it is just talking to
the wind to say that if we unlo'aded the Canadian National Railway System we could
relieve ourselves entirely of the burden
brouglit to us by the acquisition of the railways now forming the National System.
That is ahl I have to say, but I think it
proper to caîl a spade a spade in regard to
some of the opposition to the Canadian
National Railways that lias been in evidence
for many years.

That after the word "equity" there be inserted the words "representing an aggregate
indebtedness of $1,334,567,414.'

Is it your pleasure, honourable members, to
adopt the amendment to the amendment?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators, this gives me an absolutely new lease of
life.
Hon. Mr. O'CONNOR: You bave spoken
three or four times.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Order. I have
just put the amendment to the amendment.
It is only fair that the mover of the amendment to the amendment should have the floor.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I just want to ask
if my honourable friend thinksHon. Mr. ROBINSON: Is the honourable
gentleman closing the debate?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I am speaking on
the amendment to the amendment.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I thought the honourable gentleman had already spoken.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The honourable
senator from Montarville will proceed.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: What I am asking
to add to the statement is the truth and nothing but the truth. We ought not to be blamed
for saying what is the truth.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Sometimes that
is the worst offence.
The Hon. the SPEAKER.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I,t will take all my
honourable friend's (Hon. Mr. Murdock's) ingenuity to turn that into an attack on the
Canadian National Railways. Until he rose
and spoke no honourable member had the
slightest thought that what we were asking
for was something to discredit the Canadian
National Railways.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: So you say.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: But my honourable
friend from Parkdale saw the advantage of
imputing to us that sinister motive. I leave
the public to judge between us. All we are
asking is that the real position of the Canadian National Railway System be presented,
and kept before the public. We do not wish
to go beyond that. Certainly it would be belittling the people who support my idea to impute to them an intention to attack a property
which is our own, and for which surely we
pay enough to appreciate its value.
Hon. FRANK P. O'CONNOR: Honourable
senators, my whole thought in this matter is:
Oan we not admit losses and write them off?
I think that applies not only to the Canadian
National Railways, but also to every honourable senator. I have heard the question asked
many times, even by the right honourable
leader opposite, " What difference does it
make?" I repeat -that question and add: Why
can we not comply with the request of the
Government to write off $1.300,000,000? That
is all it is asking. We have all had losses
and written them off. I think we should
comply with the Government's request.
Hon. GEORGE GORDON: Honourable
members, I think the honourable senator from
Parkdale unwittingly did an injustice to the
Canadian National Railways. He said that in
the event of the system being sold to-morrow
Canada would still have to carry $100,000,000
of deficits.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Approximately.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Approximately $100,000,000. It
is admitted, then, that the
tangible assets of the railway company are
worth nothing. If the Government were
entering into negotiations with a company
to buy this road, I am sure one of the conditions demanded by the buyer would be that
he would net be responsible for the carrying
of the debt.
It has been said, and truly, that no property
which is losing money every year has any
value.

A great many people forget that this

road has a value, and that it would have a
great value if the Government could succeed

APRIL 8, 1937
in getting a corporation to buy it. But after
it had been purchased those who had acquired
it would do many things which cannot be done
under public ownership.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: They would scrap
two-thirds of the mileage, for instance.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Exactly. Much of
the mileage would be scrapped-thrown away.
Furthermore, many expenses would be avoided
which cannot be avoided by a publicly owned
institution.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Does the honourable gentleman think that anyone who was
going to purchase the Canadian National
Railways and scrap two-thirds of the mileage
would pay anything for the mileage that was
to be scrapped?
Hon. Mr. GORDON: No, he would not.
It is quite correct to say he would put no
value on that at all; but the remaining onethird must have a value. If there were such a
sale Canada would then be carrying '$100,000,000 a year less, whatever it got for the road.
I submit that if the time is not already here
to do something of that nature, it is very
near. If things continue as they are, how
long is Canada going to be able to pay this

$100,000,000 a year?

But that is getting away from the point so
far as this Bill is concerned. I feel that it
makes no difference whether a billion is
written off or not. The country is going to
be no richer or no poorer as a result. The
same is true of the railway. The only thing
I fear from this legislation is the effect it may
have on certain organizations and certain
people who, if they thought the railroad was
making money, would come down here with
requests and demands for branch lines and
other expenditures. If this footnote will prevent them from doing that, it is in my
opinion worth while. For my part I am not
particular whether it goes in or not, nor am I
much concerned about whether the Bill passes
or not.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
we seem to be getting away frorn the matter
under discussion. The question of the sale
of the Canadian National Railways does not
come within the purview of the Bill at all.
As far as I am concerned, I may say that I am
not in favour of the sale of those railways,
and am not prepared to discuss such a matter.
Furthermore, I do not think honourable members on either side have the disposal of the
road in mind at the present time. Therefore I think we should confine ourselves to
what is involved in the Bill before us.

Hon. A. C. HARDY: Honourable senators,
I believe the two leaders of the House have
made a very earnest endeavour to reconcile
the differences of opinion that have prevailed
during the last few days in connection with
this balance sheet. As I am not a business
man, I have found it very difficult to analyse
such a tremendous document. If I understand correctly, the difficulty in the first place
seemed to lie in the fact that one party in the
Senate desired to attach a certain schedule,
by way of a footnote or otherwise, to the
balance sheet, whereas the other party did not
want that done. The two leaders have now
got to the point where it is agreed that a
footnote shall be made, and one side proposes
that it should set up this amount of some
s1,300,000,000, while the other side declines
to accept such a proposal.
Now, it seems to me that if the $1,300,000,000 is to be mentioned in the footnote we
might just as well have the whole schedule.
I do not see a particle of difference between
the two proposals. I cannot help feeling that
the statements the Canadian National Railways have been making for a great number of
years have had a considerable effect on the
Canadian people. We know that the balance
sheet has been used from ocean to ocean by
the protagonists of amalgamation with the
C.P.R. and the antagonists of public ownership. I may say that as far as railways are
concerned I am not a public ownership man;
but our railways are a matter of history, and
there is no use in discussing that question.
My right honourable friend (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) said in the House yesterday
that in recent times the people of Canada
were much more inclined to accept absorption
by the Canadian Pacific Railway than they
were a few years ago. It is just such propaganda as has been brought about by this
balance sheet that has been responsible for
that change of faith. There is throughout
Canada a growing conviction, and it has prevailed for many years, that the Senate of
Canada has never been sympathetic iii any
way whatever to the Canadian National Railways. I would not go so far as to say that
the majority in the Senate have at all times
blocked the Canadian National Railways, but
they have been very unsympathetic towards
them and have done nothing for them. I
would not say they have left nothing undone
to thwart them, but they have put themselves
in the position of giving no assistance by way
of sympathy and co-operation. I say that is
a growing conviction, and I challenge anyone
to deny it.
I feel that to put a figure in the footnote
is entirely unnecessary. If we are going to do

340

SENATE

that, we might as well have the schedule;
and I think we are agreed that that is not
desirable.

Hon. Mr. HARDY: We know that without
the usual guarantee of the Government, which
must be given, not a dollar could be raised.

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: I have
listened very carefully to the honourable member from Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy), and I
think if he will follow me and give his intellect free rein he will change his view.
Parenthetically, I may say that we have not
given up the idea .that a schedule is desirable; I think it is; but we have yielded on
that point.
Now we are at this stage. The Government are ready to include a footnote to the
balance sheet stating merely that the details,
the particulars as to the holdings in the way
of claims against the railway in this Securities Trust-in other words, the total amount
it has taken over, which is now written down
to the figure in the balance sheet-will be
found in the public accounts; but the Government are not prepared to say that the total
ainount is $1,334,000,000. They know it is
as much as that. If they say it is a different
amount, I will take their figure.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Therefore
the fellow who is going to invest does not
need a footnote at all. He does not need to
look at the public accounts. He knows the
record of Canada for the payment of its
debts. But the casual reader is going to see
that that figure in the balance sheet has been
reached by the writing off of a certain
amount. Why not tell him what the amount
is? It takes only an inch to do so. Those
who say, "Do not tell him; just save the
knowledge," have to admit, if they are logical, that they hope he will not look it up.

Hon. Mr. IING: They state it in the public
accounts.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, but they
will not state it in that footnote. What is the
difference? The difference, if any, is this.
The Government think that the fellow who
reads that footnote without a total will not
look at the public accounts. If they thought
the casual reader would look up the public
accounts they would not put in the footnote
either.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: He would do that if
he was interested.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Very good.
But why tell a fellow that if he will look at
the public accounts he will find something,
yet be afraid to tell him what he will find?
It takes only an inch.
Hon. Mr. HARDY:

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Is the honourable member not admitting that the Government harbours the hope that he will not look
at the public accounts?
Hon. Mr. HARDY: No. There is not an
underwriter who would put in a dollar without
reading the public accounts.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Still less
would he be willing to do it after reading
them. I should like to see anybody approach

No; that is not

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is the
point. I do not say it is a big one, but
there it is. Let honourable gentlemen take
sides on that issue.
Hon. C. W. ROBINSON: I should like
te say just one or two words on this subject.
To my mind this is not a matter of policy
at all, but one of accounting, which has
been presented to us by capable and competent auditors whose explanation we have
heard. Surely they are the ones who know
best how to make up a statement of accounts.
I think they have presented a true picture
of the railway situation, and if we are going
to give them expert advice on how these
accounts should be made upRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is not
the point at all.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I do not think it
is our business at all. That is my point. I
think we should accept the Bill as introduced, and make no amendments at all. We
have no more right to amend the Bill than
a builder has to tell the architect of a fine
building, "You have to put a pig's head on the
front of it to show where the bacon comes
from." Why should we spoil a good structure by saying what shall be added to it?
I tbink we should accept the Bill as introduced, and make no amendments.

Hon. SENATORS:

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
I have
been following this discussion with the intention of saying a few words on the subamendment.
My right honourable friend
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) asks why, when
we are suggesting the main amendment, we
are not ready to accept the sub-amendment.
I will tell him very candidly. Like my honourable friend from Moncton (Hon. Mr.

APRIL 8, 1937
Robinson), I did not feel that there was any
necessity for a footnote or any explanation
linking up the balance sheet of the Canadian
National Railways with the public accounts
of Canada. We were dealing only with the
statement of the Canadian National. But my
right honourable friend was so insistent upon
the necessity of hiding nothing from the world,
more especially from the Canadian taxpayer,
and was so urgent that we should meet him
to a certain degree, that after looking at clause
11 of the Bill, which states:
The accounts of the National Railway System shall be stated as of January first, nineteen hundred and thirty-seven, and thereafter,

gate amount whidh has been spent by the
Government on behalf of the Canadian National be set before the eyes of the people
on the railway's balance sheet. I reply that
the insertion of that amount in the footnote
would be of no avail as propaganda. The balance sheet of the Canadian National, like
other documents of the kind, is made for
people who can read balance sheets. I wonder how many men in Canada who call themselves business men can read a balance sheet.
I have known many executives end met at
board meetings many directors who were not
much more skilled in the reading and analysing
of a balance sheet than I was. In the course
of years I have learned something about this
subject. I do not accept for one minute the
opinion that the mass of our people would be
affected by what is shown in the Canadian National's balance sheet.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Hear, hear!
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I say we should
not darken that balance sheet with the intention that some day the people of Canada shall
become alarmed and declare, " We have spent
enough." I believe we are all trying to work
for the best advantage of Canada. Therefore
I appeal to my right honourable friend (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) not to insist on this matter
of propaganda against the Canadian National,
for such action might indicate that be and his
friends had some ill-will against this publicly
owned railway. I urge honourable members
to support the orthodox basis of accounting
for the Canadian National and not to seek the
insertion of propaganda in a balance sheet, as
my honourable friend from Montarville has
said he wants donc.
I have done my best to study the situation
which has arisen through the proposal to insert in the footnote the amount of the Government's aggregate expenditures upon the railway, $1,334,000,000-a proposal which may not
seem of much importance when stated in black
and white. It was my duty to ask my colleagues to what extent they considered the inclusion of this item would affect the balance
sheet, and I may say my conviction is that my
honourable friend's amendment to the amendment would not be accepted by the other
House. Therefore I ask him not to cause us
to make what I think would be a useless gesture, the sending over of the Bill with that
blur on it.
Hon. DONALD SUTHERLAND: Honourable members, I have listened very carefully to the debate on this question. So far
I have not had much to say about the Bill,
either in the House or in committee, but
I cannot refrain from commenting upon the
remarks of the honourable leader of the GovSon. Mr. DANDURAND.

ernment to the effect that the purpose behind
the desired insertion of this aggregate indebtedness in the footnote to the railway's
balance sheet is the spreading of propaganda
with a view to injuring the Canadian National's credit. The Canadian National Railways are a conglomeration of a number of
railway companies. To my mind the railway
situation in Canada is nothing short of a
tragedy. The appalling drain on this country
from year to year because of the Canadian
National's deficits will have to be faced in the
near future, or else a very serious situation
will develop.
When the great Transcontinental railway
was launched, back in 1903 or 1904, the prediction was made that the actual cost to
Can'ada in connection with that road from
ocean to ocean, from a sea port on the Pacific
to one in the Maritimes and up through the
northern part of Ontario and Quebec, would
be somewhere around $13,000,000.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would my honourable friend allow me a remark? Some day
I shall inform the Senate as to my share of
responsibility for the building of the Transcontinental. But just now will my honourable
friend permit me to point out to him that the
Transcontinental was built by the Canadian
Government from Winnipeg to Quebec, and
then pressed on to Moncton? My responsibility, which I frankly admit, was to have Sir
Wilfrid Laurier build the line from Winnipeg
to Quebec, but our friends from New Brunswick and the rest of the Maritimes insisted
that the road should go beyond that point.
The figure of $13,000,000 was the interest
which would have to be paid upon the cost.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. SUTHERLAND:
members, I quite appreciate what my honourable friend says about the construction
of that portion of the Transcontinental to
Winnipeg. Construction of the Grand Trunk
Pacific was undertaken by the Grand Trunk
Railway, or at least a contract to that effect
was entered into. But even with respect to
the section from the Maritimes to Winnipeg,
is it not most remarkable that a prediction
should have been made that the actual cost
to the people of Canada would be somewhere
between thirteen and fourteen million dollars?
That prediction was placed on record time
and time again. To-day we are asked to forget expenditures totalling $1,300,000,000, which
have been absolutely lost to the people of this
country through our blundering in connection
with railways. Yet my honourable friend the
leader of the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
is a little sensitive about the figure of $13,000,000 which I quoted. Let me say right
here that that sum would not in fact repre-

APRIL 8, 1937
sent more than about two-thirds of the cost
of bridging a river in connection with the
building of the Transcontinental.
So far I have not mentioned any names,
but I will mention one now. The Toronto
Globe of October 5, 1904, contains a speech
which the then Prime Minister, Sir Wilfrid
Laurier, delivered in Toronto. In that speech
he said:
I will not bore you with figures; I will give
you the figures compiled by the experts of the
Finance Department, who calculate that what
we would pay in interest for seven years represents a sum in cash which, if it were put in
the bank to-day, would amount to a little more
than $13,000,000, and a little less than $14,000,000. That is all we would have to pay for the
construction of the road if our expectations
and contracte prove to be as accurate as we
think they are. I ask you, my fellow-citizens,
if we can get that tremendous railway for
$14,000,000 do you think that will be so very
heavy a burden for the Canadian taxpayers,
when I tell you that the surplus we had in
the year 1902-3 was $14,000,000-(cheers) -and
last year, 1903-4, it was $15,000,000?
This is
the project I have to lay before you, this
scheme and plan of the Government. (Cheers.)
We desire to record what is a matter of
history, but my honourable friend the leader
of the Government says, "Why, it is propaganda." It is nothing of the kind. It is a
reminder to the people of Canada of the
tremendous blunders made in the past, and
we hope that reminder will act as a safeguard
against the repetition of such blunders in
the future. It is immaterial who owns the
transportation system of this country, but I
foresee the day when it will be a question,
not of disposing of the National System to
some other company, but of abandoning many
miles of railway that should never have been
constructed.
One of the most colossal blunders this
country ever committed was in connection
with railway construction. My earliest recollection on this goes back to 1902, when I was
a member of the Ontario Legislature. Railway
promoters at that time were seeking land
grants, bonuses, subsidies, and guarantees,
and I remember the specious pleas put forward
by the Government to justify assistance. The
people accepted those statements as correct.
And we all know the enormous sums of money
and extensive tracts of land which the Dominion Government and the provinces granted
'to promote these transcontinental railways.
Let me warn honourable members that if all
this debt of the Canadian National Railway
System is forgotten so that the system appears
to have an operating surplus, the day is not
far distant when those who are supporting
this Bill will be on our necks again for
increased wages.
An Hon. SENATOR:

They are here now.

343

Hon. Mr. SUTHERLAND: My honourable
friend says they are here now.
A few years ago the then Chairman of the
Railway Commission, Hon. F. B. Carvell,
looked into this matter very fully. When in
Victoria in 1921 he referred to the increase in

railway wages which had occurred about that
time. This country was in the greatest straits
I suppose it was ever in. He said it was
found necessary, in order to keep the railways
in operation, to meet the demands of certain
slick gentlemen who came from south of the
border line.
Hon. Mr. O'CONNOR: Speak for yourself.
Hon. Mr. SUTHERLAND: I will quote
Mr. Carvell's statement, which appeared in
the Ottawa Journal of that date:
Discussing our railway problems while travelling in his official capacity, the chairman expiained by saying the board's award of increased
freight rates had evoked criticism. " Consequently," he said, "we are going to give the
public the truth about the railway situation."
The. McAdoo award, he said, was given to
Canadian railway workers, not because it
affected Canada, but because "slick gentlemen
from the States had journeyed up to Canada
and threatened that they would call a strike
in this country if the award was not given
to Canadian workers. It was difficult to imagine
anything," he thought, "more humiliating than
that labour leaders in the United States should
be able to hold a pistol to our heads."
The following night he spoke in Victoria
along the same lines.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In what year
was that?
Hon. Mr. SUTHERLAND: In 1921. He
acknowledged that his action in discussing the
railway problem in public was open to possible
cri-ticism, but he repeated his belief that his
plain duty lay in informing the public fully
on the matter. The public were facing the
problem then, just as they are facing the
problem to-day, and Mr. Carvell said, "They
are entitled to know the facts." I think the
facts should appear on the balance sheet of
the railway system, so the people will really
know what has happened.
Let me quote from the statement which Mr.

Carvell made at Vancouver on the following
night. It will be found in the Canadian
Annual Review for 1921 at page 381. That
publication has a reputation for accuracy, and
therefore I do not think what I am about to

read will be questioned.

Under the heading,

"The Railways and the Freight Rates Question," I find the following:
The Commission and its associated railway
problems were much before the public in 1921;
the question of freight rates was one of. the
most conspicuous and difficult of these issues.
Mr. Carvell was very frank in his statements
and judgments; he expressed himself clearly

SENATE
and did not evade points of controversial character. The Railway Board visited the Western
centres in the spring of 1921 and heard various
appeals and statements as to freight rates;
outside of the Commission sittings, Mr. Carvell
continued his outspoken utterances. Speaking
to the Canadian Club at Brandon on April 22,
lie described the railway problem as more important than the tariff or any other question
before the people: "It cost $40,000,000 more
to run the C.N.R. last year than was brought
in, and that is no reflection on the people at
the head of the railways or on the Government.
The Canadian National is a conglomeration of
a lot of railways that couldn't run themselves
and, therefore, had to be taken over by the
Government, and if anyone thinks the Government, or any man, can take over these roads
and turn them into a dividend-paying proposition in a year or so, he is much mistaken."
At Victoria on April Il he told the Canadian Club that freight rates on Canadian railways were too high; that in many cases they
were having an adverse effect upon business;
that under existing circumstances and the McAdoo and Chicago wage awards this could not
be helped; that to force the railways to meet
increased costs of operation without the privilege
of raising rates or power of lowering wages
would be to force the roads against the wall;
that the financial stabilitv of the C.P.R. was
as important to the country as good government. He deelared that the root of tbe trouble
was in pay-rolls forced upon this country by
political agitation and labour efforts in the
United States; that "the action of American
labour men in putting a pistol to the head
of the Canadian railway companies and demanding tiat the new American wage scale,
fixed under the Chicago award, be matie effective in Canada, placed the railway companies
in a most humiiliating position."
As to the future: "No matter what happens,
railway labour nust be reborn and ai hoinest
day's labour for an lonest day's pay must
be the first principle observed.
Canadian
labour is not responsible for the Mc Adoo award,
if it is not prepared te
but it is responsible
give honest service."
His view of the labour
situation aswas important because it could not
but affect the policy and decisions of the
Boarl; "There are engineers and conductors
to-day who are naking $4,000, $5,000 anid even
$6,000 a year as the result of the McAdoo
award: I an beginning to ie skeptical of the
advisability of having Canadian unions controlled in the United States."
Mr. Carvell was unceasing in his expression
of opinion along these lines.
Ie
told the

Kiawanis Club, Vancouver, on April 7, that:
"The people want lower freiglit rates, but
they will not permit us to eut off costly Siday trains. Next to the unneciessary train
services, the greatest factor in maintaining higi
rates are the wages ashich have to be paid as
the result of the McAdoo award of 1918. and
the Chicago award of July, 1920."
It is somewlat of a repetition of what he
stated the night before in Victoria, and he
made a similar statement later at Brandon.
The Canadian Anniual Review also quotes
a speech delivercd by the then Minister of
Railways in the House of Conmons on
December 31, 1918:
Hon. Mr. SUTHERLAND.

The Minister stated that the wage bill, owing
largely to the McAdoo award, was $73,000,000,
so that ont of every dollar earned by the railways seventy-eigit cents passed in wages to
the employees.
Honourable members, I have placed these
matters on record lest my silence on the
charge that our amendment to this Bill is
simply propaganda might be misconstrued.
I repeat, our amendment is nothing of the
kind. This question is one of the most important this country has ever had to deal
with. It must be dealt with firmly, let the
chips

fall

where

they

may.

The

people

have to-day a better railway system than
they ever had in the past, and if we have to
abandon miles of railway, let it be done, and

done quickly. What would be the use in
putting off the evil day for a few years? We
know full well the situation is going to become worse rather than better. As every
honourable senator must feel, the situation
is bound to grow worse before it can be
dealt with. For that reason I believe that
this amendment is reasonable in every respect, and I hope it will be pressed to a vote,
if necessary.
As a member of the Railway Committee I
was net only surprised, I was astonished at
the attitude of the Minister in regard to
the matter.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Question!
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Ilonourable senators, I think that befo.re the question is put
I should say a word. I am net going to
deal with the railway situation in the sligltest degree. We have only the one point before us for consideration, and that is whether
or not there should be a footnote to the
balance sheet, and, if so, what its nature
should be. Personally I am inclined to think
we have wasted a great deal of time over
a very small matter. It is admitted that in
so far as the investor is concerned, it makes
no difference what is in the balance sheet:
the investor depends upon the security of the
Canadian Covernment. He has the guarantee of the Government to repay the principal and to pay the interest annually when
it is due, and that is all he wants.
Only one difficulty has been experienced.
so far as I understand the situation, and
that was with the American Securities Commission, who ran up against a complication
in cosnneetion with tise dupliiating of items
in the Canadian National balance sheet and
the Dominion Government accounts. That
simsply ial to be straightened out under
American law in order that the necessary prospectuses or statements might be issued to
the public who were te buy the securities

APRIL 8, 1937
I do not know whether such a situation exists in London or not, but we all know it
exists in the United States. No foreign government or no foreign person can put securities on the American market without obtaining the authority of the American Securities Commission; consequently it ias been
desirable to straighten out the situation that
gave trouble in that respect.
Now, as to the purchase of bonds of the
Canadian National Railway System, I repeat that it does not make the slightest
difference to the purchaser what is in the
balance sheet. So far as the public of Canada are concerned, I take the view that
the people of Canada who in future will
desire to increase the indebtedness of the
Canadian National Railways will not pay
the slightest attention to the balance sheet.
If there are any communities in Canada that
wish to have expenditures made in connection with the railway system, they will be
very little concerned about what is in the
balance sheet. If they want something in the
shape of a new railway, a new building, or
anything else which involves capital expenditure, they will insist upon having it. In
the last analysis there is only one body that
can control expenditures. The balance sheet
will never do it at all. Ninety per cent of
those who read the balance sheet will not
understand it. In the last analysis the question whether or not there shall be any further
expenditure on the Canadian National Railways will depend, entirely upon Parliament.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will go further
and say, more especially upon the Senate of
Canada.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: To a very large extent.
I was coming to that. It must first depend
upon the Minister in control of the railway
situation, who is the first person appealed to.
He must go to the Minister of Finance; the
two of them must go to Council; and Council
must come to Parliament. When the matter is
submitted te Parliament it comes to this House
as well as to the House of Commons. So the
question of further expenditures in connection
with this railway system depends entirely upon
the ability, the common sense, the integrity,
the faithfulness to public duty, and all such
qualities of the members of Parliament, and
net, I repeat, on a balance sheet, no matter
what is in it. You have on the one side the
possible investor, the man who wants to buy,
and on th3 other side you have the man who
wants to increase expenditures. As I say, in
my judgment the balance sheet makes no difference in either case.
Having said that, I must say further-and I
say it frankly-that I had intended to vote

345

for the Bill as it came from the committee,
mainly for the reasons I have just stated. However, there are those on this side of the House
who have the viewpoint that we are not dealing
with a balance sheet alone-that this is not
purely a bookkeeping matter; and I appreciate
their viewpoint. Something has happened in
connection with our railways. Briefly, it is
this. We have poured into those railways the
su:m of over one billion dollars, which we are
now writing off, and all that the suggestion of
my colleague to. my right (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) meant-and there is a great deal to be
said in favour of it-is that at all tines the
people of Canada should clearly understand
what has been written off. It does not affect
the balance sheet one iota in relation to either
the public or the investor, but it is desirable
that there should appear before the people of
Canada a definite and clear statement of what
has been written off, which is now represented
by what we call the Securities Trust.
Now look at the position I am in. The Government, through its leader on the other side,
has seen fit to accept the idea that there should
be a footnote, and that that footnote in effect
should say: " There has been a great sum written off, and we have an equity. If you want
to find what that equity is, just look at the
public accounts." It seems to me there is
only one position I can take. In v.iew of the
very difficult situation that has existed I can
quite understand the action of the Government in proposing an amendment in the shape
of a footnote which says, in effect, to everybody
in Canada, " We have a large equity outside of
ah these liabilitites that appear, and if you
want to see it you will find it in the public
accounts of Canada."
Hon. Mr. KING: Where it should be.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes, where it should be.
But for the life of me I cannot understand,
when it goes so far, what possible harm it
thinks can be done by saying that the total
amount of that equity is so much, and letting
it rest there.
Now let me say-and I say it in all candour
-that I doubt very much whether this situation should have arisen. The point at issue
is not big enough; there is not enough at
stake to justify it. I trust that nothing will
happen that will kill this Bill. An occurrence
which would have that result is what I fear
most. I say again, and I stress it, that I
trust nothing will happen that will kill this
Bill.
Now let me say that I must vote for the
sub-amendment on account of the situation
which has arisen; and I would add that I do
not like the idea of a footnote at all. You can
see the position I am in. If the sub-amend-

46

SENATE

ment carries, it will go, I presume, to the
Commons, and probably four, five or six
heads will eventually gather around a table.
I trust they will be able to work things out
so that the Bill will continue to see the daylight.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask if all
honourable senators are not required to vote?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Not if they are paired.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The rule is that
a senator refraining from voting must state
his reason to the House, and then he is
excused if the House so declares.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I was paired with the
honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. McRae). Had I voted, I should have
voted against the amendment to the amendment.
The amendment, as amended, was agreed
to on the same division.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it your
pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the
motion for the third reading of the Bill, as
amended?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have hesitated
somewhat as to what should be my course,
since the Bill does not represent the present
views of the Government as I have expressed
them to this Chamber. However, with that
reservation, which is in the form of a protest,
I will not object to the Bill being sent to
the Commons.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill, as
amended, was read the third time, and passed.
UNEMPLOYMENT AND AGRICULTURAL
ASSISTANCE BILL
MOTION

FOR SECOND

READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 80, an Act to assist in
the alleviation of Unemployment and Agricultural Distress.
Honourable senators, this Bill
He said:
provides for the continuance of federal assistance to the provinces, and, through the provinces, to the municipalities, in their efforts to
deal with unemployment and agricultural distress. The present Unemployment Relief and
Assistance Act, 1936, expires, as no doubt
honourable senators are aware, on March 31
of this year. Although it is generally recognized that economic conditions have improved
considerably during the past year, and we
trust they are con-tinuing to improve, still
the improvement has not yet reached the
stage where federal assistance can be withdrawn.
This Bill is in terms very similar to the
present Unemployment Relief and Assistance
Act, and, like it, provides, first, for the initiation and carrying on by the Federal Government of works for the alleviation of unemployment and agricultural distress; second, for
fedeal assistance being extended as in the

347

APRIL 8, 1937
Iast few years to the provinces, under agreement with them, in their efforts to relieve
unemployment, and also to relieve the very
serjous conditions whieh have existed in certain
areas of the Prairie Provinces; third, for the
continuance of assistance by the Dominion to
the provinces by way of loans towards the
provinces' costs in connection with such
measures; and, fourth, there is a provision by
which the province is obliged to furnish the
Dominion from time to time with certified
statemen-ts as to its financial condition, in
such detail and in such form as the Dominion
may require, and to furnish such other information and permit such examînation and
audit to be made by the Dominion as may
appear to be necessary.
I move the second reading of this Bill,
seconded by the Right Hon. Mr. Graham.

ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED
BILL

POLICE

FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 83, an Act to amend the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: This Bill provides for the appointment, the calling up for training and duty,
and the payment of a certain number of men
as reserve constables, to be known as the
Roval Canadian Mounted Police Reserve. and
for the appointment from among such constailes of reserve non-commissioned officers.
It provides also that the time served in
the permanent forces of Canada may be included in the term of service of an officer or
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

constable for pension purposes. It provides
further that any person who ceases to be a
constable shall have the right to continue to
pay instalments of contributions for pension
purposes, or to withdraw all such contributions.
I think this explanation fairly well covers
the purposes of the Bill. I would ask my
right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen), if he bas perused the Bill, or, if
nat, my gallant friend sitting behind him
(Hon. Mr. Griesbach), to tell us whether
it meets with approval.
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH:
Honourable
members, the Mounted Police Act makes provision for the maintenance of a reserve. That
reserve was intended to be drawn fromn men
who had served their time in the force and
had retired to civil life. It has been found
that those men, after thirty years' service,
were a little too old for the particular work
which the reserve would b' called upon to
do. It was also found that men who had
done twenty-five or thirty years' service were
not very eager to join the reserve. So the
scheme failed more or less.
The purpose of the reserve is to permit of
expansion of the force on a fairly large scale
in time of civil riot, insurrection, and the
like.
The men desired are not necessarily employed in the detection of crime. They are
more likely to be used in some numbers
under the control of officers and non-commissioned officers of the Mounted Police, and
should be young and active. At the present
time there are sixty men mobilized in Toronto
for service in Ontario. This means that from
thirty to sixty jobs in hand will have to be
abandoned while those men are engaged in
that duty. Again, if, say, a disturbance arose
in the Western Provinces and another in the
Maritime Provinces, and we were without
a reserve. some difficulty would be experienced
in getting the requisite number of men
prompty on the scene.
This Bill repeals the provision for a reserve
composed of the old retired men and proposes beginning at the opposite end,
It
is a known fact that the waiting-list of the
Mounted Police comprises severai thousand
young men from twenty-two to twenty-six.
all eager to join the force. It is proposed
to enlist such men. give them two months'
training, and carry them on the reserve. using
the reserve to fill vacancies as they occur in
the permanent force. As a result there will
be a reserve of some three hundred young
men, active and fit, not perhaps qualified for
full police work. for the detection and prevention of crime, but sufficiently well trained to

APRIL 9, 1937
act, more or less en masse, under their own
officers.
Section 3 authorizes service in the permanent
forces and in the Civil Service to be counted
for purposes of pension. This is made necessary hy the expanding activities of the
Mounted Police in the last four or five years.
A number of men are being brought in from
the Civil Service in connection with various
formas of crime detection work, such as photography, finger-printing, and particularly
chemical analysis. They are used in the scientifie deteetion and prevention of crime. It
will be remembered that when the Mounted
Police took over the Customs Preventive
Service it absorbed from the Department of
National Revenue about a hundred men. Section 3 provides that the time which those
men served in the Civil Service shahl be
counted for purposes of pension when they
retire.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bihl
was read the second time.

NORTHERN PACIFIC RALIBUT F1511ERY (CONVENTION) BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from. the House
of Commons with Bihl 90, an Act respecting
a certain Convention hetween Canada and the
United States of America, for the preservation
of the Halibut Fishery of the Northern Pacifie
Ocean and Bering Sea, signed at Ottawa on
the 29th day of January, 1937.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hun. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of the Bill.
H1e said: Honourable senators, the object
of this Bill is to ratify a certain convention
between Canada and the United States for
the preservation of the halibut fishery. As
honourable members are aware, a halibut convention between the IUnited States and Canada
was agreed to in 1923. It was replaced by
a new one in 1930. The present convention
is largehy a re-enactmnent of the provisions of
the agreement of 1930, with some slight changes
in phraseology and two important amendments relating particularly to procedure. The
procedure under the 1930 arrangement was
discovered te permit of advantages being

gained by dishonest fishermen, to the detri.
men of fishermen honegtly complying with
ahl regulations. The International Fisheries
Commission recommended amendments to
overcome this handicap and suggested to hoth
governments that it would he preferable to
frame a new convention rather than simphy
amend the existing one. The few alterations in drafting do not in any way affect
the principle of the convention.- I shall give
in more concrete form an exact statement
of the two important amendments now proposed.
The experience gained by the International
Fisheries Commission during the years since
the 1930 convention came into force has disclosed certain defects in the existing procedure, and in its report to the two governments of January, 1936, the commission made
specîflo recommendations for new provisions
to reýmedy these defects. For this purpose
the commission submitted a draft of a new
convention. It was considered that a completely *new document, replacing -the present
one and incorporating the amendments, would
provie a more convenient procedure than the
conclusion of a supplementary convention.
After careful consideration the two government.s decided to adopt the commission 's
recommendations, and accordingly they signed
at Ottawa, on January 29 hast, the new convention whicha is set out in the scheduhe to
the Bill.
As recommended by the commission, this
1937 convention wilh, if ratified, supplant the
existing convention of 1930. This fohhows the
procedure of 1930, when the 1923 convention
was completehly replaced. The 1937 conventien incorporates, however, ahi the provisions
of the 1930 convention except to the extent
of the few amendments which, were recommended hy the commission.
It may be noted here that the commission,
upon consuhting the fishing fleets concerned,
found that they largehy urged the revision;
indeed the changes originated with the flshing fleets as being desirable to facilitate their
operations and the enforcement of the Iaw.
The amendments do not estahhish any new
principle. Their objet is, in two main partieulars where the commission has found results somewhat unsatisfactory, to improve the
carrying out of 'the originýal underhying purpose, namehy, the preservaition and extension
of this greut fishery. In other words, they may
be regarded -as amendments of administrative
procedure.
The first main amendment; concerns the circumstanice th-at during the chosed halibut season fishermen may, in hahihut areas, flsh for
other species of flsh and that in so doing they

350

SENATE

may incidentally catch some halibut. Under
the existing convention halibut caught incidentally in this manner may be retained and
used for food for the crew of the fishing
vessel; but any portion not so used must be
landed and turned over to the proper officers
of the two governments, which sell them to
the highest bidder and pay the proceeds into
the respective public treasuries, American and
Canadian. The commission has found that
since fishermen object to throwing away good
halibut caught in this manner-which is, in
fact, a waste of good fishHon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -there has been
considerable violation of the law. It also
appears that fishing for less valuable varieties
of deep sea fish, such as black cod and red
cod. would likely be encouraged if regulations
could be made to permit the fishermen under
certain conditions to retain such halibut as
may be caught incidentally. The commission.
in its report, sums this aspect up by stating:
The existing provisions are therefore, in
effect, penalties on the honest fisherman vithont restraining the dishonest, and are productive of wastage of needed food. when there
is no good reason why su.ch small quantities
of halibut, probably not exceeding 150,000
pounds for the wliole fleet, might not be made
legitimate, certainly durin the season when
halibut is being taken on other parts of the
coast.
Accordingly, as recommended by the commission, the retention by the fishermen of
halibut incidentally caught is being made
lawful, subject to such limitations and prohibitions as the commission may prescribe
with the approval of the two governments.
The new wording in this respect will be found
at the end of the second paragraph of article
I of the new convention.
The second main amendment concerns a
practical detail as to the method of fixing
the limits of the closed season. The convention in its general scheme lays down a certain closed season--from November 1 to
February 15-but gives the commission power,
subject to approval by the two governments,
to suspend or change this season. Under the
existing convention, however, it is possible
only to fix the date when halibut fishing must
cease in any year. The result is .that a vessel
may be out on the fishing bank with only a
part of its normal load taken when the
elosure date arrives. If fishing is stopped
then, the voyage will entail a loss to the
fishermen. while if the vessel remnains to fill
up, a violation of the law occurs. Halibut
vessels must leave port well in advance of
closure in order to reach the fishing grounds,
and after ceasing to fish they may take a week
Hon. Mr. DANDUR AND

or more in returning to port. The commission,
after pointing out that it is difficult to detect
law violations by patrol along a broken coast
of over two thousand miles, sums up its
opinion on this aspect as follows:
The present condition is again one that
penalizes the honest fisherman when there is
no need. There is again no reason why a full,
normal last trip cannot be allowed the honest
fisherman as well as the man who breaks the
law to get it. This cao be done by setting a
date for last departure for fishing in any area
whieh is to be elosed. As at present, this
date can be forecast approximately and warning
given in order that all may have equal opportunity to adapt their movements to it, but the
setting of such a date would allow a normal
trip for all vessels which have been in time
to depart.
Accordingly, as thus recommended, the new
convention, instead of authorizing the commission to fix a date for the cessation of
fishing, authorizes it periodically to fix a date
for the last departure of fishing vessels for any
fishing area concerned.
That su.mmarizes, I tibink, the effect of
amendments to the existing convention. The
Bill simply has the effect of ratifying the convention entered into on the 29th of January,
1937.
With these explanations, by leave of the
Senate, I move the second reading of the
Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: With the leave
of the Senate, I move the third reading of
this Bill.

SEED GRAIN LOANS GUARANTEE BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill 101, an Act to assist
the Provinces of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan in financing the cost of seed and
seeding operations for the crop year 1937.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable senators, the title of
the Bill discloses its purpose. It is to assist
the provinces of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan in financing the cost of seed and
seeding operations for the crop year 1937.
The Bill follows the lines of similar legislation of a year ago. There is the exception,
however, that this year the scope will be

351

APRIL 9,1937
extended to the provinces of Alberta and
Manitoba, after discussions and negotiations with the governments of those provinces. The guarantee by the Dominion of the
guarantee by the provinces of their municipalities witlh respect to seed grain loans
involves a rate of interest to the municipalities
of four per cent, and the provincial governments then arrange as to what the rate shall
be as between the municipalities and the farmers securing the seed.
As far as this Government is concerned,
the banks supply the money to the municipalities on the guarantee of the provinces, guaranteed in turn by the Dominion at four per
cent. The amounts named have been arrived
at after very careful examination by the federal Department of Agriculture of the representations of departments of agriculture in
the three Western Provinces. As to the term
of loan, provision is made that the guarantee
does not become effective, that is, the claims
under the guarantee cannot be made, for
three years after the granting of the loan.
This gives the farmers in the drought area
who secure seed a maximum of three crops
before the guarantees, either of the province or
of the Dominion, become effective.
It may interest the House to know, with
respect to the experience of last year, when
loans up to about $4,000,000 were authorized,
that no guarantee has been given by the
Dominion up to the present, owing to the
fact that the province has not yet been able
to supply the detailed information required.
Under the plan as it worked last year in
Saskatchewan sufficient repayments have been
made by the farmers to reduce the liability
as at the first of last month to $2,500,000.
It is expected that in connection with the
legislation of a year ago guarantee will be
required only up to $2,500,000 instead of up
to $4,000,000.
I believe that this, with a simple reading
of the Bill, will be a sufficient explanation.
I will read only one of the clauses, because it
is repeated for each of the three provinces.
The Governor in Council, subject to the
provisions of this Act, may authorize the
guarantee of the principal and interest of any
loans made by any chartered bank and guaranteed by the province of Alberta under the authority of the Agricultural Relief Advances Act of
Alberta and any amendments thereto, for purchasing seed grain and providing other assistance to farmers in connection with seeding
operations during the spring of 1937; provided
however that the aggregate principal amount
of oans guaranteed under the authority of this
section shall not exceed one million six hundred
thousand dollars.
I move the second reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

GOLD CLAUSES BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 103, an Act respecting
Gold Clause Obligations.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable senators have heard
considerable in recent years of the gold clause
obligations which bound the Dominion, the
provinces, the municipalities and other corporate institutions to pay their bonds in gold.
This Bill provides that debtors, including the
Dominion, the provinces and municipalities,
shall be discharged from any obligation to
pay debts in gold upon making payment in
currency of Canada. Perhaps I should content myself with reading the various sections,
which I think are sufficiently clear to need no
further explanation.
2. The expression "gold clause obligation" in
this Act means any obligation heretofore or
hereafter incurred (including any such obligation which has, at the date of the commencement of this Act, matured) which purports to
give to the creditor a right to require payment
in gold or in gold coin or in an amount of
money measured thereby, and includes any such
obligation of the Government of Canada or of
any province.
3. In the case of any gold clause obligation
payable in money of Canada, tender of currency of Canada, dollar for dollar of the
nominal or face amount of the obligation, shall
be a legal tender and the debtor shall, on making
payment in accordance with such a tender, be
entitled to a discharge of the obligation.
4. In the case of any gold clause obligation
governed by the law of Canada payable in
Canada or elsewhere, in money other than
money of Canada, tender of the nominal or
face amount of the obligation in currency which
is legal tender for the payment of debts in the
country in the money of which the obligation
is payable shall be a legal tender and the
debtor shall, on making payment in accordance
with such a tender, be entitled to a discharge
of the obligation.
5. Any payment in respect of a gold clause
obligation made before the commencement of
this Act, which, if made hereafter, would
entitle the debtor to a discharge, shall be
deemed to have discharged the obligation.
6. Every gold clause obligation is hereby
declared to be contrary to public policy and
no such provision shall hereafter be contained
in, or made in respect of, any obligation.
7. The provisions of this Act shall have full
force and effect notwithstanding anything contained in any other statute or law.

SENATE

The Bill gives effect to a principle embodied
in a judgrnent of the Privy Council concerning golci clause obligations.
Righit Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN:
Honourable senators, this is a measure which if
brought clown somte years ago, or even now
under different circumstances, wvould have
been regarded as horrifying in the oxtreme.
It prox ides that contracts made by goverfirnents or by citizens, payable in a certain
way, shaîl flot be so payable, but rnay be
dischiarged upon payment of Canadian currency. Nearly ail govcrnimental contracts
and corporation bonds-ail that 1 rernember
having rcad in detail-were payable in gold.
This Bill provides that every contract shaîl
be anmlled in respect of paymient in gold,
and that the debt so payable, if specified in
the contracr to bc payable in rnoney of Canada. shaîl be discharged upon payment of the
amount in Canadian curroncy.
Thiat is to
say. the amiount of the obligation shall be
cntircly %vipcd away if paid in Canadian eurrency. even thoughi the contract require the
Obligation to be paid in gold of a certain
weight and fineness.
There mnay be some question as to whether
in respect of prix ate contracts this Parliarnent
has the power to pass; sucli legislation. But
I do nlot sec that we cao do other than socle
to exercise such power, because verv ornînous
and <lifficult complications would otherwise be
bound to arise. I think we have to do this.
Nobody could be more opposed to legisiative
interfemence xvith ternis of a contract than
I arn. I regard legisiative sanction of the
validitv of contracts, and of obligations under
them,. as the xery sheet-anchor of civilization,
and I believe we are goin g downhill to the
extent that we militate against and dissipâte
the authority of contracts. Every situation
that faces us in respect of a contract, though,
mnust bo reg-arded in the lig-ht of the circumstances under whichi the contract was entcred
into. There are numerous cases where nocessities develop which mnust have sorne relation to the mind of the parties at the Limie of
the contract.
For examl)le, Great Britain, France, and
othor allied countries in the days of the War
borrowed heavily in the United States. There
had been many international borrowings prior
to that, but during the XVar borrowing was
dýone by the nation. not by its citizens, from
anotber nation. At the time ecrv sueh
contract was entered into the governmonts of
both nations knew fairly well that the obligation so assumed could ho discharged in one
way only. No matter how rieh -the country

another country sax o by selling goods. 'Neyer
in the history of civilization was an international debt discharged otherwise. You can
discharge internaI debts within the circumference of your own country in the coin of
your own country, but an international debt
cannot be discharged that way.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Can it flot be discliarged or redueed by the shipping of gold?
Rig-ht Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: Yes, but that
m a dis:charge by the shipping of goods of a
s
certain kind. You have to seîl material to
entitle yourself Lo coin of the country in
which yeu owe the rnoney. There is no other
way to get that coin. And, as every country
lcnew thon and knows to-day, nothing more
absurd could have been suggested than that
gold be moved in order that debtor nations
might get coin to pay their obligations, because
there was nothing like enough gold in the
world available to meet those obligations;
flot even a small fraction of the amount
necessary; and if but a tiny percentage of
that small available fraction had been moved,
the wholc international exchangýe situation
xvould bave been upset. Such circurnstances
must have been in the minds of borrowers
and lendors at the time these international
obligations wore incurred. Any nation ivhich
is given an opportinit.v to selI its goods and
pay its debts and at ans' tirne neglects or is
unwilling to do so loseýs its title to the respect
of the world frorn that hour on. But if a
nation is not given an opportunity and is
unable to geL iL. thiere is nothing it catn do,
becîiuse it is denicd a chance to pay iLs debt
in the on]lv way that an international dùbt
cani ho paid.
Now, sirnilar eonsiderations; corne in here.
M'len, y ears ago. the Province of Ontario,
or the Province of Quebcc, or the Dominion
of Canada. or sorne corporation. issued bonds
agremng to pay certain siims of mioney
rnea.sured in ternis of the currency of Canada. -and I0 pay it in a certain weight and
finencss of gold, it rnust have been known
that the ability so to pay depended upon
mnaintenanee of the gold parity, thoen existing.
There as no thoughit in the mind of horrower
o
or- lender that a for voster surn of gold would
hav e to ho paid thoan what was thon engaged
to ho paid. Since those contractis were entered
into gold bas becorne for more valuable,
becauise of conditions which seerned to nocessitate that governmnents declare it Lo ho more
valuable.
This condition has arisen flot
through onything done by parties to the contract, but by a force majeumre. Cold is flow
more diffheuit Lo geL.: govertiments have taken
control of it. Tho1refore I do flot regard it as

APRIL 9, 1937
a falling away from bonourable obligation to
say that the circumstances are wholly changed,
and that the sole intention in the minds of
the parties who made the contra-ct was that
the amount stipulated should be paid at the
parity of exehange then obtaining, and not
at some parity wbich afterwards obtained
because of forces far vaster and more powerfui than any witbin the control of those
parties. It seems to me that the main part
of the Bill is made necessary by events and
is not inconsistent with honour.
There is one part of the Bill, though, with
respect to which I am flot quite clear. Section
6 provides:
Every gold clause obligation is hereby
deciared to be contrary to public poiicy and
no auch provision shall hereafter be contajned
in, or made in respect of, any obligation.

I have read part of the debate in the other
House, but have not been able to go through
it ail, and as yet I do not understand why
this clause is necessary. And I certainly am
unabie to answer a question which has just
been suggested to me by an honourabie
gentleman to my right, as to how this section
ýcan be within our powers. Suppose a citizen
of any part of Canada wants to make a contract to pay a certain amount of goid at a
specified time, or to, pay a certain amount
measured in termas of our currency, at the
present parity of exchange, at a specified time.
Have we the riglit to say that such a contract
shahl be no good and against public policy?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: In the
Ulnited States the Federal Government bas
control over currency. Has our Federal Government flot similar power?
Rig-ht Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, certainly. But would the Dominion be exereising its control over currency if acting
under

this

section?

Suppose

John

Smith

wants to pay Tom Brown a certain weight
of goid, say of the value of $1,000 in our
currency at tbe present parity of gold to our
dollars. If -an agreement were arrived at
to make sucb a payment, would the Dominion
have power to declare that agreement against
public policy?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STATJNTON: That is
whbat was donc in the United States.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Domirnion can say what currency means and involves. But how can the Dominion say that
a man must not agree to pay in gold?

Hon. Mr. BLACK: As to the hypothetical
case cited, would that not be the same as
if a man agreed to pay in wbeat or potatoes?
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, just the
saine.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: A man might disregard this measure aitogether and say, "I will
give you so many pounds of gold in payment
of my contract," or "so many bushels of
wheat."
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That would
be disregarding this Bill, ahl right.
Hon. Mr. BLACK:- Under the Bihl is gold
considered a currency or a commodity?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It dues not
matter how it is considered under the Bihl1;
goid is a commodity, not a currency at ail.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: But in this Bihl is it
considered as a measure of currcncy?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. But if
John Smith wants to give Tom Brown a
certain amount of gold, a specified number
of ounces, this Bill would forbid him to do so.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I do not take it that
way.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It was running
tbrough my mind that perhaps the basis for
this section is to be found in the fact that
the Government, baving put a restriction, on
the exportation of gold, would naturaliy declare that it is against public policy to allow
obligations to be paid in gold. I will read
the fohiowing from the discussion which took
place on the second reading in the' other
House:
Hon. Mr. DuiiNN: The Bill declares that
goid clause obligations are contrary to public
policy, and provides that no future obligation
shahl contain a gohd clause. The reason for
the latter provision is obvious, that no citizen
of Canada can properly enter into an agrecinent
to pay gold when under our law he c,,nnot
now secure the gold to meet the obligation.
Mr. BENNETT: 0f course hie can get it.
Mr. DuNeNNG: Weii, practjcally hie cannot.
Mr. BENNETTr: Oh, yes; I can buy gold.
Mr. LAP01NTE (Quebec East): You cannot,
export gold without a licence.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is so,
but you can buy gold in your own country.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Or dig it out of
the ground.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think honourable members will appreciate that one must

The explanatory note reads:
Owing to abnormal economic conditions existing in some countries the current exchange rate

to ours. whsich is really depreciated.
As a matter of fact. wien the discussion
took place in Berlin. this matter affected not
only Germany, but other couîntries that had a
relatively appreciated rate of exchange, such

as Switzerland, Holiand, Italy and, I believe,
Belgium. Switzerland and Holiand particularly
broughit to our attention the fact that because
of the higher valuation of their currencies it
was difficult for them to do export business.
Mr. BENNETT: Had they gone off the gold
standard then?
Mr. EULER. They were still on the gold standard, but that difficulty was pointed out. In
fact in Switzerland the Swiss representative informed me they had actually lost in one year
$60,000,000 worth of sales to Great Britain
because of the high value of their franc.
As we have provision in the customs tariff
for adjusting the currencies of countries which.
are depreciated, perhaps it is not illogical to
give the samne power in regard to currencies
wbich are relatively appreciated. At any rate
wçe.agree to present to Parliament legisiation

further agree that, thjs baving been done, if
and wlben Germany, as doubtless she will, makes
representatinns requesting that we fix a lowerr
rate than the 40 cent rate which now obtains
on the mark, we will give it prompt consideration.
Mr. BENNETT: That is the international mark,
the gold mark?
Mr. EULER: Yes, the gold mark.
Mr. BENNETr: 'With par value of 25 cents.
Mr. EULER. Twenty-four cents, whicb in our
currency now is supposed to be worth 40 cents.
I would however point out that while we agreed
to take the power, the Government still retains
the right to use its judgment according to the
termis of the undertaking. I assure the coinmittee that the Government of Canada retains
complete control over the matter and that no
action will be taken unless Germany can prove
to our satisfaction that she has a just case.
Then finaliy, if any producers in Canada, matnfacturers or others, bave any fears with regard
ta the matter, 1 miglit point out two things.
We on this side stated during the last election
campaign-I know I stated it, the Leader of
the Government stated it-that it would net
be the intention of this Government to injure
any legitimate Canadian industry. Further, if
we find that the agreement is not working out
to our satisfaction, and if we cannot get an
adjustinent with Germany in regard to it, we
have the power within a minimum period of ten
weeks to cancel the agreement in its entirety.
In conclusion T say quite frankly that the
agreement we propose is more or less experimental. It is designed to facilitate the extension of Canadian trade in wheat and the comnmodities which we have to selI, in a market
which in past years was extremely valuable to
us. I believe that this agreement does offer a

reasonable means for expansion of Canadian

experts, and further is in accord with the belief
of this Government-and I think it is sbared
by most other countries of the civi]ized world,
although they are not carrying it into practice-

that n freer exehange of commodities between
the nations of the world would be a greater
guarantee of peace than ail the great armaments with which the nations are equipping
themselves.
I do not think I need add anything to the
honourable Minister's explanation.

considerable increase in our exports to that
country.
Hon. Mr. COPP: From, last October.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That would be
four or five months. AIl countries are striving to increase their markets. This is experimental legislation. We have statutory authority to lix the value for duty purposes of goods
from countries with a depreciated currency.
Now, we shahl try to fix the rate with respect
ta appreciated eurrency.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Why canflot the Customs officiais assess the rate of
duty on imported goods according to their
market value in this country, and disregard
the ups and éowns of foreign currency?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We have adopted
the principie of fixing the duty on the mnarket
value of the goods in the country of origin.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, this Bill in effeet provides
that the fixing of value of goods imported from
countries whose currencies are appreciated
shall be transferred from Parliament ta the
Governor in Council. It is an extension of
the field of Governor-in..Couneil government.
While I cannot forget the long series of lessons I learned on the depravity of this practice
and the perils hidden in it and endangering
hoth the Constitution and, the good faith of
Canada and the Empire, it is comforting
now to know from the mouth of the Minister
of Trade and Commerce, who has been in
Australia, New ZeaIand, Germany, and ail
other countries on this planet, that in the
present instance the practice wili not only
contribute to the expansion of the volume of
world trade, but wili actuaily have to do
with the peace of the world. It is realiy important tu know that Order-in-Council government can produce this effect. If we eau

SECOND READING
The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned de:bate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Dandurand for the second reading of Bill
80, an Act to assist in the alleviation of Unemployment and Agricultural Distress.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, when this Bill came before the House
yesterday I asked that it be delayed until this
afternoon. Since then the honourable leader
of the Government has asked me to be as
brief -as possible, as it was bis hope that
Parliarnent would prorogue to-morrow night.
I arn in entire accord with that hope, and i-f I
thought that by sitting down now I could
bring about its realization, I would sit down
at once. But I arn not at ahl certain.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

It

would be a

second worst sufferer in the Dominion of
Can-ada in regard ta unemployrnent relief. I

think Saskatchewan bas more difficulties than
we have in. Manitoba, but after Saskatchewan
aur province cornes next.
This problem started in 1929 or the winter
of 1930, and in the faîl of 1930 this Parliament made its first grant of money towards
relief. The Bennett Government first decided
that relief was the problem of the municipalities; then, when the problern becarne more
widespread,

that the provinces

should take

part; and finally, that t.he Dominion Government sha'uld make certain grants. I will not
deal with the polities of the matter, because
that does not interest me very mucb at the
moment.
I would point out that there are three
classes in -the unemployment Iist: first, there
are married people witb families; second,
there are single maIe persgons, and third, single
female persans. I arn not gaing to deal with
the cause of unemployrnent. It is sufficient
ta say that it exists and has hecorne a matter
of paramaunt importance by reason of the
way in whicb relief has been adrninistered.
Let me illustrate. In Winnipeg we had in
earlier days a number of people wha were

and saved enough out of their earnings during that pcriod to keep thema for the other

people to work for fine months and then
immcdiately go *on relief. This is particularly
marked in certain places like summer resorts,
where there is about four mnondhs' employment, and wbcre men go on relief as soon as
thc summer is over.
Before the present Government came into
power thcy led tbe people of Manitoba and
the rest of Canada to believe, through their
criticisms of what the former Government had
been doing, that if they came into power
thcy would inaugurate a new system of dealing
with this problem. In the first Speech from
the Throne under the new Administration it
was intimatcd that a commission would be
appointed to invcstigate this whole question.
Last year such a commission wus appointed.
Now, as a Manitoban I want to say that
that commission has donc notbing to relieve
unempîcyment in our province.
Truc, it
brougbht forward a proposition for home aprovement. But wbat arc the facts? Thcy
are vcry simple. A man wbo wants to improve bis home can go into a banik and
horrow money for tbat purpose if he can
satisfy the banker that bis mortgage intcrest,
taxes an(l insurance are ail paid up to datein other werds, that ho is a goyod commercial
risk. Otherwisc he cannot borrow the money.
Hon. Mr.
cndorser.

DANDURAND:

an

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Withouýt an endorser.
If be can meet the requirements the banks
would lend it anyway. AIl that the scheme
of the commission accomplishes is to make
it safer for the bankers to, lend thc moncy,
because the Govcrnmcnt takes care of fifteen
per cent of -the total loss the banks may
incur on their boans. That scheme doos not
provide emipînyment in the city of Winnipeg.
In that city there arc at the present timc
6,800 famnilies on relief, not including about
4.000 single men and about 1,500 single womcn.
Last summer tbe cost of relief in Winnipeg
was the highcst it bas ever been. Wbilc Ibere
may have been an improvement in tbc cmployment situation in Ontario or Quebcc,
there bas bcen none in the cities of tbe
Prairie Provinces.
In the city of Winnipcg we bave spent on
unemploymcnt relief since 1930 some $22.000,000. 0f ýthat sum about $8,500,000 has been
provided by the city, S7,000.000 by the Govcromrnt of Manitoba, and tbe remainder hy
the Dominion Governmcnt.
The city of
Winnipeg bis now reached sucb a position
Hlon. MIr. HAIG.

tbat it cannet carry the load any furtbcr. A
member cf the other Huse said the other
day ýtbat the people were rcciving relief from
the Bank of Montreal, and that is true, for
the city owcs the bank about $2,000,000. If
tbe bank closes down, the uncmploycd will
have to go unclothcd, unfcd and unsbeltercd,
and wben that day comes there will be a
rcvolution.
What is the solution? I have in my hand
a resolution passcd by the city council of
Winnipeg, asking that the Federal Govcrnment join witb that city in a slum-clcarance
projeet. I think I ought te, rcad the resolutien, because it substantiates part of wbat I
have said. It rcads:
Whereas a very dangerous situation bas
developed in Winnipeg due f0 overerowdling je
tbe older areas of the city, and the nprecedented shortage of smnall homes as shown je
tbe Housing Survey cf the Healfb Department
of Decemiber, 1936:
Anîl whereas the Federal Housing Act lias
not assisfed in any w-ay in alleviatiug fliese
conditions;
And whereas tlic city lias been repeateilly
assured that the Goverument would initiate a
low-cost bousing sleeme this year at flic latest.
je wlîicb belief the city did net include housing
in the list of proposed unemnpîcymeut relief
,workzs submitted te the Government on February 9, 1937;
And whereas if is quite cviilenf tliaf private
capital is unable or unwilliiig te meet the
sifuation;
Tiierefore be if r,,s,,ved fliaf fli, Couîîcil

slum -clearing purposes i)iiey at a low rate cf

Andi be if furtber resolveil that the Goveîiîment ho asked te make a substantial contributien as an unemploymnît relief measure.
If may ho said tbat the Sonate is net the
proper place te, raise this question. Primarily
it may ho a problem for the bousýe cf Commens. but the question already has been
raised je that Huse bY members from urban
parts cf the Prairie Provinces. All I want
te say is that tbe niunicipalifies cf Western
Canada cannot carry ftic load anv longer.
Calgary, Edmonton. Saskatoon, Moose Jaw,
Regina and Winnipeg are already sinking
itoder the burdün. and uubcls;s tbe Federal Geveroment undertakes the administration cf
relief, tbere is ne tclling wbat will happen.
Wbat do the finances cf the provinces of
the West show? The budget statement cf the
Manitoba Gevernment shows a total expenditurc cf about $14,500,000 and a total revenue
cf about $14.000.000. or a shertage cf about
$400.000. I sec by the estimates bore that we
are asked te vote $750.000 as a special grant
te Manitoba. That will balance the budget
cf tbe province, and beave a surplus cf $300,000
or $400.000. But Manitoba's share cf uncm-

359

APRIL 9, 1937
ployment relief is not now, and never has
been, included in the budget statement. It
is charged to capital account. It is estimated
that relief this year will cost Manitoba about
$3,400,000. So the province will go behind
about $3,000,000 on capital account, with no
assets at all to place against that amount;
and the Bank of Canada bas investigated the
situation and has said that no more taxes
can be imposed on the people of that
province.
The Dominion Government ought to realize
that this is their problem. There has been an
increase in trade and in revenues, but that
has not helped the situation in Manitoba
at all. Possibly it has assisted in Ontario
and Quebec, but in Winnipeg and elsewhere in
the West it bas been of no assistance whatever. Of the 6.800 families on relief in Winnipeg more than 1,000 have moved into the
city since 1930 in order to secure relief.
You may say, "How can this problem be
solved?" I have no solution to offer at the
moment. 'If a housing plan were undertaken
in the city of Winnipeg it would be of some
assistance, because the wage earners in 5,000
of the 6,800 unemployed families are, I should
say, artisans, and if building operations were
to resume normal proportions those men
would be put to work again. If you saddle
a municipality with one-third, or forty per
cent, of the cost of unemployment relief there
will be no capital for building enterprise.
There is an acute bouse shortage in Winnipeg,
the most acute that bas ever existed to my
knowledge. As many as five families are
living in one bouse. The rents in the municipality of St. James, for instance, are such
that the owners have notified the tenants that
they must get out, even though they do
not know where to go.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Does the municipality allow anything by way of rental?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, it makes an allowance according to the number of occupants.
About $16 a month is the maximum. The
consequence is that five or six persons are
living in two rooms-cooking, eating and
sleeping in them. I can speak with authority as to this, for a very close relative of
mine, a teacher in the city, where she went
out to see why some of the children were not
coming to sehool, found six persons living in
one room. The situation will not improve,
because one-third of the cost of unemployment relief is borne by the owners of property,
and they cannot carry the load any longer.
As long as that condition exists there will be
no private capital spent on building, and the
problem of relief and the housing shortage will
continue.

I could take you to a bouse that thirty
years ago was a fine residence in the best
residential section of Winnipeg. To-day as
many as twenty-five persons live in that bouse.
That is not good either for the people or for
the city.
Hon. Mr. HORSEY:
into an apartment?

Has it been turned

Hon. Mr. HAIG: No; it is rented outtwo rooms to a family of five or six persons.
A survey bas been made in Winnipeg. Do
honourable members realize that the civic
Department of Health spends twice as much
in one-third of that city as in the other twothirds? And that costly section is just where
the overcrowding is. The children from that
district go to school improperly fed and clothed
and live under conditions that are extremely
bad. We realize that the situation is a serions
one when we remember that these boys and
girls will be part of our adult population within
a few years. Winnipeg bas a peculiarly difficult problem, because one-third of its citizens
were born in central Europe.
I want to urge upon honourable members
that our unemployment problem will not be
cured by more trade and industry.
Hon. Mr. HORSEY:

Better crops.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, better crops would
help a little. But we need some action on a
national scale if we are to find a way out of
our present situation, with property owners
being taxed to keep people who are out of
work. I know family men, some of them with
seven or eight children, who will not take a
job. And I will be honest to express my feeling that if I were in their place I would not
take a job either. They are afraid that if they
go to work and get off relief they will not be
able to get back again. When I was studying
law I had this principle impressed upon me:
better let nine guilty men go free than hang
one innocent man. Well, what if there are
1,500 Winnipeg families receiving relief when
they should be at work? There remain more
than 5,000 families who are perhaps genuinely
in need of help because of inability to find
work. In our determination to strike unworthy persons off relief we must be careful
not to be unjust to those who are really
deserving. I plead with the Government of
this country to recognize that the problem confronting us is a national one. It will not be
solved by any commission, nor by railroads,
nor by balanced budgets. If a real attempt
is not made to solve the problem on a national
basis, there will arise strong public opinion
that will result in very definite action, and
we may be left to wonder what happened.

SENATE

Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
I have a great deal of sympathy with the unemployed, and with what bas ben said by
the honourab]e the junior senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig). Yet 1 arn convinced
that the unemployment problem, which is
growing in Canada, is to a considerable extent
due to ill-advised application of the dole and
encouragement given by the dole to people
to stay on relief rather than to take work
when it offers. The honourable senator said
that 1,000 families moved to Winnipeg within
a year. Why did they do so? Probably because they considered Winnipeg to be a place
where it was easy to get on relief. I think
that is a reasonably probable explanation, and
one that applies to large centres ail over
Canada. I know it applies to Saint John and
Halifax.
We have to continue relief to needy people,
but it should be on a downward scale. There
is more employment in Canada now than there
was a year ago or two years ago; that is, there
is more work available now than there was
at the depth of the depression. It is true
that every year there are sorne additions to
the ranks of those seeking work, as our young
people of hoth sexes corne of age; but the
available empînyment has also increased. We
recognize that in the Maritime Provinces, and
I think that, generally speaking, we have
handled the situation well there. In aimost
any part of New Brunswick, if an indigent
person can get work and refuses to take it hie
is removed from the relief list. I think that
is the proper attitude to take. because, as my
honourable friend from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Haig) pointed out, taxation is piling up and
there must be a limit to it.
I arn not so much afraid that trouble will
result from gradually scaling down relief until
it reaches the vanishing point as that the
continued granting- of relief, except where ahsolutely nece'-sary, will lead to a large inerease in the numbers of those who do not
want to work. There are many such people,
who would rather depend on others than on
thernselves; who feel that the world owes
them a living. Our forefathers who came to
this country bewed their homes out Of the
forest and made thoir living frorn the soil
or from fishing along our coasts. They did
flot get relief frorn anyone. They built up
one of the greatest countries in the world
by working hýard and by educating their
farnilies to work and to becorne good and
useful citizens. If we, as legisiators, want
Cainada to continue to develop as it bas
developed in the past. w'e shall give more
encouragcrnent to hionest labour and less to
the dole.
Ilon. Mr. HAIG.

In rnaking these rernarks I want it clcarly
understood that I arn sincerely sympathetic
withi persons who are unemployed through no
fault of their own. They must be assisted
until work is available for them, but rny
point is that we should no longer give encouragement to those people who have the
idea týhat they can get along without working, without earning their living by the
sweat of the brow.
Hon. HENRY A. MULLINS: Honourable
senators, I h'ad not intended to speak on
this matter until I listened to the remarks
of the honourable junior senator frorn Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig).
Coming from a
rural district in the province of Manitoba
as I do, I can quite understand the situation
in the city of Winnipeg. If I had my way
I would starve sorne People out of that
city and make them go on the land. Farmers
are clarnouring for help while in the cities
there are thousands of men doing nothing.
I have had rnany petitions from farmers
in rny nId constituency of Marquette who
are looking for men and asking that the
relief camps be closed.
I arn afraid there will not be much decrease in the relief lists so long as people
cao corne to the East Block here and get
money.
As it is now, rnany men wuuld
rather act as support for a larnp post in a
city than go to work on a farrn.
I appreciate the seriousness of the situation which rny honourable friend frorn Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) bas outlined. People
who have been saving throughout their lives
and have -a srnall surn set aside for their old
age are wondering how long it will last if the
present heavy taxation continues.
In the
l-,ioneering days, we who went to Winnipeg
and other parts of the West did not get aniy
relief, and I do not sec why relief should be
given now to any man who will refuse work
wlben he can get it.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senators, with leave I move the third reading
of the Bill now.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third tirne, and passed.

APRIL 9, 1937
CANADA-GERMANY PROVISIONAL
TRADE AGREEMENT BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 89, an Act respecting
a certain Provisional Trade Agreement between Canada and Germany.
He said: Honourable senators, when discussing the Customs Act amendment I alluded
to the Bill which is now before us, and I
read a statement by the Minister of Trade
and Commerce bearing on the connection between the amendments to the Customs Act
and this Bill, which contains the provisional
trade agreement that he negotiated with
Germany.
I will now read a statement
which he made when the Bill was in the committee stage in the other House.
Probably consideration of this Bill will be
facilitated if I explain quite briefly the purposes of the Bill, and give reasons why the
agreement with Germany was made and, perhaps
incidentally, correct some of the misconceptions
which apparently obtain in some quarters.
The essential feature of the Bill is that
Canada and Germany agree with each other to
accord what is generally known as the mostfavoured-nation tariff treatment. That means
that Canada gives to Germany tariff rates as
favourable as she gives to any other foreign
country. It also means that Germany gives
to Canada tariff rates as favourable as she
gives to any other country, with some slight
exceptions to which reference may be made
later. Perhaps I should also direct attention
to the fact, that when we accord to Germany
most-favoured-nation treatment, provision is
made that any preferences now given to Great
Britain or any of the Dominions are excepted
from the operation of the agreement. Germany
does not obtain those advantages.
Associated with the trade agreement proper
is what is termed a payments agreement, which
by the way does not require ratification by this
House, but the particulars of which have been
printed in the Commercial Intelligence Journal;
in fact the payments agreement was included in
the documents which were tabled in the House
last week. The vital and important factors in
the payments agreement are twofold. The first
feature is that Germany agrees and obligates
herself to provide as much exchange, cash dollar
exchange, for the purchase of Canadian goods,
as Canada buys from Germany. The second
feature of the payments agreement is that of
the exchange so described, that is, the full
amount of the sales to Canada by Germany,
she agrees to provide exchange in certain
definite proportions or percentages for the
purchase of certain commodities which we are
particularly desirous of selling to Germany,
commodities for which Germany is peculiarly a
market and which I can and perhaps shall name
later on. Those commodities comprise 63 per
cent of the total exchange which Germany shall
provide and which, as I said before, must be
equal to the full 100 per cent of all the imports
we receive from that country.
Wheat comprises 35 per cent. That is more
than half of all the designated commodities.
We thought at the time that wheat was a
commodity for which we should make sub-

361

stantial provision. Fortunately since the agreement was made and since negotiations were
carried on in Berlin the wheat situation has
been altered so materially and so favourably
that at this time it is perhaps not so important
as it was at that time, but the need may ariseagain.
The complete list is as follows:

While I am on this schedule possibly I should
explain what is meant by the final columni
in which certain maxima are presented. For
example, opposite the item of fresh apples there
is a maximum of $600,000. That means that
Germany obligates herself to provide exchange
for at least $600,000 worth of Canadian apples,
provided that the 5 per cent of her total sales
to us is as high as $600,000. For example, let
us say our total purchases from Germany are
$12,000,000. Five per cent of that $12,000,000
must be allocated to the purchase of Canadian
apples. I have taken that figure, because the
five per cent comes exactly to $600,000.
If
her sales to Canada are $12,000,000 she must
allocate exchange to the extent of $600,000 forthe purchase of apples. She is not obliged to
buy any more than $600,000 worth, because that.
maximum is fixed. However, she bas not declared any intention that in any of these cases
she will not exceed the maximum purchases
of any of the commodities named, and there is
nothing to prevent her from exceeding them.
We will suppose the Canadian imports of German goods amount to more than $12,000,000.
Then the five per cent which is specified would
be more than the $600,000. She is not obliged
to provide exchange for more than $600,000,
worth, but the excess which would be indicated
by the increased imports must then be allocated
to the purchase of other commodities.
Sixty-three per cent is allocated to these particular commodities. I believe there is a list
of about twenty-one of then. The list was
selected on this basis: Canada is particularly
desirous of selling to Germany those goods for
which Germany is peculiarly a market. I might
name some of them. For example, there are mild
cured salmon, eels, pegwood, dried apples, fishmeal, and commodities of that sort. Then, we
were particula.rly desirous of having Germany

SENATE

362

buy some of our products which they were not
particularly anxious to buy. It is generally
known that Germany desires to obtain raw
materials, of which she says she is in desperate
need. That was one of the points with which
we had to contend, and one of the reasons why
we insisted that she obligate herself to an appropriate exciange not only for the things she wants
to buy, such as metals and minerals. but for
the things which we are anxious to sell, including wheat and other commodities.
Perhaps that is enough for me to read from
If honourable

members desire to familiarize themselves further with the situation, they may refer to the
debate of yesterday on this Bill in the other
House.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. Article
Il is in these terms:
The provisions of article I shall not extend to:
(a) special privileges which either of the
contracting parties grants or may hereafter
grant to neighbouring countries for the facilitation of frontier traffic within a zone not extending as a rule beyond fifteen kilometres on either
side of the frontier;
(b) privileges which either of the contracting parties may hereafter accord to a state by
virtue of a customs union with that state.

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, as everyone knows, this is
not a phase of legislation with respect to which
we' should think of interposing our will in any
way. It is a treaty of trade and commerce,
It
but of a purely provisional character.
specifies nothing in detail. The treaty gives
certain very general and very vague rights
mutually. An amusing feature is article VI.
The contracting parties agree that it is their
intention to replace the present provisional
agreement as soon as possible with a general
convention of commerce and navigation.

On the whole, if this is the mouse that has
come out of the mountain, I am afraid that
as respects Mr. Euler's trip the profits on the
trade which he has provided for by this treaty
will not amount to the expenses of travel.

It would not be very difficult to violate that
article. I do not know what purpose it serves.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:

It is a gesture.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. Another
article gives one an insight into the vagueness
of the whole treaty. Honourable members
may get some amusement out of article IV. It
reads:
In thte event of either of the contracting
parties prohibiting or restricting the importation or exportation of goods, that party undertakes to give due consideration to the interests
of the other party.
We should
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
have an interpretation clause on the word
"due."
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And another
clause on "due consideration." Then article
III:
h'lie Government of Canada shall give due
consideration to German interests with regard
to the importation of articles produced or
manuifactured in Germany.
The German Govertment shall give due
consideration to Canadian interests witi regard
to the importation of articles produced or
manufactured in Canada.

I suppose "due consideration" has been duly
defined in the courts of both contracting parties
as meaning absolutely nothing.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Governments,
you know, promise "due consideration."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

That is to say, if there is anything in this
treaty to get out of-I have not found it yetall that either contracting party has to do is
make a treaty with another state in the form
of a customs union.

CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
CAPITAL REVISION BILL
MESSAGE FROM HOUSE OF COMMONS

Honourable
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
members, a message has been received from
the House of Commons in the following words:
That a message be sent to the Senate to
acquaint their Honours that this House hath
agreed to their amendments to Bill No. 12,
"An Act to provide for revision of the accounting set-up of the Canadian National Railway System," with an amendment to their
second amendment as follows: by striking out
of the said amendment the words "representing

an aggregate indebtedness of $1,334,567,414 is
disclosed in the net debt of Canada and" and
substituting therefor the words "is included
in the net debt of Canada, and disclosed";
for the following reasons:
The inclusion of the second amendment as
worded nullifies the purpose of this Bill in
that it restores to the balance sheet the amount
of accumulated operating deficits covered by
loans, and adds thereto the amounts voted
in the form of contribution (which are not
and never have been loans) under the Maritime Freight Rates Act. 1927, and The Canadian National-Canadian Pacifie Act, 1933, which
amounts are duplicated in the net debt of
Canada.

When shall this message be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Now.

APRIL 9, 1937
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: 1 do
not think it shouid be taken into consideration.
I do flot like having addressed to us such utter
nonsense as is in that message. 1 shouid nlot
mind the Commons' rejection of our amendment if they wouid give us a reason that is
true. To tell us that that restores to the
balance sheet a certain sum which is being
written off is an affront. We know it does
not, and they know it does not.
1 feel disposed to, meet the leader of the
Government in this matter, aithough I have
stili not the slightest doubt as te the merits of
our stand. In fact we yieided, yieided, yieided
right along. Bec-ause we insist on the people
knowing t.he facts, so as to try to hring their
psychology to -a realization that we cannot continue going into debt for ever, we are accused
of heing enprnîps of the Canadian National
Railways. I have heard this accusation for
many years. I suffered from. it ail the time
I was leader of the Conservative party. Alth-ough, at a cost of no fewer than fifty seats
in this Dominion, 1 was the main acter ini
the drama that brought about ownership of
the National Railways by the country, men
who then pointed their finger at me as the
rascai author of the programme now hoid me
up as the enemy of the National System.
I do not know how anything could be more
preposterous--I had almost said more c-ruel.
The stery commenced in 1921. One man
was the principal in the whole programme of
disseminating th-at story through the Dominion. He is the same man who was mainly
responsible for the $100,000,000 of added
deht through nine years of revel. He was
the head of the forces marching through ai]
that débâcle.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is he a member
of Parliament?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No, he is
not a member of Parliament. To he very
frank, I refer to, Sir Henry Thoruton. He
was the man who disseminated that story and
thus was responsibie for the aligument of
that entire railway vote almost f0 a man.
Now we hear the charge agaîn. If you seek,
even hy a footnote, f0 let the people know
that this road financially is not heing made
a success, týhat it is going into debt at a
ghastiy rate-if you do not, indeed, enter into
a conspiracy with others to conceal it from
the people, you are the enemy of the Canadian National Railways. That is the polifical side of this matter. It appeared even
in this House, where if certainiy had. no right
to appear. How anyone can stand up and
represent nie as the en*emy of the National
Raiiway System I do not know. If anyone
in Canada should have profited in reputa-

363

tion by the success of the system, I do not
think it wouid be any other than myself; at
ieast, no one certainly shouid have profited
more. Such has n-ever been my lot. 0f thaf
I arn not eomplaining. But I am complaining of being pointed ouf one hour as the
author of the wickedness and the next hour
as the enemy of whaf I created, and particularly of being represenfed as the enemy
berause I feel it is better for the Dominion that, even when we are doing righf
in respect of our accounting, we do not endeavour to mislead the people fo their own
wrong.
With those, remarks I arn going to accede
to the position of the Government. So far
as the honourable leader is concerned, we

Hon. RAOUL DANDUTRAND:

I mýust ex-

press my appreciation of the stand that my

right honourable friend takes on this Bill as if
is new before us. I fhink the main difference
between us has nofhîng to do with the Bill.
What is in bis mind, as in the minds of us ail,
is the question: What can we aildo, coliec'tively
or individuaily, fowards irnpreving the financial
situation cf our railway system? Unfortunateiy we have not, legislativeiy, made very
great advance fowards irnproving the situation.
I said yesterday, or the day hefore, that we
had heen met by two policies to which we had
to bow: the one which carried the day in
1930, and the one which carried the day in
1935. What will to-morrow hring? My honourable friend from Monfarvilie (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien) has suggested that the people will
speak. Weli, in the solution cf a problem
of such importance and intrîcacy as this, the
oniy men upon whom we can reiy are the
ones who have been and stili are striving te
bring about a remedy; and they are te be
found in the two branches cf Parliament. I
have yet te hear of any constructive policy
froma outside which has heen reflected in the
attitude cf the Heuse cf Commons or the
Senate cf Canada. It dees net maffer whaf
kind cf balance sheet we present, for ninetenths cf the people cf Canada do not understand a balance sheet. Se in reality the responsibility is upon us.

SENATE

It is to be hoped that as prosperity increases
in the country, as the West comes back to its
old-time form and furnishes more freight for
the railways, the situation will improve. Of
course there are very many handicaps. Competition is appearing in various new forms. I
have no suggestion to make as to what we
should do to improve the position of the
railroads. It is for the experts of those two
great systems to try to come together to find
a solution; then it will be for the men at the
helm to accept the responsibility of presenting
it to Parliament.
I confess that I am not a railway man and
that I have not yet found the true radical
solution. I have not much altered my views
since 1925 as to what the ideal solution would
be. At that time we heard railway men and
great financiers who were summoned before
our committee. My right honourable friend
himself was at the helm, or at all events was
playing an important role in the other House
at that time, but that House did not accept
with much optimism the suggestion embodied
in the unanimous resolution of the Senate.
How that suggestion would fit in, if resurrected and examined to-day, I do not know.
The people of Canada apparently want the
Canadian National Railways to be maintained
as a separate entity. That seems quite clear.
Will they change their mind? If se, to what
extent will they change it, and to what extent
would the country benefit? This is such a
difficult problem that I hesitate to express
any judgment upon it at this hour.
I cannot close without thanking my right
honourable friend for accepting the compromise suggestion placed before this Chamber
yesterday by my right honourable friend from
Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham). That
amendment, I think, will satisfy those who
desire to link up the balance sheet of the
Canadian National Railways with the public
accounts of Canada, wherein appears a statement of what the country has donc not only
for the Canadian National, but for the Canadian Pacifie and the other railways that have
received subsidies from the Dominion. We
all know that the amount represented is a
formidable one. It may be a lesson to other
young countries like our own, and may be
an inducement to them to consider carefully
any similar situation which presents itself to
them. We know that the railways of our
sister dominions have not always enjoyed the
greatest prosperity. All countries have had to
bear a burden of the same kind. Exven France,
a country with 40,000,000 people within a
small area and with railways running east and
west, north and south, is facing formidable
deficits every year. I cannot speak by the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

book for other countries, but J do know of
that one. Let us hope that brighter days are
ahead, for Canada and that we shall be relieved
of the load we now have to bear.
I move, seconded by the Right Hon. Mr.
Graham, that the Senate concur in the report
of the House of Commons on this Bill.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Before the
motion is put, honourable senators, I should
like to say a word. While 1, of course, will
follow my leader in the decision he has arrived at, I certainly regret it, because I think
it will create a false impression among the
taxpayers and the people of Canada generally.
One can visualize two years frorn now, or
probably at an earlier date, enthusiastic Government supporters appearing on election platforms throughout this country with two balance sheets in their hands. They will get up
and say, "When we came into power this was
the condition of the Canadian National Railways, owing to the bad government of the
Conservative party."
I protest most
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
vehemently that men in their senses would not
rise to say such a thing on the basis of these
facts.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I protest vehemently, because there will appear annually a
statement of the operations of the railway,
and the best evidence of any advance having
been made will be an improvement in the
receipts and expenditures.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Very well, I
will put it in another way, which I hope will
be more pleasing to my honourable friend.
Those who will sec the balance sheet will
gain an erroneous impression. Very few, if
any, will go to the public accounts to see
what the real liabilities of the road are. The
only object of those on this side of the House,
as the honourable senator from Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) said so eloquently yesterday, is to keep before the people of Canada
the amount that is written off. I think that is
the only fair and right thing to do.
Now I leave the balance sheet for the
moment. The honourable leader of the House
says that he-and I suppose he speaks for
the Government-has no solution whatever
for the railway problem of Canada.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
economie policy.

Except

the

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Quite so. My
honourable friend and I live in the same city:
the sarne people who speak to me speak also
to him. On many occasions they say, "How

APRIL 9, 1937
long are we going to be able to stand this
terrible financial drag?" No doubt the answer
which my honourable friend gives to these
people is the answer that 1 have given many
times: "It is impossible, or at least very difficuit, for a party government to do anything."
Then these people immediately say, "WeIl,
when are we going to have a national government that will really grapple with this
question?"
There are oniy two solutions: unified management, or amalgamation. I was in hopes
that something would be done, because in
listening to the radiatorRigbt Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Hot air!
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hlon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: You will pardon
the slip. When I was listening to the Prime
Minister over tbe radio during the iast election
he said: "There bas been a good deal of talk
in this country about creating a national government. If you give me the majority I arn
looking for, I am satisfied that with Liberal
governments in alI the provinces we shall have
to ail intents and purposes a national government." The Prime Minister and bis Goverament received a majority very much larger, 1
think, than even he in bis optimismi expected.
So, according to bis word, we have a national
government, and I hope that at some near
date in the future, instead of giving us what
is merely a change in the figures on the balance
sheet, it will grapple with this question. This
is not a question for the heads of the two
raiiways. It is a national question. It is up
to the Government to deal with it. It la up
to the Government to send for the heads of
those two railroads and to say to them, "We
cannot carry on with this tremendous debt."
And if the true financial position of Canada
and of our railroads were placed before the
people of Canada, they would, I amn sure, give
their best efforts to assisting this Government
or any other government to solve the problem,
which, as I have said, cati be solved only in one
of two ways--either by amalgamation or by
unified management.
Hon. A. C. HARDY: May I be permitted a
very few words to introduce an entireiy different tone into this discussion? I want to
express the appreriation of the mem.bers of
this House-and I know I speak for honourable members on both sides-of the great
patience and forbearance which both our
leaders have exercised in this very troubled
and difficuit matter. I do not tbink the
high plane of debate reached witbin the last
few days bas been exceeded on any other
question. For myself, and, I am sure, for al
honourable *members of this Chamber, I ex-

365

press deep gratitude for the fairness and forbearance, to say natbing of the great ability,
which the bonourable leaders on both sides of
the House bave brought to bear on this whole
question.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators, may I express rny regret at the abandonment by the right honourable leader on this
aide (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) of the amendment which I moved? I understand bis decision and I accept it. If government is to be
carried out in an efficient way in this country,
both Houses of Parliament must give and take,
must work together. Therefore I fully concur
in the decision which my right honouýrable
leader bas made.
I should also like to point out that the value
of my amendment bas been strongly endorsed
by remarks just made by the honourable leader
of the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand). He
said that virtually no one would understand
the balance sheet. Well, honourabie senators, if 'that is so, would ýmy suggested foottiote
not have been f ar more useful than it would
have 'been if that balance sheet were fully
understood by everybody? The foottiote was
simple and clear. It drew attention to the
facit that $1,334,000,000 had been furnished by
this country to the Canadian National and had
gone by the board. That would have been an
im-pressive reiminder to our people of the tremendous sacrifice that Canada has made for
titis railroad.
My honourable friend said also that the
people should not be called upon to suggest a
solution to the railway problem.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
unable to do so.

That they are

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: That is quite true.
But the saine la fs-ne with respect to every
great proiblem i-4hieh faces the country. For
instance, is the Government ta wait for a solution to unemployment to be suggested by the
people, or must it busy itself to find a solution? What is necessary in the present case,
as my honourable f'riend is no doubt aware, is
that the people sho>uld insist upon having the
railway problem settled by the Government.
T-hat is essenti-al, if mny honouraible friend will
allow me to say so, in order that the Govertiment may fulfil its duty to the country, for
unless there is strong public opinion demanding
that something be done, the Government will
not take the requisite action. I take it that
we need to circulate propaganda tbroughout
the country with a viýew to getting behind the
Government sufficient public opinion to cause
tbe lifting of the railway burden from the
shoulders of the nation.

the country has got rid of $1,334,000,000 of

MURDOCK:

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I am not expecting that the people will present to the Government a fully prepared solution to our
railway problem, but I do submit that we
in this Parliament should do our duty of
keeping before the minds of the people the
fact that unless our railway problem is solved
we shall be faced with bankruptcy. If we
do that, the people will in time resolve that
the problen must be settled. Then the Government will be told plainly to (lo its duty or
suffer the consequences.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, I want my first word to be that
so far as I personally am concerned no thought
of mine, nor, so far as I know, any statement of mine, was ever to the effect that
the right honourable leader on the other side
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) has been against
the Canadian National Railway System. In
fact. my view has always been otherwise.
What is involved in this Bill? In my humble judgment, from the little and unimportant
experience that I have had in railroad matters, all that is involved is the giving to the
Canadian National, as a publicly operated
railroad system, a fair deal and a chance to
show reasonable operating results, through no
longer requiring it to be handicapped by an
inequitable balance sheet. Every honourable
senator knows that millions upon millions of
dollars which have been included in the Canadian National's balance sheet of the past have
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

been, in part, an heirloom handed down from
pre-Confederation days: $15,000,000 in 1848,
1854 and 1855, and tens of millions of dollars
granted in subsidies or assistance to railways
before the Canadian National Railway System was ever dreamed of.
My honourable friend from Alma (Hon.
Mr. Ballantyne) intimated a little while ago,
as I understood him, that he anticipated that
during the next general election distinguished
gentlemen would be on the platform with two
balance sheets-one the balance sheet we have
now authorized the Canadian National Railways to make effective, the other an extract
from the Auditor General's report showing
this $1,334,000,000 that has heretofore been
hanging-I think, unfairly-as a millstone
around the neck of the Canadian National
Railways. I think my honourable friend from
&lma is absolutely correct. There will be
gentlemen who will do just that, but they
will be gentlemen who will in my judgment
be trying to blackmail the Canadian National
Railways, as there have been gentlemen at
work blackmailing and discrediting the system
for many years past. Those are the gentlemen who will be up there with two balance
sheets. If we are reasonably inclined to give
a square deal to the Canadian National Railways, is it unfair to assume that possibly with
a reasonable business recovery-and we have
already had some of it-there will be a better
showing in the final results of the operation
of the Canadian National Railways, and that
we shall be placing the system on an even
basis with other railways in this countryyes, and in other countries?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Does my honourable friend not think that a year from
now the Canadian National Railways' balance sheet will look much more favourable
than the last one?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Indeed I do.
Furthermore, I believe the balance sheet for
many years should have looked much more
favourable, because it would have shown a
reasonable operating profit.
If the actual
operating results had been included, it would
have show n a muchRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It could not
affect the operating results.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: -brighter
than it has shown heretofore.

picture

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It could not
possibly show the slightest difference in
operating results, because the new set-up
obliges the Canadian National Railway System to pay interest on its bonds outstanding
to the public, and the old one did the same.

APRIL 9, 1937
The- net resuits are just operating resuits
less interest owing to the public. It is
those which have run $50,000,000 short in the
past, and if we had had this balance sheet
for the iast ten years the resuits wouid have
shown exactly the samie.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: It wouid have been
gene.raliy better as an operating picture, I
think. Others may hold their own opinion.
I want to make a brief reference to the
proposai made twice by the honourabie senator from Aima. He gave two exampies of how
this railway situation couid be improved,
as I understood him. He indicated there
was oniy one or other of two plans to make
the picture better and better for the Canadian taxpayer. I arn wondering-and I arn
seifish in this-whether the honourable senator took into consideration what the application of bis beneficent proposai wouid mean
to the operating of our raiiroads, or wouid
mean-I do not think I exaggerate-to tens of
thousands of Canadian railway men and
their farnilies. I wonder if he took into consideration what bis proposais would mean
to thousands of settlers in o.utiying parts of
Canada who iocated on various brancb uines,
and who wouid probabiy be, under a unified
one-systern control. without any train service. I do flot believe that those who have
heen arguing so strenuousiy to put the Canadian National Railways out of business under
any circumstances have taken into consideration some of those factors. I thought my
honourahie friend from Aima should, have
stated what under bis proposai wouid be done
by presumabiy two-thirds of the present
operating staff of the Canadian National Railways, who are citizens of Canada and are
surely entitled to some consideration.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

IMMIGRATION BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 102, an Act to amend the

Immigration Act.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:

This Bill

does not contain anything that enlarges in
any way the matter of immigration into CanHon. Mr. DANDURAND.

The amendments are all of a character

which will be conducive to the more efficient
functioning of the Act. More than two-thirds
of the amendments provided by this Bill relate to changes necessitated by the reorganization of the department into the Department
of Mines and Resources. As honourable members are aware, there formerly was a Department of Immigration with its own officers,
such as the Deputy Minister and the Assistant Deputy Minister. Under the reorganization their offices disappeared. Under the
Immigration Act specific duties were imposed
upon the officers I have mentioned, and it is
necessary ta have certain sections of the Act
amended in order to bring them into line with
the reorganization.
There are some other amendments, which
can be very easily explained. One relates to
the matter of domicile. A Canadian who is
absent from Canada for more than six years
loses the right of domicile in Canada. That
is a hardship, particularly as it applies to
missionaries in foreign lands and agents of
commercial companies in offices outside Canada.
There are further changes relating to the
more rigid examination of immigrants entering Canada from Great Britain or European
countries in respect of an ailment known as
trachoma.
There is a further provision for the refunding of deposits made by steamship companies
when one of a steamship crew deserts at a
port such as Vancouver or Montreal. There
is no provision in the law at the present time
for the return of the $300 deposit exacted
from those companies. In many instances a
deserter may drop off one ship and join
another in a couple of weeks, but there is
no power to return the money that we compel
the steamship company to deposit with the
department.
I went through the entire Bill, and did not
even have to read the explanatory notes.
Each clause clearly expresses what it means.
With this explanation, honourable senators, I move, by leave of the House, that
the Bill be read a second time.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: This
Bill is of considerable length. The main purpose, apparently, is to make such amendments
to the Immigration Act as are necessitated
by the amalgamation of the old Department
of Immigration with the Department of Mines
and Resources. The explanatory notes say
this is the whole purpose of the Bill. but
it is not. If honourable members will look
at subsection 3 of the new section 43 they
will see that is entirely new, as is subsection
9 of section 53. In these two respects the ex-

APRIL 10, 1937
planatory notes are misleading. However, I
do nlot sce anything of seriaus importance or
anything ta complain about in either of these
additions. I arn prepared ta accept second

the changes to which I referred were the
main ones.

Rîght Hon. ARTHUJR MEIGREN: Hanourable members, the address which the Senate
is now asked ta adopt is timely and fitting
an the occasian of the Caronation of a monarch of this Empire. In my humble judgment it contains all that need ha said, and
its language is at ance dignified and impressive. The citizens af Canada have certainly
nlot failed ta observe the sense of responsibility and desire for service and the true
conception of majesty which aur new King
bas evidenced since the hour ha assumed
the duties af the Thrane. A continuation
of that attitude and that demonstratian of

Hon. Mr. DUFE: I would suggest, honourable senators, that we now rise and sing the
first verse of the National Anthem.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Honourable members then rose and sang

NAVAL AFFAIRS
ORDER

DISOHARGED

On the Order:
Resuming the further adjourned debate on
the question proposed by the Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne:
That he will eall the attention of the Senate
to the training of naval cadets and the closing
of the Naval College and aise to the sale of the
training ship Aurora.-Hon. Mr. Black.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Honourable members, 1
think 'this Order may as well be discharged. It
will, 1 arn sure, improve in the keeping, and its
discussion will be more pertinent and informative at the next session. I say that because
we are rushing te a close of the session. The
Banking and Commerce Committee is te sit
after we rise, and the time now at our disposai
is so short that it would net be worth
while for us to attempt to conclude the debate.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I had suggested
that perhaps we could take up the Order this
afternoon, because I fei-t I owed it to the
honourable senator froma Aima (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) and those voho followcd himi in the
debate to express my views and perhaps, in
part, those of the Government on this matter.
The atmosphere in Europe is clearing somewhat, and 1 hope this country will remain safe
during -the next few months. I shaîl be in a
better position later to state exactly the views
whieh I intended presenting to, this House.
The debate will be adjourned till Monday.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Dropped!
At 1 o'clock the Senate took recess.
The Senate resumed at 4 p.m.

report of
and Comiand conAct and

He said: Honourable senators, the committce
have considered this Bill and report it with
many amendments. I will not read the report.
Iýt consista of about eight pages, I think.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it you'r ple asure, honourable members, to concur in the
amendments to this Bill?
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, the Bill was sent to the Banking
and Commerce Committee, where it met with
considerahie criticism from various angles.
It soon hecame apparent that unless we sat
for a couple of weeks examining and testing
every principle contained in the Bill, as well
as in the Act of 1935, upon which it is based,
we should be unable to, reach a conclusion
satisfactory to the members of the committee.
This being so, I suggested that the Act of
1935 should be amended as little as possible
and that we should direct our attention
exclusively to, two features of the Bill as it
came to us from the House of Commons. The
first feature had to do with the transfer of
the administration of this Act from the
President of the Privy Council and the Tariff
Board, se, called, to, the Department of Labour
and n commissioner to be appointed. There
The
were also consequential amendments.
second feature was the amendment of the
clause which referred to the admissibility, at
any criminal trial which might follow an
inquiry, of evidence, flot documentary but
oral, that had been hrought before the
commissioner. I thought that by thus limiting the purport cf the Bill we could reach a
conclusion which would be more satisfactory,
not only te the Minister who bas heen in
charge of the Bill, but te this Chamber as
well.
But when we came te the question of transferring administration of the Act te the
Department of Labour it was proposed that
the commissioner's powers should be limited
te the conducting cf a preliminary inquiry,
and not include the right te hear witnesses
tinder oaxth or compel production cf dcuments. Realizing that the committee desired
te transfer from himself to a person in judicial
office the power te, decide, after a preliminary
inquiry, whether there was sufficient evidence
te .iustify full investigation, the Minister
suggested-although he feared this would
deprive him cf his responsibility as Minister
of Labour in such cases-that the authority
te make the decision be vested in the
Attorney-Ceneral cf Canada or the Minister
cf Justice. This wvas net acceptable te the
majerity cf the committee, sud there xvas
proposed an amendment which ivas carried
and has been cmbodied in the report before

APRIL 10, 1937

us, and which provides that if the comvmissioner dasires, after a preliminary inquiry, to
proceed with further investigation ha must
appiy for authority so ta do from the
President of the Exchequer Court or the
Chairman of the Dominion Trade and Industry Commission, if ha ha a lawyar of tan
yaars' standing. The committea also made
an amendment providing that only the oral
evidenca which. is given on inquiry may be
used in any subsaquant trial arising out of
an inquiry.
I thougbt that possihly tha Ministar would
ha disposed to accept tha Bill as amanded
by the Ba.nking and Commerce Committea,
but after axamining into the amendments
prapared in consaquanca of the committee's
decision-amendments whicb had not bean
drafted wben the committee voted on the
principla-he has coma to, the conclusion that
ha cannot accapt the Bill witb these amandments. Ha feals that tha Bill in the form in
whicb we now have it haf ara us violatas an
essantial principla in the administration of
the Act, and that ha would ha accapting tha
shadow while the substance would not ha
thara. Consequently ha bas authorizad me
to declare that ha will not support the Bill
in its prasent shape if it passas this Chambar
and is sent to, the Housa of Commons; that
ha would rathar examine into the situation
batwaen now and naxt session and sea, after
consulting witb bis colleagues in Parliament,
what kind of measura ha could introduca next
yaar. Therefora I am precluded from. moving
concurrence in the amendmants.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourahie senators, the statemant iust made by
the honourabla leader of tha Government
comas as a very great surprise to honourable
mambars of this Housa. I say that because,
as every bonourable mamnbar of the committee
knows, the resolution which was movad in
committea authorizing amendmants along a
certain lina was accepted by the Minister
thera. Tha leader of the Government statad
that the Ministar acceptad the amendments
ta ha made along that lina.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The vote ws
taken when ha was at the meeting of the
committea tbis morning, and ha did not agree
to the amendmant which was carried. Wa
diracted our Law Clark and the representative
of the Depsrtment of Justice to prepara
amendments hasad on the principle which had
been voted upon hy the committea. Tha
Minister had no opportunity of seeing wbst
the form of those amendments would bel
and the only intimation I had from him ws
that parhaps ha could accept thatn and sea if
tbey worked satisfactorily when appliad under
31117-24J

the Act. But after examining into the amend-ments and the situation, he bas decided that.
the transfer of ministerial responsihility forthe administration of th-is Act to a judicial
authority would be a dangerous principle ta
which to agree.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I was simply
stating what occurred. The motion authorizing
amendments to be made to a certain definite
effect was carried, and the leader of the Government raported to the committee that the
Minister had accepted that situation and was
prepared to accept such amendments as gave
affect to that motion. The smendments a8
submitted were accepted by the committee
as a whola and hy the leader of the Government as carrying this out in the fullest detail,
and the committea unanimously reported the
Bill thus amended.
Now, I know it is not the wish of the
leader of the Governmant in this House (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) that the stand which he bas
outlinad be taken. I want te record this
statament now, that the Minister bas not
treated the committae rightly. Having authorized the leader of the Government ta say
to the committe-e that amendmants carrying
out that motion would be accepted, the
Ministar bas no righýt, after the committea
reports, to send word to the Senate that he
will not accept them. It is an unfair action,
an action not worthy of a Minister.
I have no further step to take.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators-Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would my honourable friend shlow me?
My right honourable friand (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) well knows what the attitude of
the Ministar was during the discussion in committee lsst avening and this morning. After
hearing the discussion of last evening the Minister came back this morning with smendments which he thougbt would go far towsrds
satisfying a majority of the committee; amendments in accordance with the view that he
understood to have been exprassed. He was
ready to agree to submaission to the Dapartment of Justice of evidance adduced at a preliminary inquiry. The committee would not
accept this suggestion and decided the evidence should ha rafarrad to a court. And
he, having to considerRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Will the
leader of the Governmant not admit that ha
stated to the committae that the Minister
had agreed to accept amendmants in tarms
of the motion which I moved and which was
carried?

372

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The remarks
that I made will be found in the report of
the committee's proceedings. I think my
memory is not at fault when I say that the
Minister heard the statement of the right
honourable gentleman embodying a principle
to be drafted into an amendment. I saw the
Minister before I returned to the committee
this afternoon and he was inclined at that
moment to accept the will of the committee
as inevitable, but with considerable reluetanceRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But he did
accept it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -in the hope
that operation of the Act could be carried on
fairly. Now, I have no objection to the Bill
being sent over to the House of Commons.
But I feel that in loyalty to this Chamber
it is my duty to say I have just been informed, after the Minister had examined
into the effect of the amendments with some
of his colleagues of the Government, which
had not met since the committee rose at
one o'clock, the Government would not feel
like accepting the Bill if sent in its present
form to the House of Commons. I am bound
to inform the Senate to that effect, so that
the whole situation may be made clear at
this time. I have stated with all sincerity
everything that bas taken place, and now the
Senate is free to take whatever action it
pleases.
If some honourable members, as a result
of my statement that the Minister would
reluctantly accept 'the Bill as it came from
the Senate, have been precluded from moving further amendments, I desire to say they
are now free to propose such further amendments as they may desire.
I have not perhaps emphasized sufficiently
the statement which the Minister made to
me before I entered this Chamber a moment
ago, 'that instead of accepting this legislation
which is now before us he much preferred to
leave the Act of 1935 as it is and prepare
himself to study the whole situation so as
next session to present a Bill which would
perhaps cover more ground than does this
measure. The Bill as it stands at this stage
is so unsatisfactory to him that he would
rather defer further action for the present
and next session present a Bill which, he
hopes, will commend itself to the two Chambers.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What the
honourable leader of the Government said
in committee will no doubt be on record, for
the statements were taken down. The honourable leader opposite bas not denied-and I
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

know will not deny, for he is a man of
honour-that he reported the Minister had
accepted the amendments, though reluctantly.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I have just indicated.

Under the terms

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, under
the terms he had accepted the amendments.
On the faith of that the committee acted and
reported. I make only one statement: the
Minister has not kept faith with the committee.
Each honourable member may take what
action he feels right from his own standpoint; but, so far as I am concerned, there
will be no motion made in respect of these
amendments accepted by the leader of the
Government, or in respect of the Bill in
any phase at all.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, I do not feel I should be doing my
duty as a member of this House if I did not
now say something in connection with the
Combines Investigation Act. As a layman
I have for many years been more or less
interested in the Act, and I think I should
know something of its operation in years gone
by.
In the past few days I have had an opportunity of sitting in and hearing the Banking
and Commerce Committee discuss this Bill.
To me it is an astounding fact that no layman-and please understand I am not holding the chairman responsible for this-no layman could get an opportunity reasonably and
consistently to present his views. While I
am sure the chairman and all others would
say I could have had an opportunity to
present my views, I realize it would have
been worse than useless to do se.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question? I saw him sitting in the committee a great deal of the
time. Can he give a single instance in which
a layman indicated a desire to speak and
was net given an opportunity to do so?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I saw my honourable friend from Kootenay East (Hon. Mr.
King) on two or three occasions struggling
for the floor and being interrupted by lawyers.
The chairman did give him an opportunity
to speak.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Every time he rose
he did not get an opportunity to speak
immediately, because other members at my
end of the room were on their feet hefore
him. As long as I have been chairman of
that committee I have tried to give every
man an opportunity to speak in turn.

APRIL 10, 1937
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I arn sure of that;
but the fact remains that the discussion was
largely taken up by lawyers pre.senting their
various views. There was continued insistence on the part of legal gentlemen. One or
more expressed surprise, if flot horror, at
the possibility of someone with political bias
being entrusted with the administration of
this Bill, and, just before the committee
adjourned, my good friend from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Côté) suggested: "Do not hold publie
hearings." Those are the words I took down,
and I arn sure the record will sustain my
position.
Hon. Mr. COTE: May I ask the privilege
of giving my own words? I said that a preliminary
inquiry-not
an
investigationshould not be held in public.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Let my honourable
friend look at the record and see what he
said.
Hon. Mr. COTE: The record will confirm
what I say now.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Some honourable
senators opposite have expressed great horror
at the possibility of the Commissioner, under
direction of the Minister, going into an
office of a company alleged to be a combine,
examining books and papers and taking documente for his information. I understood several honourable gentlemen to hold up their
bands in horror at the audacity of any proposai to do anything of that kind. I came to
the conclusion, and I amn firmly convinced,
that certain honourable gentlemen 'have been
arguing for one law for the big and wealthy
Iaw-breaker and another law for the poor fellow who, steals a loaf of bread. The poor thief
would be taken into court and a public hearing would 'be held. But as for the malefactor
in high place who is trying to exact tribute
in the forrn of t.housands, perhaps millions,
of dollars from consumers, producers or oChers,
they assert hie must not have a public hearing.
It would reflect upon hiÀs integrity as a citizen,
and you must not suggcst anything that would
be detrimental to him.
Let us see what authority you honourable
senators in your wisdom have this session
given to officiaIs in various departments to do
certain things in upholding the la>w. You
passed a few days ago Bill 65, an Act respecting the Testing, Inspection and Sale of
Seeds. Let us sce wh'at autho-rity is given the
inspector under that Bill-authority that you
are not willing to give to somebody who,
niaybe, is after some distinguished gentlemen

373

for having conspired with one another to get
unfair profits from the public. Section 16 ai
the Bill is in these words:
Any inspector charged with the enforcement
of this Act may require a grower or dealer to
take a statutory declaration in respect to seed
presented ta an inspector for grading and
sealing in containers as may be prescribed by
regulation, and may enter upon any premises
to make any examinat ion of any plants or seeds,
in containers or in bulk, whether such seeds or
plants are on the premises of the owner or on
other prernises, or in the possession of any
carrier, and may take officiai samples therefrom
for which samples the owner shahl, on dcmand,
be paid in accordance with the amount thus
taken and its current value; further, hie may
inake or have made any examination of books,
invoices or other records to determine the
truthfulness cf advertising or public etatements
in respect to seed offered for sale.
A few days ago you passed also Bill 64, an
Act te Control and Regulate the Sale of
Feeding Stuifs. Let me give two sections of
the Bill:
9. There may be appointed in the manner
authorized by law sucli inspecters and analysta
as the Minister may consider necessary for the
effective carrying out of the provisions of
this Act.
10. An inspecter may at aIl reasonable times
enter any premises in which he bas reasonable
cause to believe any feeding stuif is being or
has been prepared for sale and may take for
analysis samples of any f eeding stufi there
found on payment of the vaiue of such samples.
Then, a few d-ays ago, you passed another
Bill, 119, an Act te amend The Excise Act,
1934, in which you gave authority te certain
officers cf the Government who, might be actuated by pelitical bias, accerding te the view
of honourable gentlemen who were so insistent
on such a possibility befere the Banking and
Commerce Committee. You stated in section
96 of that Bill:

Every one whe, when called upon in the King's
name by an officer of excise, te aid or assist

him in the execntion of any act or duty required
by this Act, refuses or negleets se te do, and
every master or persen in charge of any vessel
aud every driver or persan conducting or having
charge of any vehicle or cenvcyance, whe refuses
or neglects to stop snch vessel, vehicle or cenveyance when required te do se in the King's
name by an efficer of excise, is guilty of an
indictable offence, and hiable to a fine net
exceeding ane hnndred dellars and net less than
fifty dollars, and te imprisonment for a term
net exceeding six months and not less than
three menths.
I cite these illustrations ef the power

which this Senate placed in the hands of inspectors and officers cf the Government a
few days ago without, I presumne, any regard
te the possibility of political bias on the
part cf those Government officials. Yet when
it cornes to the Combines Investigation Act

374

SENATE

honourable members refuse te give even to
the Minister and the Commissioner under that
Act the authority to go ahead and undertake
to secure, in the quiet way in which such
things have been handled in years gone by,
such information as may be necessary to
prove whether or not there is a combine which
is contrary to the interests of the consuming
public. In listening to some of the honourable gentlemen in the Banking and Commerce
Committee one would have thought the Combines Investigation Act had not been of
much moment in the years gone by. I will
admit that a dose of chloroform was administered to it in 1931, and that since that time
it has been moribund, almost dead, doing
nothing because those who were in control
of its operation were unfriendly to it and
unwilling to see donc the things which on the
Statute Book it was said should be done and
which in previous years had been done.
Now let us see what, in brief, was done
under the Combines Investigation Act, for
it would not be improper right here to place
some of the facts on record. In 1926, as a
result of the allegation that a very serious
combine was operating to the detriment of the
public, both producers and consumers. in the
province of British Columbia, an officer was
appointed to go out to that province and
ascertain the facts. He happened to be a
legal gentleman from the city of Toronto.
After he had ascertained the facts and made
his report, in which it was indicated that a verv
serious and detrimental combine against the
public interest was in effect, further action was
taken and the matter was submitted to
the Attorneys-General of British Columbia,
Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba--for the
combine operated in all four of those provinces-with the result that those AttorneysGeneral requested the Federal Government
to assign counsel to prosecute in accordance
with the findings made by the Commissioner.
The final outcome of the prosecution was that
eight persons were fined $25.000 each. and
paid in fines a total of $200.000.
Then we had another alleged combine in
the years 1929 and 1930-the Amalgamated
Builders' Council. As a result of investigation and prosecution in that case the following fines were imposed: on May 12, 1930, one
fine of $10,000, one fine of $3,000, one fine of
$4,000, and one fine of $8,000; on May 26
another fine of $1,000; and on June 18 a further fine of $500. But that did net close that
particular investigation, for in 1931 the following additional fines were imposed: one of
$8,000, one of $1,600, one of $1,100, and an9ther of $8.000.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

Then we had the Electrical Estimators'
Association inquiry, which started in 1930, before the chloroform had been administered,
This resulted in
and concluded in 1932.
fines of $17,500 and $8,700.
Then came the case of the Canadian Basket
Pool, which ended in 1933 with the collection
of fines amounting to $1,500.
Now I come to an important part of the
work of the Combines Investigation Act which
has a direct bearing upon the view which I
hold, that the arguments adduced and the
action taken on this question before the Banking and Commerce Committee indicated to
a great extent that there is one law for the
rich and another law for the poor. We find
that an investigation was launched against
the importers of British coal, and that on
December 12, 1933, it had got to the point
where fines were imposed: one of $5,000, one
of $7,000, another of $5,000, another of $7,000,
and one of $6,000; or $30,000 all told. As
honourable members know, an appeal was
taken and the activities of the department
under the Combines Investigation Act were
questioned. A little later, as a result of the
decision handed down, further fines were imposed of $5,000, $5,000, $2,000, $1,000 and $500.
Why should I say there is one law for the
rich and one for the poor? It is because of
the fact, as I see it, that sitting on the Banking and Commerce Committee was a gentleman who had paid one of those substantial
fines. Why? Because from the pockets of
the poor he had been extracting money to
which he was not entitled, and because it was
held a crime had been committed against
the people of Canada, consumers and producers. But that is net all. Also sitting as
a member of the Banking and Commerce Committee was one of the distinguished legal gentlemen who held views opposite to the views
of the authorities who made the decision
fining his client. Do not take my word for it.
The record will tell the story. It will show
whether he was not most prominent in contending against the further operation of the
Combines Investigation Act and in desiring
to hamstring it, and whether he was not
filled with bitterness and resentment because
the case against his client had been lost, and
because his client had been fined a substantial
amount of money under that Act. The record
will show whether he was not strenuously
arguing against and opposing any action that
would give anybody the right to examine
into the facts of a case and see if there
could be a malefactor in high place or if
it was only among the poor and lowly that
the grafter and the thief were te be found.

APRIL 10, 1937
Such was the position as I observed it while
watching the activities of this committee in
dealing witb this matter.
I do flot want to take up the time of this
Bouse unduiy, because I kn.ow how eager
everybody is to get away. 1 know too that
some distinguished gentlemen d'o flot like to
hear views expressed that are entirely contrary to their hopes and ambitions respecting
wealtby friends.
The question of the propriety of doing
certain tbings under the provisions of the
Combines Investigation Act bas been before
the courts on several occasions. I referred
a littie while ago to the Amalgamated Builders' Council, and to seime of the actions that
had been taken in that connection. In my
judgment there, should- be placed in the
Debates of this Senate, for future reference,
a copy of the records in some of the appeals taken in that matter. I read from
page 134 of the Report of the Departmnent
of Labour for the year ending March 31,'
1932, the section dealing with the Amalgamated Builders' Council, which says:
The Appeliate Division of the Supreme Court
of Ontario heard two appeais from the judgment of Mr. Justice Wright in The King v.
Singer, et ai. Louis M. Singer, Charles E.
Paddon and Herbert Ward appeaied against
their convictions and sentences; but the judgment of the trial judge was sustained. On the
appeai of the Crown against the acquittai of
two other defendants, Beiyea and Weinraub,
president and seeretary of the A.B.C., the
Court of Appeai reversed Mr. Justice Wright's
judgment and imposed a fine of $4,000 on each
of them. The judgment, which was read by
Chief Justice Latchford, was deiivered on
June 26, 1931, and inciuded the foilowing comment on the case:
"That these respondents took an active part
in the original scheme-the conspiracy whicb
formed the basis for the prosecution-is
admitted; the error in iaw, into whioh the
learned judge fell, was in not distinguishing
betwcen the conspiracy itseif and overt acte
which, whie not themselves the conspiracy, were
evidence of the existence of the conspiracy."~
Bon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would my honourabie friend ailow me to intervene? Perhaps 1 am late in doing so. I recognize that
I 'have some resp.onsibiiity for the proper
conduct of procedure in this Chamber, and
I shouid- fot like to be ûccused of being remiss in my duty. I have been wondering
whether there is anything before the Chair,
for if there is nothing this discussion may
be stopped abruptiy. Perhaps I shouid have
put the question myseif when my honourable
friend rose. I do not know what is before
the Chair just now.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: My honourable
leader will, I am sure, recognize the fact that
he was speaking on the Combines Investigation Act. as was also the right honourabie

leader opposite (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
I foilowed them, and I think I should now
be doing less than my duty if I did not take
the first opportunity to present certain views
to this Bouse. If my honourable leader had
not stopped me, I should have been almost
finished by now.
I proceed. After the quotation which I
have just read from the decision of Chief
Justice Latchford I find, further:
The Supreme Court of Canada, in November,
1931, refused icave to appeai against the conviction of Louis M. Singer. The appeai against
the conviction of Belyca and Weinraub was
heard by the Supremne Court in November, and
the judgment of the Court, dismissing the
appeai, w-as delivered by Chief Justice Anglin
in February, 1932. In the resons for judgment
the foiiowing observations were made.
These observations are worthy of the attention of honourabie senators wbo think that
this Bill is an imposition upon the wealthy
person wbo may attempt to double-cross bis
feilow man and unjustly exact money from
him. The judgment reads as foliows:
The foiiowing findings of Wright J., in the
course of his judgment, seem to us to be vital
and ieave no doubt as to the appeilants' guilt.
Moreover, they are ail supported by the evidence. Indeed, as stated by counsel for the
appeilants in his memorandum, the fact-finding
of the learned trial judge w-as good....
If sitting as ai jury, we shouid have no
hesitation in finding that the iliegal acts done
at Windsor ivere a resuit intended hy the
defendants and their f eiiow conspirators when
they formed the organizations found to have
been a combine and a conspiracy. But we do
nlot proceed on this ground, since this wouid
involve making a finding of fact contrary to a
finding of the triai judge....
Hlaving determined that the formation of the
various organizations in question amounted to
the formation of an ilegai combine, and to
a conspiracy within section 498, Criminal Code,
the learned judge proceeded to deai with the
questions as to who had incurred criminal
Be convicted Singer, Paddon
responsibility.
and Ward on evidence which, in our opinion,
clearly implicated Beiyea and Weinraub, in
much the saine manner in which Singer and
bis companions were invoived, in the formation
of the combine and conspiracy in question. Be
felu into error, however, when hie proceeded to
find that it was essential to a finding of guit
of the accused, that they shouid be heid to
have had actuai knowiedge of, or to have
actually participated in, the overt acts at
Windsor.
Mr. O'Connor, somewhat ingeniously, argued
that, where there is an "inferred conspiracy,"
or an "inferred combine," as he termed them,
proof of the existence of which depends largely
on certain overt acts, it its necessary to show
privity of the accused to, or participation by
them in, such overt acts, in order to make them
liable for the formation of the combine or the
conspiracy. This seems to us to be a f aliacy.
The moment it is estabiished that a combine
or conspiracy existed, it is unnecessary, in order
to warrant a conviction of the respondents for

SENATE
the formation of the combine, or of the agreement to conspire, to show their complicity in
subsequent illegal acts done by, or with the
connivance of, the body against members of
which conspiracy or unlawful combine is
charged; provided always, of course, that there
is, in the evidence, sufficient proof of the complicity of the accused in the original formation
of the combine, or in the agreement charged as
conspiracy. Here, the learned trial judge apparently had already found facts from which the
conclusion was inevitable that there was guilt
on the part of Belyea and Weinraub in regard
to the formation of the illegal combine and the
conspiracy, the existence of which he had
already found to be proven. On these findings,
coupled with the admissions made by Belyea
and Weinraub in their testimony, and the
documents of which they were proved to have
knowledge, their convictions, as was held by
the Appellate Division, were a necessary consequence.
There is a great deal more which could be
read and said in respect of that. The point
I want to make is that the Government never
would have brought to task the British
Columbia fruit combine if such views as
expressed by my honourable friend the
senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Côté) and
others had been given effect in the law.
Never under any circuistances could the
Amalgamated Builders' Council have been
fined for their offence against public morality
and decency; never could the Electrical Estimators' Association have been found guilty;
and the importers of British coal would
have been scot-free and high-class citizens
to-day, and not under the shadow because of
a criminal offence having been perpetrated
for which they were fined a large sum of
money. These are the things I want to get
on the record.
But, realizing how desirous honourable
senators are of ndjourning, I will not say
much more at this time. My hope is that
when this matter comes before the Senate
again, as it bas come in the last two or three
sessions, we shall have a real, honest-to-goodness opportunity of entering into all phases
of it and analysing some of the past situations
as well as future possibilities.
I am sorry that the right honourable leader
opposite (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) is not in
his seat at the moment, because I should like
to refer to a remark which he made before I
rose to my feet. I understood him to saythe record will determine whether I am rightthat the Minister had gone back on his word,
had welched on his undertaking. Without any
personal reflection at all upon the chairman
of the committee, I want to say that on
several occasions I saw the Minister indicating
a desire to express his view, but there were
too many lawyers who were as insistent as if
they were protecting a client in a criminal
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

court; so many lawyers attempting to get in
an original and brand-new thought as to
make it impossible to present an argument
which might have been presented had a
chance been given to someone who had some
authority and knew what was behind the whole
question. I am not criticizing the chairman
for tihat. I realize, as a result of observations
at many sittings of that committee, how difficult it is to maintain the fullest regard for
the rights of everyone wbo wants to speak.
But I thought I should be unfaithful to my
past, and, I hope, to my future, did I not
bring to the attention of this House my
humble opinion-which, I know, will not carry
much weight with a number of my distinguished friends-that the whole discussion
of the past few days indicates the firm conviction of some honourable gentlemen that in
this Canada of ours there really should be one
law for the rich and another for the poor.
Hon. A. B. COPP: Honourable senators, I
do not intend to take up any time of the
House in discussing the Combines Investigation Bill. While this discussion was going on
the thought occurred to me, as it did to my
honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand),
who is not now in his seat, that we were not
proceeding properly. I do not think my honourable friend to my left (Hon. Mr. Murdock) need spend very much time in defending the Minister who appeared before our
Banking and Commerce Committee.
This
Bill came to us, was given first and second
reading and referred to that committee. After
consideration at a number of sittings-which
I may say I faithfully attended, although I am
not a member of the committee-the Bill has
been reported to the Senate.
I do not pretend to be an expert on parliamentary procedure, but it seems to me that
the customary way to deal with reports is to
accept or reject 'them. If we accept a report
containing amendments to a bill, the bill as
amended is then sent to the House of Commons for concurrence or rejection as that
House sees fit. If a minister or some other
member of the Commons says he will not
accept an amendment whieh bas been made in
one of our committees, that is no reason why
we should decline to follow our usual procedure.
It is not an uncommon thing to have a conference when the two Houses disagree over
something. I submit we should follow that
procedure now and send the Combines Investigation Bill, as amended by our committee,
to the House of Commons, to be dealt with
there as that House sees fit.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
I am perhaps out of order in rising to speak
on this matter-

APRIL 10, 1937
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The honourable
member is quite in order.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: -but since the honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) made certain statements, I think that
I, in the absence of the right honourable
leader on this side (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen),
have a right to say a word or two. In all
sincerity I want to state it is a matter of
great regret to me, as an individual member
of this House, that every session, and sometimes more than once a session, the honourable senator from Parkdale feels it his duty
to issue a tirade of abuse against people who
do not feel altogether as he does.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I rise to a point
of order. "A tirade of abuse"? Where? When?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: This afternoon.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Will the honourable gentleman indicate one term used by
me which can be construed as a tirade of
abuse?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I might indicate many.
I did not interrupt the honourable senator,
except to call attentionHon. Mr. MURDOCK: My honourable
friend is not going to get away with an untrue statement while I am here.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I have said it, and I
am prepared to back it up, anywhere. Make
no mistake about that.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Well, the statement is unqualifiedly false. I will let the
record stand.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Order!
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The honourable
senator from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Black)
has the floor. I am sure he will answer any
questions that the honourable senator from
Parkdale may ask.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: The whole tenor of
the argument by the honourable senator from
Parkd-ale seemed to be that there was in
the Banking and Commerce Committee an
express desire on the part of the majority to
kill the Combines Investigation Act.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: He mentioned the
lawyers.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: No objection was
entered there on the part of any lawyer or
layman to the Combines Investigation Act
of 1935. That Act is still on the Statute
Book, and if the Bill which we have had before our committee is not passed the Act
will still remain in force and the people of
Canada will be as fully protected by it tomorrow as they are to-day.

377

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That was a wooden
gun, and so is this.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I think it has been
very useful. And let me say this. It occurs
to me that if all combines in Canada were
included within the provisions of the Combines Investigation Act, the honourable senator from Parkdale would not be so enthusiastie
in his condemnation of people who do not
happen to think as he does.
When the honourable gentleman says there
is a desire on the part of this House or any
other House to oppress the poor, I reply that
he is entirely wrong. Speaking for my own
part, as an individual citizen and business
man, I declare that I have never at any time
attempted to oppress anyone unduly.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I did not say that
the honourable gentleman did.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: But the honourable
gentleman said that was the idea of members
of the Banking and Commerce Committee.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I did not. I said
I believed it was the view of certain honourable senators that there should be one law
for the rich and another for the poor. And I
insist on that.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: That is just a part
of the honourable senator's language which
I referred to as abuse, for it contains an
insinuation which is unfair to honourable
members of this Chamber, no matter on what
side they sit. My honourable friend has been,
and still is, so I understand, an official of one
of the largest combines in Canada.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: You are mistaken.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Are you not a member
of the Telegraphers' Union?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I never was.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Are you not a member
of a labour union?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I believe in labour
unions. They are a great benefit to the
public and to themselves so long as they
keep within bounds, just as combines are
good so long as they keep within the law.
My honourable friend from Parkdale has for
many years received a high salary from a
combine which can be used in restraint of
trade just as effectively as a combine of
millers, paper manufacturers or any other
business groups. I am not at all sure, now
that we have leaders of international unions
coming in from other countries to take charge
of our labour organizations, that we had not
better bring labour unions within the scope

378

SENATE

of the Combines Investigation Act. If our
labour unions are to be ruled by somebody
outside our national boundaries, then at least
those unions should be brought within every
restrictive measure, be it the Combines
Investigation Act or any other statute. I arn
inclined to believe that if the suggestion wvere
made that labour unions should corne within
the provisions of the Act, my honourable
friend wvould be the first to declaim loudly
against the suggestion.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: You do not dare
do it.
You are afraid of the political
consequences.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Not at ail. There is
another statement my honourable friend
makes without a sbadow of foundation. H1e
bas no facts to back up bis statement. I say
that is a falsa statament.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The facts speak
for themselves.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Tien please state the
facts.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The facts are that
in the law for many yearsHon. Mr. BLACK: What are the facts to
back up whiat you have just said?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: -there has been a
provision axampting labour organizations.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I admit that.
flot say they were flot axempted.

I did

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: You have been
fearful of attacking that; fearful of the
political consequences.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I suppose that, in
,saying that, you express your own view and
reaction. and the view and reaction uf your
own party. that it would be a mistakai
political.1y to do anything of the kind. Tte
honourable member from Parkdale lias no
righit to impute to me hostility to labour
uions.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question
before the Huse, honourable members, is
the adoption of tha report of the Banking and
Commerce Committee. Discussion as to imputations on any mamber of that committee
iýs not in order, and honourable senators
8hould confine their remarks to the principle
of the motion.
There seems to be in some quarters of the
House an impression that the wording rather
than the method is out of order. I would
cal] attention to section 41, at page 25, of
Forms of Proceedings of the Senate:
If the report contains a Bill with amendments,
it is likawise ordered te ha recaivad,Hon. Mr. BLACK.

It was receivad, of course, wben it was read
by the Clerk.
-and if the amieadments, after being read,
being unimportant or merely formal, are flot
objected to or opposed, the Speaker, after the
explanation of the senator presentiag the report,
says: "Is it your pleasurc, honourable senators,
to coneur in the amandments to this Bil?Thosa in favour of the miotion"...
and so on. That is the motion now being
spokan to.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Mr. Speaker, I insist
on the same latitude as was accorded the
honourable gentleman who spoke nearly threequarters of an hour. I wilI not accept the
ruling- without appeal to the bouse.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Go on.

Hon. Mr. BLACK: I arn just as much
antitled as the honourable senator from Parkdale to take part in the discussion. No one
dislikes parsonalities more than I do. I do
not think any honourable senator has heard
me indulge in personalitias until to-day-if
they were parsonalities. As chairman of the
Banking and Commerce Committee I have
tried to follow very carefully the proceedings
of the committee. From baginning to end of
the inquiry I heard avery sentence uttared
by any member who got on bis feet, and I did
not hear any member of the committee, nor
any honourabla sanator not a member of the
cuîuîîittee, inake a single remark whicb could
be interpretad to mean that hae was opposed
to the Combines Investigation Act. Every
nwrnher, be lie lawyer or layman. bas -the riglit
when a bill is under discussion to say whether
or not hae agrees witli the ternis of any
particular section. I submit in aIl sincerity
that that statement is in accordance withi aIl
that happened bafore the commiýttee.

bon. L. COTE: Will honourable members
allow me for a few minutes to make referenca to something wbich was stated by the
honourable member from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock)? He did me the honour to ref or to
me saveral times during the course of hais
speech, and appeared to be very angry indeed
at-I humbly think-tha useful contribution
I made to the discussion of the Bill before
the Banking and Commerce Committea. In
bis opening remarks the bonourabla member
said that just bafore the committee adjourned
hie heard me yall, "Don't bave public inquiries." Wheraupon hie started to draw conclusions.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:

Did I say "yell"?

Hon. Mr. COTE: Or cry.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: No, nor "r.

APRIL 10, 1937
Hon. Mr. COTE: Or words to that effect.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I said you had
e'stated."
Hon. Mr. COTE: I understood the honourable gentleman to say "yell." I arn glad hie
made use of a better expression.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Look at the record.
Hon. Mr. COTE: I arn prepared to take
his word for it. 0f course, what he said was
not a complote, and therefore nlot an accurate,
report of what I did say.
The economny -of this Bill is well kn.own to
the honourable member froma Parkdale and to
.other bonourable senators. It provides that
in the case of a number of citizens laying
before the Commîssioner under the Act a
rr.ompiaint which points Vo the existence of a
;combine. hie may hold a preliminary inquiry
'if the Minister so directs. If, having done so,
:the Commissioner cornes to the conclusion
that the subjeet of the complaint was frivolous
-or vexatious, and he obtains the consent of his
~Minister, he proceeds no further with the matter. On the other hand, if the preliminary
inquiry reveals a state of affairs serions enough
to warrant a formai investigation, that investigation takes place.
During the discussion before the committec
the Minist-er of the dcpartment and bis officials stated that it was customary nýoV Vo hold
a preliminary inquiry in public. Thereupon
-we asked the Minister whether he would consent Vo that principle being included in the
?Bill. As the committee was about to rise
to-day I ýmovcd, by way of amendment Vo the
amendments aiready carried, that preiiminary
inquiries should not ho held in public, and in
support of my amendmnent it was stated that
it had receivod the concurrence of the MinisVer. As a result of my representation the
amendmnent was unanimously adopted by the
committce. Now, why sbould the bonourable
member from Parkdalo risc in this House and
in tones of reproach refer to the member from
Ottawa as having stated in the committe
that inquiries should not be beid in public?
It is not a fair report of what took place,
and should not be taken as a basis for the
conclusions wbich bie drcw. The honourable
member scems Vo be under the impression
that we senaVors who happen to be lawyers
and give our time Vo the work of the Banking
and Commerce Committec bave somne special
axe Vo grind-Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I did not say that.
Hon. Mr. COTE: -that wc have wealthy
friends. That is quito untrue as far as I am
concernied. I may say that I walked into that
committee and commeniced the study of this

379

Bill having but one guide, or one mastermy own conscience. I was influenced by no
other motive than a desire to serve the public
interest and to see placed on the Statute
Book a law whjch was nlot an affront to
British institutions.
I arn in favour of a Combines Investigation
Act. I am in favour of giving special powers
Vo some judicial officer to conduct investigations as to whether or not a combine exists;
but whenever I give my assent to the granting
of special powers to any officer, I amn also in
favour of clothing the exereise of those powers
with reasonable safeguards. I objected in the
committee to the section which contemplated
giving to the officer or bis deputy the right
to walk into the premises of any citizen of this
country~
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Which you. have
donc in haîf a dozen other Buis.
Hon. Mr. COTE: -to invade bis home in
order to secure documents, and so on. I
believe that such a power should be exercîsed
only wh.en authorized by a person exercising
judicial discretion. It is just a ýmatter of
conviction, not of making one law for the
rich and another for the poor; a matter of preserving in -our statutes an even balance between
our citizens, and safeguarding those principles
of justice upon which the very foundation of
our liberty rests.
The honourahle mprnhpr fren Parkdale will
reüaîl that in this House last year I voted,
as he did, for the repeal of section 98 of
the Criminal Code. A great deal in thal
section was good. The first part of it was
not reprehiensible at ail. Section 98 is the
section which said that sedition was a crime.
It said that it was a -crime to be a member
of an association which. advocated forte and
violence to bring about a governmental
That is sedition.
change in the country.
That is a crime against the State. It is a
crime against His Majesty-a heinous crime.
There was nothing wrong with that part of
the section of the Code which gave that
definition. But that was followed by a provision which stipulated that property, real or
personal. belonging or suspected to belong
Vo such an association-that is, a seditious
association, according to the wording of the
Code-could he seizcd without warrant and
taken into possession by the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police. This section, which had
been paased to protect the country against
the activities of seditious people, enemies of
the State, and seditious ýconspiracies, was
assailed fromn one end of the country Vo the
oCher. It was made part of the politie.aI
platform of a party on the grouýnd that somte
of its provisions invaded -the right of the

38U

SENATE

individual. I think I remember the Minister
of Justice in the present Government stating
that an Engýlishman's house was bis castie,
and that he, the Minister, was going to see
to it that section 98 was repealed. Mind you,
I ar n ot discusaing the merit of bis argument. I agreed with hima f0 the extent of
voting for the repeal of section 98; and now,
after the electors of the country have given
the Goveroment a mandate to come to Parliament and have that section of the Criminal
Code repealed on the ground that it is an
invasion of the rights of the home and of
the man, we are being asked under the Combines Investigation Act to ýadopt the same
principle.
The Acta whicb my honourable frîend
quoted a few moments ago are different from
the Combines Investigation Act. Tbey are
not criminal legislation, but this Act is; and
it contains the definition of a crime. This
Act is organized for the purpose of deteeting
crime and punishing the criminal, and in that
lies the difference.
In any event, we were being asked in this
Bill, a Bill respectiog criminal law, to adopt
the samne principle that ivas contained in section 98, and because we are lawyera we have
no right, accordiug f0 the honourable gentleman from Parkda]e (Hon. Mr. Murdock), to
have an opinion, t0 have a conscience, or to
undertake to get up in a committee of this
bouse to say that while we are not opposed
to the principle of the Combines Investigation Act, there are certain features we shou]d
like to see amended.
I arn not going to
attempt to say wbat are the motives of the
bonourable member from Parkdale.
I do
not know. As a matter of fact, I arn rather
puzzled and perplexed by the speech he made.
Wben ho stood up and tried to give the
impression that the lawyvers on the committee
and the member for Ot tawa East (Hon. Mr.
Côté) were against the Combines Investigation Act and in favour of one law for the
pool- and another for the ricb, be waa doing
something he had no rigbt to do, and whicb
was neither fair nor based on fact.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
The bonourable
senator missed the gist of my contention. It
was that he and bis friends-particularly bis
friends-had planned that the Act would be
no good, and for six years had made sure
that it would be no good.
Hon. ARTHUR SAUVE

House. To hear the bonourable senator speak,
in quix ering tories. one rnigbt think the
members on this aide of the House were
friends and protectors of trusts, and the
membera on the other aide their enemies.
That is not juat, truc or intelligent.
I was ready to support the Bill with the
amendment which bad been accepted by both
parties, as it was reported to this House by
the right bonourable leader of the Left.
If there is a man wbo bas fought the trusts
and suffered politically thereby, it is your
humble servant. I have fought tbem with ail
the energy I could command. I fought them
in -the Legislatcîre of my province, wbere I
saw their intentions and their nefanious work.
The resuits of their audacity and rapacity are
evident. Trusts are one of the main causes
of our social disorders.
It is not enough to
denounce tbem; tbey must be destroyed, or
controlled by effective laws.
The people are complaining of the abuses
to whicb tbey are subjected. Tbey grumble
and tbreaten. They feel strongly against the
trusts, to which they ascribe their ilîs.
There is a tendency to confuse capital, wbich
is essential to private enterprise. with capitalism, the great social enemy, the centralîzer
and monopolizer of production and sale.
I amn in favour of such legislation as will
provide the most efficient protection against
the abuses of monopoly. Such a law is necessary. But abuses should not be comhated by
other abuses. Such is the point of the lest
dlispuIte, andI I regret that the Minister who,
sponsored the Bill should have withdrawn
bis word, of which an boneat interpretation
was previously given by the bonourable leader
of the Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Commerce had concluded its labours on Bill

that the Minister of Labour, while dîssenting
from the principle embodied in my right

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I congratulate
the leader of the Government, and the Government, on the stand they have taken. I
certainly support the motion for concurrence.
As I appreciate the position, the Government
intends te accept the amendments in the
Commons; which, of course, is the only
consistent thing te be done. It is really
pleasant te reflect that when we do get down
te realities there is a high sense of honour on
both sides of the House.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
The motion was agreed te.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.
EXCISE BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 119, an Act te amend the
Excise Act, 1934.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable senators, as this Bill
bas just passed through the House of Commons, I am without any brief explaining it.
I hope that my right honourable friend who
leads the other side will, upon going through
it, accept the assurance that it passed the
other Chamber without any criticism. It is
my impression that the Bill is consequential
upon the budget adopted in the other
Chamber, though some of the clauses may not
be. I might perhaps state that it seems to
cover the internal administration of the Act
by the department.
The first amendment is intended te make it
clear that all officers engaged in «inspection
work under the Act or in the administration
or enforcement thereof have the status of
"officers."
The only change is indicated by
the words underlined at the end of the
paragraph:
and every person employed for the purpose of
the administration or enforcement of this Act,
including any members of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police.
The next amendment provides that duties
overpaid or erroneously paid may be refunded
by the Minister if application in writing is
made within three years from the date of

381

payment. It is also intended to preclude
applications for refund where the written
application is not made within three years of
the payment.
Certain spirits are subject to abatement,
and the next amendment is intended to
provide for wineries a schedule of abatements
for shrinkage by evaporation similar to those
allowed te distilleries under section 142. This
is limited, however, to one year's storage.
Clause 4 of the Bill declares:
All persons employed for the purposes of
this Act, including members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, shall be known as officers
of excise.
Clause 5 makes it an offence to refuse to
assist officers in the execution of their duty.
This amendment in intended to include in the
offence of refusal to assist the officers in enforcing the Act, the failure te stop a vehicle,
vessel or other conveyance when required to
do so by an officer of excise. This follows the
language of an existing provision of the Customs Act.
Clause 6 is a clerical amendment intended
te clear up an error in typographical arrangement of paragraphs (a) and (b) and also to
define more clearly the punishment referred
te in paragraph (b).
Clause 7 has te do with licences and the
amount of bond required. It is considered
that a bond in the amount of $1,000 is
adequate security against chemical stills being
utilized for the illegal manufacture of spirits.
Clause 8 is intended te reduce the licence
fee for chemical stills from $25 to $2, and,
further, te provide exemptions from the licence
fee te public hospitals.
The object of clause 9 is te reduce the
licence fee required of a manufacturer or
importer of a still from $20 te $2.
Clause 10 is intended te clarify the reading of the section by supplying words inadvertently omitted in the second proviso of one
paragraph.
Clause 11 gives statutory sanction te the
validation fee imposed by Order in Council
in December, 1933.
There are then some technical clauses,
which I think I need net read to the Senate.
Clause 17 is intended te clarify the Minister's power te license and control the traffic
in specially denatured alcohol, with a view
to preventing its use as a beverage.
Clause 19, the last clause to which I need
refer, provides penalties for violating provisions of the Act and regulations.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, I am not in a position to say
that I have any criticism of the Bill, but I do

382

SENATE

think it is unfortunate that this measure
comes to us so late in the session. The Bill
is a long one. Many of its clauses are qualifying provisions, but some of them are important. This is a measure which could be
very usefully gone over in one of our committees. I do not just know what the effect
of certain amendments might be. I draw
attention, though, to section 13. This provides for a new offence and is a rather important section. It says:
The said Act is further amended by inserting
immediately after section 169A thereof, the
following section:
169B. If any two or more persons are found
together and they or any one of them have in
their or his possession any spirits liable to
seizure under this Act, each of such persons
having knowledge of the fact of such possession
is guilty of an offence and punishable in accordance with the provisions of this Act as if the

goods were found in his possession.
That is a most drastic provision. Suppose,
for example, A, who never indulges, calls on
his friend B, and while they are sitting talking
B confidentially says, "Now, this stuff that
we have on the table is made by me at
home." At that very moment an excise officer
comes in. A immediately becomes liable for
heavy penalties. Under this section an entirely innocent man might be found guilty.
I should like to see some defence of the provision. The explanatory note says:
This amendment is intended to make all
persons who are found together with the person
committing an offence under subsection 1 of
section 169 equally guilty of the same offence
if they have knowledge of their companion's
possession of the spirits of illicit manufacture
or importation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have received
this explanation from the department:
It frequently happens that several persons
are found together in possession of spirits of
unlawful manufacture or importation. When
faced with individual charges or with a joint
charge they invariably connive to have one of
their number claim ownership, with the result
that the other charges are dismissed. On many
occasions to the knowledge of the officers the
person claiming ownership is not the real owner,
but one who, for a consideration, is willing to
take the fall.
The amendment is identical with section 213
of the Customs Act, which reads as follows:
"If any two or more persons in company are
found together and they or any of them have
any goods liable to forfeiture under this Act,
every such person having knowledge of the
fact is guilty of an offence and punishable in
accordance with the provisions of this Act, as
if the goods were found on such person."
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I cannot see
any distinction between this section and the
provision which my honourable friend bas just
read from the Customs Act. It seems to me
at the moment that the two sections are
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

equally bad. I realize, though, the difficulties
that officers have when, believing several persons to be guilty, they can charge only one.
But proof of guiit is essential before a man
can be held as a criminal. It is going pretty
far to assume that a fellow is guilty if caught
in such circumstances as I referred to a few
moments ago. I presume that if this section
is passed everybody will have to run out of a
place as soon as any liquor is mentioned. If
it is of any interest to honourable members of
the House, I think we may safely assume that
the persons liable under this section are always
poor men, not big interests.
Section 19 also is undoubtedly important. It
provides penalties for violating provisions of
the Act and regulations. The explanatory note
says:
This amendment is intended to provide a
complete and graduated penal section to enforce
the provisions of the Act and the regulations
made thereunder respecting all alcohols that
might be used for beverage purposes.
I do not say the section is wrong, but it is
very drastic. Of course, I realize that drastic
provisions are essential in cases of this kind.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We might pass
this Bill and give it a trial in actual practice.
If it results in abuses we can correct them

FIRST READING

The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: 'Honourable
senators, with leave, I move the second reading of the Bill now. This measure is consequential upon the budget that was adopted in
the~ other House. The schedules indicate
the tariff items and cover a wide range of
changes.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Which are
the furniture items?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have a vague
impression that there is an increase of dties,
which will do less violence to the pyrinciples of
my right honourable friend than to mine.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, as I sat reading this measure
I could not but lamnent that the clarion voice
of our old and dear friend, the late Dr.
Michael Clark, could not be heard upon this
Bill. I sec it fixes duties up to 45 per cent
on many limes of manufactured articles. I
know, though I have not observed the particular items, that the Bill very substantially
raises the tariff on furniture. I judge that
in the sehedules there are three or four
hundred articles apparently entitled to the
henevoient eye of the Government. This is a
loud, resounding proclamation of the value
cf protection in this country.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: One cannot
)ut admire the steady progress made by the
loctrine, e-specially when it reaches the master
mind of the present Minister of Finance.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: We ail change
our minds on that.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What a long
road we have travelled from the days of his
early speeches in the province of Saskatchewan!
But ail this is to bis credit. It is just an
illustration of the mighty and irresistible
power of truth. Enlightenment marches on
silently, but without impediment, like the
spreading light of dawn.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I was not
directly in the fray in September, 1878--I
think, the 17th-when the National Policy
carried the day under John A. Macdonald,
as hie then was. -against the Government whieh
had at its head Alexander Mackenzie. But
for some years after entering the political
field-should I say as an amnateur?-for I was
a law-student of about nineteen years of age,
I am ashamed to say-I took part in the
campaign for freer trade. I remember my
first speeches bore on Protection and Free
Trade and the construction of the Canadian
Pacifie Railway. 0f economics I thought then
1 knew more than I know to-day. 0f course
I had read Bright's and Cobden's speeches,
and 1 observed that the only justification for
protection would be in a young country where
itwas desired to establish industries in
competition with industries in a highly
industrialized neighbouring country. But wc
were warned: "Be careful about those native
industries. The more they grow, the more
they will dlaim the privilege of protection
against foreign competition." It would be
interesting to, know how many of the industries
establishcd under the National Policy in 1879
have not insisted on and obtained larger and
still larger measures of protection. My right
honourable friend is quite correct in suggesting that. as we on this aide are for freer trade,
we should be the champions of tariff reduction.
Well, I think that we have not been altogether
remias in our duty in that direction.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: With many
exceptions.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We have in our
modifications of the Ottawa agreements tried
to reduce tariff rates, and we have done so
in our reciprocity convention with the United
States. Wc are carrying out the samne principle in our trade agreements wîth other
countries to which we grant, and by which
we are granted, most-favoured-nation treat..
ment. I remember an cloquent speech by
my honourable friend from Montarville (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien) ini which hie argued that this
most-favoured-nation treatment clause produced reduction of duties, and that this reduction was detrimental to our industries.
0f course, a Government must face present
conditions. Industries have been cstablished
which give cmployment to thousands of
workmen, and in any revision of duty we
must proceed prudently so as flot to disturb
violently the prevailing conditions.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The increase
in furniture duties is made, I suppose, so as
not to disturb that industry violently.

384

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I had some data
on the furniture industry. I think the Tariff
Board made a report on various manufacturing industries, furniture being one of them.
The Board recommended a slight increase in
duties on furniture and a considerable
decrease in duties on other commodities.
The Government is now implementing the
recommendation.
We could, I suppose, sit here for hours
checking every item to see if the duty imposed
is justified. I will not undertake that task
at this moment. I will content myself with

BUSINESS

OF THE SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senators, I understand that the only other
legislation to come from the Commons is the
Supply Bill. If I am allowed a few minutes,
I shall ascertain to what hour we can adjourn
the present sitting.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Honourable
members, though this side of the House is
reinforced by the honourable senator from
Rockcliffe (Hon. Cairine Wilson), both sides
are leaderless. Our leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) has gone to ascertain the proper time to
have the Senate meet again. As there are very
few members here to receive that information,
I think we had better call it 6 o'clock. His
Honour the Speaker can have the bell rung
when we are to reassemble.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: I think the honourable leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) said that ýthere was more legislation to come from the other House, and
that he was going to see when it would be
received here.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: There is only
the Supply Bill.

SENATE

Convinced that recovery is dependent upon
the development of trade, my Ministers have
pursued their efforts to negotiate agreements
with countries willing to trade with Canada
on a reciprocal basis.
The trade agreement concluded between Canada and the United Kingdom has received your
approval, and effect has been given to the
changes in the custome tariff for which it made
provision. Ensuring as it does a freer exchange
of commodities, through a lowering of trade
barriers, the new agreement will, it is believed,
bring substantial benefits to producers and consumers alike. It will serve as well to strengthen
understanding and goodwill between the United
Kingdom and the Dominion.
Approval bas also been given to a trade
agreement with Uruguay and to a provisional
trade agreement with Germany. Progress has
been made in negotiations with the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia for
the revision of the existing agreement with
that country.
Special provision has been made for the
promotion of the sale of farm products.
Appropriate action bas been taken to give
effect to conventions between Canada and the
United States for the preservation of the
sockeye salmon and Pacifie halibut fisheries.
With a view to fostering increased activity
and employment in the construction industries,
an Act bas been passed to facilitate the granting
of loans to finance improvements in rural and
:urban homes. Provision bas also been made
for the extension of the work of farm rehabilitation in the drought areas of Western Canada,
for assistance to the fishing industry, and, in
co-operation with the provinces, for the further
alleviation of unenployment and agricultural
distress.
Provision bas been made for pensions to
blind persons wbo have attained the age of
forty years.

Measures have been enacted to provide for
the establishment of a trans-Canada air service,
and for revision of the capital structure of the
Canadian National Railways.
More effective provision has been made for
the defence of Canada.
Measures have been enacted to prevent enlistments from this country in foreign wars, and
to provide for the control of exports of
munitions and war materials. The profound
desire of the Canadian people to discourage
resort to armed force and to promote peace
has found further expression in departmental
measures to control profits in the manufacture
of defence equipment and supplies.
In the opinion of my Ministers, economic and
social developments since Confederation necessitate readjustments in the governmental structure of Canada. As a necessary first step, it
has been decided to appoint a royal commission
of inquiry to investigate the allocation of
financial powers and responsibilities as between
the Dominion and the provinces.
The Coronation of Their Majesties King
George the Sixth and Queen Elizabeth, on May
the twelfth, is an event of unprecedented significance to the nations of the British Commonwealth. Arrangements are being completed for
the appropriate representation of Canada at
the ceremonies.
Canada will also be duly represented at the
Imperial Conference to be held in London
immediately following the Coronation.
Members of the House of Commons:
I thank you for the provision you have made
for the public service.
Honourable Members of the Senate:

Members of the House of Commons:
In taking leave of you at this time, I pray
that the blessing of Divine Providence may rest
upon your labours.
