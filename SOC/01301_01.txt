0F SELECTION.

Hon!"8Sr JAMES LOUGHEED presented
the report of the Committee of Selection appointed to nominate senators te serve on
-the several Standing Committees during
the present session. He said: As the report is rather lengthy, I shall not read it,
but will move that it be considered te-morrow, aud in the meantime it will be printed.
It may not be out ol place for me te say
that the committee on, this occasion found
it necessary te make a readjustment te
some extent of the committees with which
we were empowered to deal. That readjuetment is due to tliis fact: the amendment
te the British North Amerlos Act giving
additional representation te the West in
the Senate, as honourable gentlemen will
recaîl, came inte force upon the dissolution of Parliament, and this session, finds
that amendinent in operation.
Consequently nine new senaters were appointed
in addition te thoee appoitments. which.
had already been made te fill vacancies.
Four groups 'were thus created, of 24 meembers each, from the different sections of
Canada-24 from the Maritime Provinces,
24 fromn Quebec, 24 f rom Ontario, and a
like number from the four provinces west
of the Great Lakes. To give an equal representation to each group on each cornmittee involved, as honourable gentlemen
will readi]y understand, a f ew readjustments. We gave every consideration te the
older members who had constituted the
commiittees, and honourable gentlemen,
upon looking over the Minutes to-morrow,
when printed, will observe, 1 hope, that
no very serions readjustment has taken
place. I considered it desirable te aake
this explanation so that if soine honourable gentlemen find that they are not on ahi
the committees to which they were formerly
appointed they will understand the reason.

Hon. D. 0. L'ES'PERANCE rose ta mnove
that an Addiress be presentec to Hic,
Excellency the Governor General ta ofler
the humble thankis of this House to His
Excellency for the gracious Speech whichi
hie h.as been pleased toi make ta bath Houses
o! Parliament. He said:
(Translation) Honourable gentlemen: 1
highly appreciate the honour which has
been done me by the honourable leader
of the House in inviting me Vo propose tbe
Address ta be presented ta His Excellency
the Governor General.
I take this opportunity, Mr. Speaker,' ta
affer you my most sincere congratulations
and ta tell you bow pleased 1 ain ta see
yau ag-ain occupying the high office which
you filled with such dîgnity and distinction
during the closing session of the hast ParIn asking you ta continue as
liament.
Speaker of this House, the honourable
leader of the Government gives you an
evidence o! esteem and confidence which
does you honour and which, I have no
doubt, will be bighly appreciated by your
cu mpatriots.
Four years wiul soion hiave passed by
since Oanada, an autonomous Dominion
within the British Empire, decided, by the
unanimous and freely-expressed *will of its
Pailiament, ta take part in the conflict
which was ta involve the greatest nations
of the world and tax ta its uttermost limnits
the energy, the endurance and the spirit
of sacrifice of peophes. When the special
session was called at the beginning o! the
present confliet I was a member o! the
other House, and there is still present in
my memory the unanimous enthiusiasmi
with wh.ich the war programme subiinitted
by- the Government of the day was
received.
The decision taken at the beginning of
the war by the representatives of the
people expressed well the intentions of
their constituents, for, alter four -years
w'hich have
and sacrifice
eff ort
of
bc-en the admiration of aur Allies and
the astonishment o! aur enemies, the
Canadian people have just decided unanixnousiy ta continue this effort until the
end. It is advisedly, Mr. Speak~er and
honourable gentlemen. that 1 isay unanwrously; for even those who bave been
eTcted in opposition ta the Military Service Act have ne vertheless received tl•e
mandate ta support, by other naeans, the
cause of the Allies until the final victory.
Nat a single candidate, ta imy know.ledge,

furled the standard ol non-intervention.
Some, lt is true, favoured different nieans,
but ail have been eager tea place at the
head of their programme the continuation
of our efforts.
It was therefore wrong for a certain section of the press, during the laie campaign
and since, to attempt to take advantage of
prejudices against my native province.
Sonie went so far as to apply the epithet of
traitor to a people who are generou s, lawabiding, loyal to the British Crown, and
prepared to make the greatest sacrifices for
thc- defenoe of their liberties and of the
land which gave thom birth. Against these
erroneous and mendacious accusations 1 deTthat
sire to make an emphatic protest.
there have been extravagances o4 language,
that unfortunate and regrettable occurrences
have taken place in the course of the
last election campaign, caninot be denied.
But these manifestations are inherent in
our governmental system and accompany
in ail parts o! the British Empire the exercise by the people of their sovereign right.
May I be pemnitted, before passing to another subject, .to express -a wish: it, is thait
at the dawn of the present Parliament, at
the beginning of this year, which from present indications. -vill be s0 mornentous iii
consequences for the sublime cause we are
aefending, this bonourable Ghamber, the
higbest ini the land, will give an example *of
tolerance, unity and concord .among the different elements coamposing the Canadian
nation ta whicb we are so proud ta belong.
The Military Service Act is in force; its
macbinery, though somewhat complicated.
i- working in g-Ood order. The application
of this law is necessarilxr slow, for it wvas
enacted for the puipose of keeping our miiitary forces up to stren-th, without, bowever, doing injury ta our essential industries, cbiefiv agriculture, the intensive development of whîch is s0 necessary ta the
succes-s of 'the Allies. The judges called
upon ta decide the nuTmnerous appeals for
exemprtion submitte-d ta their jurisdiction
do welà ta proceed with prudence; this ýwise
procedure will douibtie-ss entail regrettable
delays, but these delays are justifiable from
the standpoint.of the vital interests o! the
country.
The great proibdeqms which the Speech
from the Throne brings to our attention and
uponwhich we sýhal (be called ta deliberate,
have for their principal abject the ca-ordination of aur efforts and aur 'means for the
prosecution of the war, due regard being,
hoýwever, paid to the after-4war prdlblems,
leas urgent, but none the less important, if

MARCH 19, 1918

.

we svoeld not lose the fruits of our present
sacrifices.
Among the most important items in the
programme suibmitted for our attention I
observe, in passing, those whieh relate to
our sources of revenue, agricultural iproduction, and the refon of the Outside Civil
Service.
The Government is obliged to find the
revenue necessary for the carrying out of
the programme of which the people have
just approved in no uncertain ters. The
financial measures adopted since the Ibeginning of the war, Iby the Government, under
the wise administration of Hon. Sir Thomas
White, whom I am pleased to see again in
charge of our finances, have given all the
results expected of them, and even more,
without, however, retarding the dtvelopment oif our industries or causing serious inconvenience to individuals.
With the continuance of the war it wilà
doufbtless Ibecome necessary to find other
sources of revenue. or to increase the
revenues already existing. I arn convinced
that the present Governiment, like its predecessor, will 'be alble to make this legislation as wise, as prudent, and as efficacious
as it onght to be. It will be our duty to
study these measures, keeping in mind the
resources and the needs of the country.
Since 1912 the Federal Governmaent has
asked Parliament to vote annually certain
sums of money for the encouragement of
agriculture. These sums are voted iU the
form of special subsidies to the provinces,
and are expended through the respective
provincial governments. Recently there %was
held in the Capital a conference of the
prime ministers of the different provinces,
to discuss, as I understand, the best means
of increasing agricultural production.
An effective means of encouraging this
production would be, in my humble opinion,
to guarantee to the farmer a minimum price
for his -products,- whether wheat or other
cereals, cattle, meat, butter, cheese, or
vegetables. Cultivation is more expensive
now than before the war. The price of everything is higher-labour, farm implements,
seed grain, etc. Is it more reasonable to
ask the farmer to arrange at great expense
for an increase in the yield of products the
prices of which might be seriously affected
by a sudden ending of the war, than it
would be to ask the manufacturer to buy at
increased cost materials for the manufacture
of, munitions without guaranteeing him a
reasonable price for his output?
The Speech from the Throne apprises us'
that legislation will be introduced for the

5

reform of the Outside Civil Service; that is,
to remove from political influence the appointments to the various departments of
the Government. Those especially who
have been members of the other House will
properly appreciate -this salutary reform.
Competition for appointment and -the pressme brought to bear upon members of Parliament had beceme really tyrannical.
Moreover, the people's representatives were
subjected to violent attacks, mostly unjustified, with regard to the exercise of this
patronage. The reforn of the Outside Civil
Service will therefore have two direct results. The first and the more important
will be the improvement .of the Service by the classification and selection of
employees, not according to political merit,
but in conformity with the qualifications required by the Civil Service Commission; the
other, which I have just mentioned, will be
the relief of menibers of Parliament from
a task which the majority of them accepted with resignation as one of the necessary
evils of public lfe.
I desire, before concluding these few remarks, to express my appreci'ation of the
Government's
naval construction programme as announced a few weeks ago by
the Hon. Charles Ballantyne, Minister of
Marine. I can state without exaggeration
that all true patriots were thrilled with
joy and pride at the announcement of this
bold policy, the realization of which vill
have a considerable influence* upon our
destiny. The development of our merchant
marine will inevitably bring about the coordination of all our means of transportation, insure the maintenance and growth
of our foreign trade, promnote the prosperity of our seaports, and comipensate in
large measure for the material sacrifices
we siall have made during the present war.
I desire, therefore, to congratulate the
Government. and more especially the honourable Minister of Marine, who was the
man best fitted to give effect to a programme

so

extensive.

Not wishing to impose upon the patience
of this honourable House, I pass over in
silence several subjects mentioned in the
Speech from the Throne, and not the least
important. I leave to the honourable seconder of the Address in reply the task of
dealing with such questions as railways,
immigration and colonization, which are of
such keen interest to the Western Provinces.
I desire te thank you, Mr. Speaker, as
well as .my honourable colleagues, for the
attent-ion which has been given to my
humble words, and before taking my seat

SENATE

I wilh, with your permission, say a few
words in the language which is that of the
majority in this House.
Homourabie gentlemen, foliowing a custom
established since Confederation, I -was
proud to address the flouse, at aucb am,
important tiine, ini my native tongue. But
I arn bo>und te say that it is somewhat
depressing for one te feel that the language
ho speaks is net understood by the great
majority of bis hearers. I trust, however,
that the polioy of u.sing alternately both
of the official languages, for the moving
arnd the eeconding of the Address, wilh be
etriclfly adheied te vwith only one possible
alteration: that is, I hope that the use of
the French Janguage in the Paîliament
'wihl not foieveî be restricted te members
of French origin. Following the great and
terrible war that bas so chosely bound together our immortal mother countries,
France and Englanid, i.9 it too much to
expect that the sweet language of France
will become more popular and w ilI biereafter be more universalIy taugbit in tbis
country, so that we may better understand
each other and reahize that lasting and
fruitfuh union dreamed of by the fathers of
Confederation.
Hon. EDWARD MICHENER: Honourable gentlemen, I have the honour te second the resolution so sbly presented by the
honeurable member who bas just spoken.
I desixe toý asseciate myseif with the expression which he gave with respect te Mr.
Speaker; also, te affirm our eontinued and
sincerest loyalty to His Gracieus Mai esty
and bis representative in our Dominion,
His Excellency the Duke of Devonshire.
Western Canada bad the honour of a visit
frorn His Excellency last faîl. We were
especially pleased to learn of bis keen
interest in the agricultural possibilitiee sud
development of Canada.
I 6hould hike, before proceeding, te refer
te one remark which was made by tbe
honourable gentleman who moved the resolutien, toward.s tbe close of his speech.
He expressed the hope that tbe day would
corne when every meinher of the House
would understand botb languages. I regret
exceedingly that I was not able te follow
all that -the honourable member eaid in bis
native tengue, but I stated te him, and
wish te state te the Ho-use, that I amn geing
to, see te it that my sons sh ail net be
handicapped in this way.
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE.

When I see about me lienourable gentlemen of long and distinguished parliamentary service and experience, when 1
recall the statesmen who have as members
of this House contributed so much to the
upbuilding of a greater Canada, 1 appre.
ciate the honour of having a place in the
counisels of the Senate of Canada. We who
have recently been called too the Upper
bouse cari have no more worthy or impelling purpose than te ernulate the example of the illustrions men who have
given s0 unstintingly and loyally of their
time and energies to the service of their
country.
~Not since Confederation has the Parlismentof Canada been charged with such tremendous responsibilities as now confront
them, in the pro>secutien of the struggle for
the, preservation of our libei'ties. Not only
bas the Governrnent the mighty task of
carrying on the war, but by resson of the
war great social and economic questions are
arising -which must command the attention of Parliarnent.
We endorse with all our hearts the sentiment *expressed in the Speech fxom
the Throne, -"that ithe effort which yet
lies before ne demands our sternest
re6olve, but we shahl net shrink irom
it, if oui hearts -are as firm and oux
courage as undaunted as those of oui countrymen wbo hold our battie line beyond thé
seas." If I interpret aright the spirit of
the people of Canada, it is th-at the heaits
of the people are with t.he men at the front.
and they are prepared&te back them up to
the full strength of Canads's power. Men,
munitions, and mo>ney are not enough for
Canada to belp win the wax. We must put
olir fulîl strength, our hesit, our seul, into
the struggle as a united people. We must
he possessed of the sarne spirit of service
and sacrifice as our galiant men wvho have
placed their lives upon the altar of their
country.
The iSpeech refers te the Canadian Expeditionary Force as stilh maintaining its
unbroken record of distinguîshed achievement. 0f this fact we as Canadians are
justly proud. In ahl the strategical engag-ements of the war thus far our men
ihave neyer failed to make the top. The
enemy have recognized their daring and
heroism by placing again-st the Canadian
forces the best regimen-ts-of the Prussian
Guards. Our forces at the hattie line have
shown snch an unswerving purpose te live
Up to the highest traditions of soldiers and
patriots tihat they have merited a lasting
honour and glory for Canada amnong 'the

MARCH 19, 1918
has the responsibility of Canada been as
great as to-day. The fate of the allied
cause rests with Great Britain, lier domiinions and our great ally Vo the south. The
eastern situation is dark indeed. Russia
is broken and lias become an easy prey for
RLumania, Poland,
German aggresian.
Serbia, and Italy can do no more than
defend what is left. Gallant Beigiumn, that
held the Germain hordes back sa heroically
at the ibeginu.ing, is despoiied, outraged,
and ravislied. Brave and brilliant France
la putting her ail in the struggie, fighting
for lier existence. IV remains for Britain.
Canada and te United States Vo -put fortih
their full strength for the restoration of the
heritage oL the despoiied nations, for the
destruction cf uiliîtarismn, and for making
te wcorld*safe for demccracy. With an-ailconquering faitit in our cause, cur armies
and navy and in cur God, we will conquer
or die.
The Speech refers to te extension of
the present Civil Service Act Vo the Outside
Service, so that promotions and appointments will be made solely on merit and
efficiency. This is esipeciaily opportune, in
view o! the demand of the times for the
-Govern.ment ta assume larger powers and
obligations in uudertaking as national enterprises more cf the pu~blie utilities cf the
country.
The creation cf two new departments cf
the Governmnent will ieet witli the approval cf the people. The first, that cf LImmigration and Colonization, is pregnant
witit possi>biiities. What Canada needs is
population cf the right kind ta develop her
lands and resources. The province cf Aiberta, fromn which I corne, alone has sufficient land and resources Vo sustaun a population larger than te wihoie cf Canada today. We need people Vo help develop ail
Our great natural assets; but we want peopie who will become Canadians, %vhocan
appreciate Canadian aims, ideais, traditions, and institutions.. Immigration lias

,Since we met last sessîion, the honourable

upon huim Mt -bsing plraced in charge o4! a

this House in sucb -a way as tlhie members

MARCH 19, 1918
of this Ho'u6e considered that fie shosuld
be hionou'red. For a number of years
he bais done a great, deaJ of 'work
at the head of cofnmisons, and bas carried on lîlsis work with great satisfaction
to the country and to those 'who have corne
in contact with hian. I amn sure that we
are ail prepured te congratulate him most
heartily upon bis new honour; but at -the
sarne tume I hardly think we can congratulate him on the titie by which
he should be addTessed-the honourable
Minister of So-idiers' Civil Re-stablishmnent, whih-h is a very long titie; and
although we know that he 'will fulfil
thoroughly the duties of the office te which
he bas been appointed, at the saie time
we must -comnmiserate with him upon tbhe
title selected. In view of -the work which
he has done in the past, -and the.excellent
way in which he fias oarried it eut, I think
a betfer titie would have been the Mdnister
and Friend of tihe Soidiers. I wrn sure
that he will do ail lie can to look after
the interests of lhose mren who have 'heen
doing such -splendid work for the country,
in helping theni to take their place ini the
if e of the country when they return f rcm
the front.
I- wisb, to congratulate, tihe Ïhonouira.ble gentleman from Welland <Hon.
Mr.
Robertson)
upon
att.aining
the
position of Privy Countoillor.
At. the
present time the ihonouraýble gentdinnan
lias not a portfolio; buit I *know tihat
he lhas a great deal of werk te do, and,
although. he has not been long a niember
cf this Chamber, 'we ail appreciate the
way in which hiG 'worth and ability have
heen recognized by the Government.
The Speech frei the Throine te which oux
attention is called to-day deals with
a vcry large nuniber cf questiîons.
1
do not propose te take them aIl up in
order. I wish to deal with onlv those
whi.ch are perhaps the mest important to
consider at the present tume. Since we last
met in. this Chamiber the condition of things
in Europe bas, I regret, te say, mot imnproved
froma the peint cf view cf the Allies. I think
it is unfortunate that the success cf the
Central Powers, owing te the' regrettable
situation that has arisen in Russia, bas been
such as te bring te the people of the Central Powers the hope that they may be able
te retrieve the position in which, they found
themsîves in the middle cf last year. The
situation in Rusa is one that we nmust ail
-regret sincerely. We had hoped that some
effective organization would have been. developed out-of the circumstances that arose

9

when the revolution. took place in Russia
and that sorne &trong man would be found,
able to take charge of -affaire in that coun.try and organize the people te carry on the
fight for liberty and democracy; but it
seenia, unfortunately thet the forces whicb
were behind the leaders were -not of the
right kind, and the men themselves had not
received -the training that is neces.sary for
men occupying such positions. The resuit
has been that the Russian people are today in a condition that every one who takes
an interest in that country must very sincerely regret and un.fortunately, -theCentral
Powers of Europe are to-day able to a very
great extent to force their will upon the
Russian people -and 'will be, 1 fear, able te
recuperate and gain in strength from the
supplies, the ammunition, and oither resources which will be available to them. This
whole situation will have ù serions effect.
It will mean that the allied -nations must put
forward grea-ter efforts in order to accomplish their object, and to bring -about the
resui-t for which we ail fervently hope, the
termination of this terribleistruggle in which
the world is now engaged.
We realize
to-day* that the interests of every country
in the world are bound up with the existing
condition of things and that no country can
afford te stand out of-this terrible etruggie;
every country must makze its decision and
take its place on one side or the other. It
behooves the people of every country to
realize the situation 'and to bend every
effort in their power to bring abou-t a victorious 1conclusion of the struggle for libe.rty
and the triumph of demnocracy throughout
the world.
Sînce we last met in -this Chamber we have
bad Vhroughout Canada a general election
and the people have'decided that Union
Government is in their opinion the best
form in whîch the government -of the country can be carried on, and -the form in
which for the present it ought to be
carrîed on. As my honourable friend
from the Gulf <Hon. Mr. L'Esperance)
said in his speech, the only difference
between those whn were in favour of Union
Governm;ent and those who opposed it was
thle question as to the best ways and means
of carrying on the fight and providing assistance from this Dominion of Canada.
The great question that has been befoee us
ail is the question of the best way to keep
ýup the support of our men at the front, and
at the sanne turne to provide- ail the necessary food and produce that we can for the
benefit of the allied countries that are so
greatly in need of it. This question of ways

10

SENATE

and means is a very difficult one, and one
-hich, as I arn sure the Government realize,
requires a tremendouw a.mount of work in
its solution. 1 arn surai that ail honiourable
gentlemen in this House realize that it is
desirable at the present time to assist the
Government in every possible way in carrying on the business of the country and in
putting for ward every possible effort to attain the object and end that we have in
viewv; and any criticism raised by honourable gentlemen on either side. of this
Chamber will be raised only for the purpose of assisting the Government as far as
possible in the work they have. in hand,
whether it be criticism of their legisiation
or criticism of the particular action that
they have-takeni in the execution of their
work.
In this (hamber we have at the present
time a large addition of members, and 1
arn sure that the new members will realize
that the object of the Senate is to revise,
and perhaps consider more carefully and
deliberately and with that mature judgment and perhaps greater experien-ce which
a large number o! members o! this body
have had in such matters, the legislation
that is introduced by the Government in
either House of Parliament.
For that
reason the criticism offered in this Chamber with regard to proposed legislation
should be more independent aýnd more
deeply considered than possibly it is in
the other House.
Now, I propose to refer for a few minutes
to one or two points in the Speech. Mention bas been made in it of the question of
the Civil Service. An Order in Council bas
been passed dealing witb this matter. I
have only had time to peruse thaît Order in
Counc.ii rather cursorilv, but so far as I
have, been able to study it, the principle
o! the Order in Council does not indicate
any new policy but seems to be on the same
uines as those of the measure which wvas
brought down by the Government of the
time -in 1908, when the Civil Service Act
was amended and a commission was appointed for the purpose of dealing with the
Inside Service. At that time the princIple
of appointment after an examination and
proper consideration. of the candida-tes'
qualifications by the Commission, and th-,
promotion of niembers of the Inside Service for merit aind after further examination, was adopted, and we hoped that that
condition of things would be steadily carried on, whatever Government was in
power. Unfortunately, after the change o!
Hon. Mr. ]BOSTOCK.

Government in 1911, it was not u.pparently
considered satisfactory to administer the
Inside Service in the way that had been
started, and the Act cf 1908 became more
or less a dead letter. The Order in Council
now brought down by the Government, and
which foreshadows further legisiation, extends the principle of the Act of 1908 to
the Outsdde Service and furVher brings in
the question cf the men returned from the
front. 0f course, the necessity of dealing
with men who have returned from the
front is due to the conditions cf the present
time. In 1908 lhere was no problem of the
returned soldier. I .think we all agree that
everything possible should be done to find
positions for returned men, if Vhey are
qualified to perform the duties required,
and we ap>prove of the Order -in Council
which states:
The Prime Minister further recommends that
under the powers conferred by the War Measures Act, 1914, and under ail other powers
vested in your Excellency in Councîl, the following regulation be enacted:
In aIl competitive examinations held under
the Civil Service Amendment Act, 1908, persons
who have been on active service overseas in the
military or naval forces of His Majesty, or any
or the Allies of His Majesty, Who have lef t such
service wlth an honourable record, or who have
been honourably discharged, and Who obtain
sufficient marks to pass such examination. shall,
irrespective of the marks they have obtalned, be
placed In the order of menit on the list of
successful candidates above ail other candidates.

That places tht -returned soldier in a
position ahead o! Vhe ordinary members cf
the Civil Service, and, I think, rigbtly too.
1 am sure that we al agre-e with the
honourable gentleman from the Gul! <Hon.
Mr. L'Espérance) that the relief to meinhers
of Parliament of not having te deal with
the question of patronage will be very great,
and I 'hope that they will ail support the
effort cf the Government to make the Civil
Service a profession which any man in the
country wilI be proud te enter, and which
lie may enter with the feeling that he has
before him a career in wbich he may hope
te serve bhis country, and that when the
time cf life arrives wben be can no longer
perform 'bis duties he will be enabled te
retire with bhonour and credit t-o (himself,
knowing that bis dîfe bas been spent -in
giving- his best services to bis. country when
lie was able.
The other measures that will be brought
before tbe House can be better deait witb
when tbey are submitted; but I want to
draw thie attention of the Government at
tht present time te the question of food
control. It js -one that is. exercising tbe
minds cf the people in ahl parts of tbe

MARCH 19, 1918
country. There has been a considerable
amount of criticism in the West regarding
the Inanner in which the question of food
contrôl 'bas 'been deait wi.th. The people
probably do not realize the difficulties under
which the Governinent axe 1abouiring, particularly those of the transportation problem.
The honourable leader of the Government
will, however, remember that the people
were encouraged last year te increase the
production of foodstuffs. The resuIt 'was
thaît in the province from which I corne a
large quantity of potatos -and other vegetables and farm*products of a perishable nature was .raiised. The evaporator plaLnts on
the coast have been fiJled te their capacity,
and at the preserit moment there are large
supplies of roots and other vegetables i~n
the handes of the farmers, with ne dlemand
for themn. The evaporator plants axe not in
a position Vo make a.ny financial arrangements with the farmers, because they have
reached the lirait of their cred-it, and there
seeras to be ne chance for 1themn to Geli their
products. I have met with mny people who
&&y that the situation offexs ne encouragement te them Vo make a similar effort this
year. That situation may be peculiýar te my
pairticular part cf the country, and I pre.
sume it xnay have been Vo some extent
brought about by the transportation difficulty. -Prohably ne one but a member of
the Gcvernment can know or realiz-e 'what
the transportation, question means at the
present time, or the difficultiesl of .fin<ling
means te send produce Vo the places where
it is required in Europe; but I think thatý
this question ehould be investigated, and
-the farmers should receive instructions, eo
that they maýy know just what is hast for
thern Vo grow during the coming season.
Since aIl grain crops can be saved and
stored very much more eaitisfactorily than
anything in the line of vegetables or roots,
the farmeris, I 'think, should be in-struet-ed
to devote aH their power and attention te
grain crops. The Government can doubtless provide means of etoring grain very
mucli better and more cheaply, should it
be rieeessary te do se, then they coulcI
crops like pot-atoes, which lat only a short
time a'nd are very liable Vo go to waiste.
Similarly with -regard to the campaign
that was carried on in the West fer the
raisin-, cf pigs. We have seen statistics
indicating that there is-in the world. today a shertage of about 35,000,000 pigs., but
if the transportation dilfficulty enters again
into this question, persons who begin now
te Taise a large number cf pigs may find
that when those pigs are ready for the

i

market there will be practically no muarket
for them, because the allîed buyers, whd,
I presume, arrange for the sending forward
cf aIl food supplies, are net in a position
to ship the animais. If men who have
raised a large number cf these animais find
no«means cf disposing cf thema when they
are ready for the market, a great deal cf
trouble will be cauaed. We bad some experience cf it in the West in the early
stages of the war. Conditions arose in
whieh there was enly, apparently, a limited demand for this class cf animal, and.
I have been teld by men engaged. in hograising that they actually went se far as
te shoot the animais because they had. not
enough feed for thern and did net propose
to keep them, net knowing whether they
could find a market later or net. Wheu a
large number cf persons rushi inVo the raising cf hogs, as there is -a danger they may
do, without prcperly censidering the whole
question, the result is bass and disappoint.
ment and disco-ntent throughout the country, and 1 think the Food, Controiber would
be well advised Vo issue instructions which
would be at any rate a guidance te persens engaging in the industry. The Address Tefers to the commercial, industrial -and fluancial stability cf Canada
at the present time. We are ail glad Vo
know tihat the condition cf the country la
se good, ancI I think that the Minister cf
Finance is te -be congratulated on the successful flotation of the Victery Loan which.
he negotiated during the parliamentary recess. That loan was well taken up. The
people of the country came forward and
Subscribed te iV ln a way that shorwed theY vere behi.nd. the -Govemnment
ini that matter, and were anxious te
do al -that they could Vo aeslst in
finding the money required fox carrying on the affairs of the country.
But in dealing with this question the Government is calling, upon the people tu
conserve their wealth and te invest their
money in Govemment boans, and the
Government has undertaken Vo, arrange for
the financing of certain shipbuilding industries in this Dominion. As I understand,
the money required by the Imperial Munitions Board for the carrying on cf the shipbuilding industry is supplied by the Government, and consequently we are responsible
for finding all that mroney at the present
moment. The people naturally ask themselves: if they indiviluslly -are to be careful
and eave ail the money they can, why the
work that is being done by the Munitions
Board should be doue in the extravagant

SENATE

12

way in which it is being done? There is
great criticism of tne action of that board
on the coast at the present time. I think
it is only right to call the attention of the
Government to the matter, so that if they
are not in a position to deal with the Imperial Munitions Board and to represent to
ther that this matter fs not being handled
satisfactorily, they can call upon the Government of Great Britain to take hold of
the matter and deal with it as I think it
should be dealt with; because when the
people are called upon to pay increased
taxation and to save their money for the
purpose -of enabling the Government to get
the financial assistance that is necessary,
they will and do criticise very eeverely any
loose or extravagant method. And, as time
goes on and the Government has to raise
further money throughout the country, they
will find that this question will be brought
before them, and it may have an effect upon
the raising of that money.
In the building of wooden ships there
seems to be no reason why a company
should not go directly to the lumber yard
and get the required material without employing other people to.act as go-betweebs.
It is general knowledge that when you
employ individuals to purchase goods for
you you have to pay commission, whict
raises the cost of the material to the man
who has to use it. That and other points
in connection with this shipbuilding industry certainly require looking into. We want
to see this industry well established in this
country, both on the Atlantic and on the
Pacific. I think we have the recsources and
the materials, and we are getting the men
together and training thein; so that not
only -at the present time, but when the war
is over, the shipbuilding industry will be
on a thoroughly sound and well-established
basis in Canada, and will be a great source
of revenue to the country. At the present
time, under the policy that has been pursued by the Imperial Munitions Board,
certain firms have been handicapped and
could not compete with the board in
building ships because of the way that
money was spent.
The whole country was very much shocked
when it heard the news of the terrible
disaster which to~bk place at Hakfax. The
Speech froim the Throne referred to further
legislation which will be brought down for
the purpose of providing relief for the
people who were injured in that terrible
disaster. The sympathy of the people et
Canada, and of people throughout the world
in general, -went out to the citizens of HaliHon. Mr. BOSTOCK-

fax. Persons who have heen accustomed to
seeing the terrible destruction which is going
on in Europe at the present time on the
fighting front have stated that the destruction and horror of the Halifax disaster were
worse than anything they saw in Flanders.
We shall be only too glad to do anything
to assist in alleviating the distress which
has arisen; and, although I am not aware
that information bas been given out to that
effect, we hope that the conditions have
been thoroughly looked into,. and regulations made, so that no disaster of the kind
cai occur again. When these munition
ships are being moved about and are
calling at certain ports, it is desirable that
every precaution should be taken so that
they cannot come into collision as happened
at Halifax. Every endeavour should be
made to see that no dis-aster of this nature
can occur again, and, further, that, if possible, those responsible for this terrible disaster .should be brought to book. There must
have been some carelessness on the part
of somebody to have caused the collision
which led to the disaster.
I join with my honourable friend froin
Red Deer (Hon. Mr. Michener) in his remarks about immigration. We require
immigrants who are qualified to take up
the work of the country and are prepared to
take their stand as good citizens of Canada.
I fear that, in the past a large number of
people who have come to this country
have not had the proper education and
have not been of the right kind to make
such citizens as we want. I hope that the
minister who bas been appointed to the
portfolio of Immigration-a man who
knows well the requirements of tha country
-- will use every endeavour to sec that in
the future we get the class of immigrants
that will make thoroughly good citizens
and will help us to develop those natural
resources which are going to be the
mainstay of this country in the naar future.
The other matters dealt with in the
Speech from the Throne will be referred-to
later on, and it is not my intention to take
up the time of the Hous- any further,
except to congratulate the Government
upon the businesslike way in which they
have started the work of this session. I
hope this will continue so that we may put
through the work of Parliament as expeditiously as possible, so that the members
may return to the different parts of the
country and do their shar in the work
that awaits them. At (the -present itime
everybody throughout this country bas so
much to do, and is so vitally interested in

MARCH 19, 1918

seaing that our production is made as
great as possible, thaît we do flot want to
spend time unnecessarily in Ottawa, and
we should be only too anxious to get
through our business as quickly as possibld.

-

Hon, sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, *mnay J be permitted, in
the first place, to thank my honourable
friend the leader of the opposite &ade cd
the House ('Hon. Mr. Bostock) for the
personal references which he has made to
inyseif in connaction wîth the new depart.
ment of Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment,
which is now in course of organization.
My honourable friend spoke in most
complimentary terms, which I appreciate
very much. Only my modesty prevents
me from properly answering his remarks
concerning my handling of the publie
business. I did expect my honourable
-friend to speak somewhat consolingly -and
sympaithetically in regard to my having
assumed new responsibilities; but, instead
of that, hie spoke cheerfully and felicitatingly upon the additional burdens which
have beean placed upon my shoulders. Soine
time ago I arrogated to myseîf the credit
of doing the work of a grown mani in
Ottawa, parficularly since war broke outand 1 was therefore rather surprised wheri
the Prima Minister intimated to me that
he thought I should itake further burdens
and cultivate new :fields of responsibility.
Notwithstan'dinga that, I find my honourable
friend, whom I always regardéd as being
sympaithetic towards me, flot sympathizing
with me, but rather complimenting- me
upon having assumed those responsibiliiies.
I join with my honourable friend the
leader of the Opposition in extending my
cong-ratulations to the mover and seconder
of the reply t-o 'the Speech from the Throne.
I desire to congratulate thern upon their recent entry into this Chamber and on the
able and satisfac'tory niner in whieh they
have discharged the duty assigned to thein
in moving and seconding the resolution nowv
before the House. Thev thus -ive evidenice
of the value they will be in the deliberations
of this Cham-ber, a £'hamber which will furnisli theni a fiekd for public service that I
.am satisfied will be gratifying to themselves.
I was very muoch pleased at the felicitous
rem.arks made by my honourable iriend
Irorm the Gufi (Hon. '-Nr.,L'Espéramece), 'who
mo'ved thse reply to the Speech from thse
'Throne.
Touching the question of using
both languages in itbis Chamber and the
liope hie expressed that il time we should

ail bie expert in lx>th tongues, he oert.ainly
had thse advantage of the Englisis membere
in the remarks 'which he so aptly made. I
at once made overtures to my honourable
friend from Stadacona (Ho.u. Mr. Landry),
who sits beside *me, and who. is one of thse
most aidvanoed -and -militant exponents of
the dual language, that if hie woul undertake to procure mie a speaking knowledge, of
the French lainguage 1 would he very pleased
to use it. Having made these ove.rtures, I
trust my honourable friend will not reproach
me further, and will consider that the responsibilitv is his to see that I acquiee such
knowledge as wiil permit me to meet bis
expectation a.
Before thse prorogation of thse last session
of Parliament took place, tise Prime '.Ninister had .pub]icdly declared that there would
be an early raorganizaition of the Govern.
ment, and thaît, in view of the serions conditions with which wve had to deal concernin- tise war, a reorganization, in deference
to both public sentiment and nutional requirement, would be carried out upon a
union basis in which thse two great political
parties in Canada would be equally re'presented. This promise has been .practically
fulfilled. It la zegrettable that the first proposais of thse Prýime Minister made to the
leader of the Opposition, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, were flot accepted by thse leader of the
Liberal parti-, for reasons -%vliehl lie specifically stat-ed, but which I thjnk 4 mig-ht he
said did flot appeal to the people of Canada.
It therefore became desirable that those
negotiations should he carried on through
other channels within tise Liberal party.
These latter efforts were prc.ductive cf satisfactory results. and it would he diffIcL:t te
controvert the assertion that the reorgariized
Government is representative cf the Vwo.
great parties in Canada.
Upon this, reorganization having taken
place, Parliament w.as dissolved. Thse people
cf Canada were asked te express their confidence in the Government so reorganized,
with the reszult that it was -sustained and
given a support which is represented in the
Parliament of to-day, and which in numerica: êtrength has exceeded the most sanguine expectationse. It may therefore bie said
with confidence that the Government has
an overwhelnîingly-expressed declaration by
tîse -people cf Canada te pursue the poli-cy
which hias been adopted since the war
began, and which will be continued until
thé Allies bring this war to a -successful
conclusion.

Nor'th America may be said to be the

deeper and wider and more permanently on
this continent than elsewbere within the
boundaries of civilization. We in Canada
and our ally the United States have a peculiar Tesponsibility'devolving upon us i
thia war. Both peoples have not only been
called upon Vo furnish their quota of flghtîng men, and thus Vo hold their own in the
fighting line, but, owing Vo the marvellous
resources of both countries in the furnisbing
of food supplies a.nd munitione, Canada and
the United States are playing a peculîs.r and
exceptional part in this the greatest struggle of the centuries.
Had our interestis in Canada not been tied

As indicated in the Speech from the
Throne, the Government is committed to

Act, -but by special kegislation already indicated lu the -speech from -the Tbrone, the

What did we see at the la.st election?
Polis were held in the United States, from
the Atlantic to the Pacifie, to take the votes
of those men who- knew nothing of -Canada,
mnen who, did not know the names of the
electoral divisions, much less the names of
the candidates. Polls were held in very
many places in the United States, and
electors voted there to determine the fate
and policy of Canada lor the next four or
five years. I said that these men would
have to be coached and that ýtheir ballots
would go te the doubtful counties. I nover
expected that that would be but- a
hundredth part of the truth. The military
of Canada, here and in Europe, were en.tit.led to state their preference as to the
county to which their vote would go, if they
could nlot remeimber the place in Canada
where they had been for a turne, or if they
had neot beon four months residont in this
country prior te their enlistment. Here
are the questions that were5 put te thern
by the Military Voters' Act:
6. Specify the naines of the place or places
in Canada (givlng streets and numbers, where
possible) whereat you last contlnuously resided
during at least four inonths of the twelve months
lmmedlately preceding your appointment, enlistmnent, enrolment or calllng out on active
service.
7. State If you can the electoral district
wherein such place or places in which you so
resided are situate.
8. If you cannot specify as required by question No. 6, or state as required by question No.
7, then state in what electoral district or place
within Canada you have resided ai any other
time than is referrecr to in question No. 6.
9. If none of your answvers to questions Nos.
6. 7 and 8 specify or state as required thereby.
10 what eiectoral district do you desire your vote
to be applied?

This question was put to all the soldiers
on the othor side and te those in camp in
Canada. This Act, needlefs te say, opened
the door te fraud. The Canadian soldiers
were invited, 'honourable gentlemen, to
switch their votes .from the county in
which they had resided te a county wherein their vote would be effective. In the
very heart of the -province of Quebec, within
striking di§tance of the city of Montreal,
in broad day-light, in the presence of repreeentatives oi both parties, eig-ht hundred
votes were switched into one county where
they could be more effective. I have seen

which I have read te you were printed in
a small weekly, publi.shod for the soldiers
in barrac¶ks, and an answer was auggeated te
enable them te switch their ballots to a
county near Montreal. They were teld:

He has stated that if Canada had been a

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Certain]y. We
would have waited, like the Un.ited States
and some of the South American republies,
until a casus belli special to Canada, affecting its material interests or its honour, h-ad
occurred. 0f course, the people of Canada,
like the rest of hurnanity, had an inteTest
in defending justice and liberty in the
wvorld, but that interest was insufficient to
impel the United States and ail the South
Arnerican republies to enter the war. It
was insufficient, and ail the more honour
to Can-ada that she did go to war, not for
self-interest, but from sentiment alone. The
Anglo-Canadian did join in, bjecause of his

There are things with which I arn in hearty

consideration of the Asidresa ln reply to

irfterest in Canada, to the detriment of genuine and true electors of the country. I
wish also to speak of the unjust accusations
which were hurled at the province of Quebuc during the election in order to excite
against that province the prejudices of the
other provinces; but I have decided to postpone my remarks on those subjects until a
later date, and until such time as I have
obtained the information which I am asking for by the motions which are to be made
to-morrow.
Hon. N. A. BELCOURT: Honourable
gentlemen, I had not intended taking any
part in the debate upon the Address, and it
was not until my honourable friend who
leads this House with so much ability gave
us his interesting and very eloquent speech
yesterday that I ielt a desire or inspiration
to say anything. My object is purely and
simply to point out -what seems to me to be
at the present moment the supreme and
paramount duty of Canada and of every one
in Canada.
First of all, may I join -with those who
'have preceded me in extending hearty congratulations to the mover and the seconder
of the Address. There was little, if anything at all, which the gentlemen said to
which every member of this House couild
not with a clear conscience subscribe. I
was particularly interested, if I may be permitted to say so, in the speech delivered by
my honourable friend from the Gulf division (Hon. Mr. L'Espérance). I was inpressed wvith the facility and the felicity
with which he expressed his thoughts in
the French language. I am told that *my
honourable friend has devoted practically
all of his life to commercial pursuits, and
that he has not had an opportunity of perfecting his proficiency in that very difficult
and always susceptible of improvement
language, the French language. It is all
the more credit to him that he was enabled
on this occasion, in moving the Address,
which is always a more or less perilous
task, to make a speech in French which
would be worthy of any French audience
anywhere in the world. While he was
speaking, I could not help reflecting
how unfair and unjust isthe accusation so
frequently made against the French that
is spoken in Canada-that we speak patois
in the province of Quebec. Well, if my
honourable friend's French is patois, it is
patois that is thoroughly understood and
appreciated in France, and would adorn
even la Chambre des Députés.
Hon. Mr. DAVID.

The honourable gentîlenmn was followed
by the ahonourable member from Red Deer
(Hon. Mr. Michener), and he also rmade a
very finished speech. I wias impressed with
the dealaration which he made with regard
to the use of the French language. Ilut I
wonder if iny honourable friend from Red
Deer considered for one moment how he is
going to carry out his very laudable intention of seeing that his sons are not handicapped in the manner with which he tolds
us he suffers, for itwas only the other day
that in the province from which my honourable friend comes, and in the province
which adjoins it, the trustees of all the
schools solemnly passed a resolution to
banish forever the French language from
the schools of those two provinces. If ny
honourable friend is going to carry out his
laudable intention, he will have to send his
othersons to Quebec or Montreal;
wisée I am very much afraid that his sons
will be handicapped in the way in which
he fears.
t
My onourable friend · he leader of the
Governiment (Hon. Si.r Janes Lougheed)
feait also that it w-as hie d.uty to say something about the use of the French language,
and when he started I was hoping that he
would not content himself merely with the
pious wish to which he gave expression.
After saying something which was not very
clear or very definite-at all events not very
compromising-with regard to the French
language, ?he turned to the gentlemuan who
has the honour and responsibility of sitting very close to him (Hon. Mr. Landry)
and told him that it was his duty to see
that my hanourable friend's past deficiency
should be removed in the future. I should
have thought that my honourable friend
would not have been content to say
so little to the point with regard to the
use of the French language.
I want also to congratulate my honourable friend thorougiy' and sincerely-and
not comimiserate wi-th him at alb-upon the

him. The evidence w-hich he has given in
the House and to the country, of -ability ta
do a tremendous amount of work and
do it efficiently, was indeed ample justification for the additional burden -imposed
upon him. I desire also to congratulate
my honourable friend wiho sits next to him
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) upon the tact that
be has been caliled to penform additional
and very responsible diuties in connection
with the administration of public affairs.
The Senate also is to be congratulated upon
the fact that.new duties have been assigned
to my honourable friends. It is a recogni-

to my mind, the supreme and paramount

I was much struck-and that is really the duty of the present hour in Canada.

Militarism ail over the wor]d. Net only

our sparsely populated country, with its
tremendous geographical and other difficulties, how are we going te make this country

Great Britain waited a few days; but Great

for the reasons which I have indicated-the

because the United States, perhaps t.he
greatest exemplar of deanocracy in the
wor]d, had a paramount duty to perforrn in
standing up for dernocratic princîples and
dernocratie ideals.
Honourable gentlemen have to-Id us that
the war is and m ust continue to be the
supreme concern of the moment. I agree
with that; but I disagree when they tell us
that is the only thing and that evejy-thing
else must be put to one side and flot considered. 1 submit that it would be rank tolly
for us to neglect ail other things sirn.y
because we have this great difficulty and
burden on our hands. While sorne tlus
that the war is the whoie and only thing,
the Government of the day very wisely
has mot aeted on that principle. If they
had done so they would be seriously blarned.
They have discussed immigration, returned
soldiers, trade after the war and rnany other
urgent probiems; tbey even took the opportunityof passing that outrageons deal with
the Canadian Northern. The fact that the
war -was on did not prevent honourable gentlemen putting through Parliament the
deal, or the steal-I have no hesitation ini
calling it that-ýwhich was carried with the
Canadian Northern Bill; and of course we
have not heard the last of it. When the

and with persistent regularity, when the
results of the rather f.arcicai investigation

cencern, corne along, and the bill with it,
and the other bis that this country has to

about the Ganadian «Northern deal.
Besides these material problems, 've have
national and social probierns, and we canneît afford te neglect them because of this
other great and pressing war probiern. We
have te look after the seul cf Canada. We
cannet negleet the body spiritual. If the
members cf the Ujnion Guverntnent, will
only think for one momnent cf the horrible
condition cf the seul cf Canada at the present ýtime, if tbey will only diagnose our
tremenydous racial trouble, they wihl find
perhaps that their supreme and paramount

Allies, is it net an essential. prelirninary
condition that yen should flrst cf a-Il create

and establish Canadian harmony and unity?
I agree with my honourable friend that the
setting up of one section of the community
te upbraid another, te keep up these
racial differences, is stupid and useless, besides being most detrimental. What are the
facts? The French Canadians constitute
one-third of the population of Canada, and
they are here to stay. Are you going to ate sea? Are you
tempt to drive them into
going to prevent them from multiplyingfrom putting into effect the Biblical
admonition? Are you going te prefer the
tiffraff of Europe to the people who have
been here for three hundred years?
Only the other day, in the House where
the affaira of this province are administered, one minister-the one primarily responsible for all the trouble in this province,bracketed the French Canadian with the
Austrian and the German, making them all
one deserving of equal treatment-or rather
giving no better treatment to one than to the
others. Is that the way to bring about
unity and darmony in this country?
Some honourable gentlemen in this country-and it has .been the subject of many
oommenta in the press--are worrying because 'the French Canadians have no representative to-day in the Union Governnent.
Nobody need worry over that. The French
Canadians are net worried in the least. They
are not anxious to have any representation
in this Government. If the Government of
the day is willing te treat them, not as
pariahs, but as equals, they will join the
Government to-morrow in administering the
affairs of this country. What is the fact? The
irritation is so great, se universal, that the
Union Government has net been able te
find a single French Canadian in either
party willing to accept a seat in the Government. Is not that sufficient to make everybody pause? Is not that sufficient to cause
everyone te look anxiously at the situation,
and, as I said before, to thoroughly diagnose
and try to understand and solve this
scandalous difficulty.
I am not saying these things to be disagreeable. I am eaying them because I
believe I am a true and patiotic Canadian. I
believe that Canada is destined to be a
great country, but I afso believe that it cannot be a great country unless we have that
harmony and unity which is absolutely es-sential to 'greatness. It xnay ibe an exaggeration to say that conditions here teday are so bad that they are net far remo.ved from the conditions which have prevailed in Ireland for centuries past; but
Ido not think we are far from it. But hon-ourabile gentlemen-are not wi.lling te disten

27

to the warnings so frequently given. God
knows they have been frequent enough, loud
enough, but nobody seems to care. The people responsible have simply cast thern to
one side with a gesture of impatience or
impotence; they have paid no attention to
them; with the result that the gangrene bas
gone on increasing, and bas got deeper into
the body politic; and unless some operation
is performed at once the whole body will
be carried away.
I regret that I have itaken so much time;
but I must repeat that to me, however great,
however supreme is our duty with regard
to the war, the duty of creating and establishing national unity permanently in Canada is greater and more pressing, because
unity in Canada is the basis on which unity
of effort in the war aibsolutely depends. If
you are going to have unity of effort
you must have national unity in Canada. It
is essential not only for Canada but for the
Empire. People to-day are agitated with the
idea of binding the British Empire closer
together. tIow can that be brought about?
How can you ihope for any measure of
closer union when you have such conditions in Canada as I describe? Outside
of Great Britain, Canada is the most
important part of the British Empire,
and the Lime is probably not far
distant when it will be the greatest part.
In all conscience, in all seriousness, let
us apply ourselves to the solving of this
difficulty. I hope I am not exaggerating,
but I have been deeply impressed for many
years with the urgent necessity of something
being done, and done at once. I venture to
say that to-morrow, if the provinces which
have taken these measures for the pr )e6ption of the French language would cease
their persecution, there would be peace in
Canada; you could have peace in Quebec;
you could remove this terrible sore. I
appeal te my honourable friends from that
province-to say if that is not the whole
question. The French Canadian is-determined to speak his own language; he is
determined to have his own language
taught te and spoken by his children; and
why should he not, when ihe hears honourable - gentlemen like my honourable
friend from Red Deer (Hon. [Mr. Michener)
eay that his son is net te be handicapped
by the want of knowledge of that. language?
Let the question of French in the schools be
settled, and I promise you that you will
have peace in Canada.
With regard te the Union Government, I
am not going to criticise it more than is
necessary. I am net going to do anything te
prevent it carrying on its war policy. Se

It will take time te stamp out that ignorance.
On the contrary, where in the province of

London Advertiser: they had all been

tallywhack for making this st-atement, but
there Is ne doubt about it. They did net

of the Iast Parliament, denouncing measures
which they are now helping Sir Robert

heard them with my own cars. Five
minutes before the Governor General came
te this Chamber, the present Acting Minister of Finance was hurling thunder at the
Government ranks with regard to their
Military Voters Act, and to-day he is helpinga te administer that Act. The thing is
simply absurd.
Passing te a personal matter, Vo which
allusion bas already been made, 1 wish te
change the course of the compliments and

responsible ministers..
The bonourable

dignity of this lieuse. I know that my

these two a.cquisitions, and I feel certain
that the honourable gentlemen will performi
their duties in the best intereets of this

If it would net shake the modesty of the
honourable leader of the Gevernment, I
would express the wish that ail the ministers of the present Union Government
were as devoted te the public service and as
honest, as hie la. I use the word honest
advisedly. The results of the last elections
show how dishonest some of themn were.
But I am net going te discuss that phase ef
the question, and I -am net now ýattacking

just as bad as, if net worse than, some of

When I protested, it was net te prevent
bena fide wives having a vote; but giving
it te the grandmother, the sister, the daughter, andi all the relations, with ne control

a fair Iaw, and yet the honourable the leader of the Government took credit te the
Governinent for having an immense inajority of the votes in the country. They
have a anajority of such votes as were
polled; but, the 745,000 votes cast for the
Liberal party were the honest votes of
bonest men, votes cast in spite of 'hilîs
whieh had te be climbed, in the shape of
etubborineas on the part of the returning
officers and others. As etated by the honoura>.e nember for De Lorihiier (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand), if the wamen'e vote 'were taken
f rom the total, we on this si-de of the Hoiise
weuld be in the majority. What was the
resuilt Of the election enyhow? On the nighit
of the election Sir Wilfrid Laurier had
ninety-two members behind. hlm, with a
prospect of four more, especislly in. Halifax, where he wc>uld have had two seats;
but owing to the unfortunate occurrence
there, they went Union. On the day after
tbe election Sir Robert Borden said: "'It is
true that my inajority is only forty-five, but
wait a few weeks and it will be raised to
sixty." How did be k-now? He counted on
the soldiers' vote. He said so. He knew
bow the soldiers would vote before they
voted,. and his prediction hks corne true.
Wihat is the result to-day? SiT Wilfrid Laurier, instead of havîng ninety-four meanbers
behind hum, has only eighty-two; and the
Union Governinent did everything in its
power to knock out the few -men who would
have been good critics, sucb as the Hon.
Frank Oliver, the men froin Prince Edward
Island, and th.ree or four froin Nova ScotiaThat is not Union Government. We bave
flot got Union Governinent in this Senate.
The Governinent bas been .replacing old
Liber&] senators with good, young-, staunch.
Conservatives. They bave flot taken the
leader of the Opposition into their counsels. There is absolutely no union. The
Governinent uses this House for it.s party
ends, and treats it in just the same way
as in the old days, the same as Sir Wilfrid
and Sir John Macdonald and other prime
ministers in the past used te do. There is
no union. The leader of thie Governinent
will understand 'what I inean. If be had
one or two members froin this side of the
Houise in bis counsele it would make things
much easier; but no. And we -are net going
te take it now any -more than Sir Wilfrid
Laurier accepted the offer from Sir Robert
Borden at the heel cf the hunt, when the
hare was killed. The offer was made. Why.
yes; but it was made after the plate was
einpty-the nieat was taken, and even the
bones were gone. That was not an offer

of union. Ail this goes to show that the
Government need not arrogate to it-seif supreme power-need not and should not. It
ought to be ashamed.
As -far as the measures proposed in the
Speech from the Throne are conceriied, 1

Dominion. I throw out these suggestions
because I think they may have some effect
with the Union Government.
I have not criticised the different measures of the Government, but I could not
pass over the unequal and unfair way in
I
which the last election wes carried.
could not pass without criticising the manner in which the election was conducted,
and corroborating the charges made by the
honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Belcourt). I can assure you, honourable
gentlemen, that the province of Quebec
has more dairness to the square inch 'with
regard to race and rel-igious miatters than
the province of Ontario has to the square
mile; and, from the look of things, I am
afraid it has more fairness to the square
inch thon there is to the square acre in the
West. There ie nothing ibut fairness in
every transaction of the French people with
their English fellow-citizens. They give
t'hem everything possible in the shape of
educaition. They give them al kinds of
protection. They have no eay, and do not
want any say, as to the English schoolis.
Where 'there are only one or two English
famildes in a French village the people
nominate a member cf one of thoee families
for nayor. Why, in the French town of
Hawkesbury I was made mi-ayor after two
or three years' residence. There is not a
dfairer people on the face of the earth. Why
these blessed editors and pulpiteers and
lodige-runners do not open their eyes and
acknowledge the fact is more than I can
underetand. Why_ do they not leave the
French people alone? I fail 1to apprehend
the motives of these people in regard to
the province of Quebec.
I am just going to touch on the patriotism
of the French Canadians. They -are ten
times more patriotic than the Flavelles, the
Allisons, and many of the Conservatives
who are locked arm-in-arm with the antipatrãotie element of Quebec. There is more
patriotism in the province of Quebec than
in any other province of the Dominion of
Canada. The French Canadians are for
Canada first, last, -and all the time. They
rare not against England; they are not
againet France; but they want to look after
their own interests first, last, and all the
time, and who ie going to call them traitors
for that? They did not refuse to go to the
front out of pure deviltry. They are in
arme to-day on account of the treatment
meted out to them by certain elements in
Ontario and the West, and I as a representative of Quebec endorse their attitude,
and will iback them; and let the EnglishHon. Mr. CLORAN.

speaking element of Canada understand
that I am not alnneinthat attitude. I stand
here for the French Canadians in all their
demande, because their demands are justified; they are based on right; they are based
on liberty. and justice for all, and not for
the few; and the editors and pulpiteers
and platform orators of Canada will have
disappeared when the province of Quebec
will still be on the banks of the St. Lawrence. The French Canadians were here
before them, and they will be here after
these loudimouthed Flavelles, profiteers,
and others have gone. They are here to
stay. They are the key of the North
American continent. Some peaeple seem to
forget that. Why do they not open their
eyes to this fact? R am not a French Canadian, but my eyes have been opened to the
fact. I know who and what the Freneh Canadians are; I know what they mean and what
they want; and the sooner the members of our
Government from the top down--some of
whom, including the President of the Privy
Council, denounced the French Canadian
people and their religion during the last
campaign-recognize that fact, the soner

Hon. JAMES DOMVILLE: Honourable
gentlemen, I would like to say a few words
during this fracas. I had _no intention of
epeaking, because I stand on the apex of a
pyramid. 'It is like standing on a monument
in London w4ith the people all scrambling
around, and you cannot tell what they are
doing. In the province of New Brunswick
we never rebelled. We can trace our ancestry right back, navy and army, _to the
'battle of Agincourt, haok to William the
Conqueror, or .to the time when we were
all French. We have perhaps differed and
branched off since then, but it is the same
stock that is going into this fight.
The admirable speeches made on all sides,
especially that of the honourable leader of
the Government, commended themselves to
me, and now I am speaking from my heart,
because I am the oldest menber of either
the Senate or the Commons in date of appointment. I was in the Commons in 1872,

I speak for my own denomination. Do you
think that 1 would subseribe for one moment to apostolic succession? Moses was a

He 'was a strong mnan. To-day wo lack

she should caîl on us, and hiow far we
should contrihute; but there is nu reason
why we should have things cramimed doýwn
our throats a.nd the wool pulled over our
eyes. We will support good measures. The
trouble has heen relieved for the moment
by this coalition, but what does it amount
to? Like the honourable gentleman froin
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcouit), I would have
given every support to the Government,
but now I say, keep it for your own seamews, keep iV for your own crows. Il they

go around in gaiters and who are drawing
immense srums of money. I read in the
paper the other day of one oelebrated divine
who gave -away twentyfive million sterling. Where did te get it? Was he a disciple of the Galilean Fisherman, who walked
about in bare feet and spread the gospei?
I say that the amaesing of such wealth has
absolutely perverted the gospel. The true
spirit and intention of saving the race, of
endeavouring to make it Christian, is gone.
Oh-niatianity bas dàsappeared.
Coming down to the divine right of kings,
I am against that too. I am loyal to the
King:' the King is doing all he can; but
hereafter the people must say who is going
to rule them. The naine of the Royal Family
has now -been changed to that of -the -House
of Windsor. They had to do it, and we are
on the eve of a struggle all over the world
between the smaller and the larger man.
I do not know who Flavelle is. I have
seen his naine in the papers. He has millions of money. There are more millionaires
in Canada today than ever before. How
did they get their money? Where did it
come from? Who has suffered? Where was
their patriotism when they would accept all
that? The women down our way have been
working with their fingers from early morning till late at night making socks and all
sorts of things to send to the troops, and
here are these magnates flaunting their
wealth before the country. Yet there is
considered to be no vice in that. I do not
want to throw any slurs at anybody, but I
say the whole principle is wrong.
As I said long ago, it was not my duty to
find fault or cri.ticise the Government, or tto
vote against them until the proper time
came; but when they did wrong, then I had
the rigi to criticise and find fault. The
Liberal party has contributed something
towards the welfare of this country; but I
should rather have seen the Conservatives
continue in their magnificence-the magnificence of their power, the magnificence of
their elections. I could tell you something
about elections, too, if I wanted to do so,
for I have seen how they are conducted.
Sir John Macdonald, before he went down
to defeat in 1874, had a majority of 34. I
was with him then and had the honour of
supporting him, but if I were asked to-day
if I would belong to this party, I must
reply that I could not. Why? I cannot
change aIl the time, and I would vote
against this party because I must be faithful
to my duty. When Sir John Macdonald
went down to defeat in 1874, what was his
answer to me? This, perhaps, may be a
state secret, but it is well that it should be
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE.

known. He said: "We cannot get along.
We have been long enough in power, and
we must give place to the Liberals; but they
winl not stay long, and we shall become
stronger than we were before."
As to the Pacifie scandal, there was
absolutely nothing in it, although because
of it and because of his honour and his
appreciation of public opinion Sir John
Macdonald went out of power. There
were two companies concerned. Macpherson
had one and Sir Hugh Al-Ian had the other.
In order that there miglht be no trouble, Sir
John Maîodonald offered two dfhfarters, and
whidhever one could fulfil the conditions
and build the Canadian Pacifie railway was
to 'te granted tihe charter. What did Sir
Hugh AU-an do? He contributed $200,000
out of his own pocket-not out of the country's treasury, but out oa his own pocket.
He filsdhed nothing from the treasury. Good
ol Scotchman as .he as, he tock nothing
for himsef. He Vhouht that it was hàs duty
to assist in getting that railway built for
the development of the country. My honouraible friend (Hon. Mr. Bostock) referred
in (his speech to the importance cf Vise
transportation problem, the probilem of
bringing ood products out of the country.
Sir John Maicdonald said that what Sir
Hugh Allan did was a leap in the dark.
Wedl, Macdonald felt so keenly ihis aeceptance of the $200,000 for election purposes
that he vent down. 'Dhere was a man whom
I woudid fo'low to-norrow to Hades if necessary.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: A little later on.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE: I an afraid I shall
not have the honour of meeting some of you
there, because I hniak the devil has reserved
me a !better p-ace.
As to the present situation, we must rise
superior to it. It shows how far the people
can be led fby erroneous ideas and sentiments. The women carried this election.
Farniaies were divided over · he issue, -and
t
there was more animosity amongst the
women in my district than would be
imagined possible. It is difficult to say what
the resudt would have been if all the women
in Canada had been given the vote, which,
I think, would have been fairer. I was always opposed to granting the vote to women.
Ilf I were asked about it to-day, personally,
I would not favour it, because it might result in tie destruction cf the Empire, judging 1y -the rows and wrangling and the false
impressions given to the women Iby tihis,
that, and -the other -preacher. That vote
could never 'be utilized in a co-mmon-sense
way. Perhaps what we are saying will go

MARCH 20, 1918
over to England. 1 do flot know whether it
willbe jy1bl'ished in Cana-da or not. Nobody
ever reads what dis said in the Senate, and
nobody rares, 'hut the Sen-ate should make a
Ianclnark to-day. We Ghoudd accep-t -what
my honourable friend says-that' they will
do tihe!ir duity. He piedges -hiimadf-and bis
word is good-thatwe wi-1 flot -stand for any
wrongdoing. 1 will flot use a stronger word
than wrongdoing, or falling from grace.
WVitlh that uxnderstanding, it is our diuty to
support 4/he Governinent, but it is their duty
to lop off aIl the rotten branches that are
around bLhem. When. there is in the Government someone who is useful, we will keep
hlfm; when qhe ia flot uisefua, we wil1i fire
hlm. I know that Rny honourable friend
(Hon. Sir James Lougheed>, 'whoan we
aliways -look upon as la co'ming Prime Minister of Canada-I think he will be yetwill stand by what is right, and I have full
confidence in him. But let it not be supposed that intelligent men, who have sailed
the oeean main and climbed the mountains
to the Pacifie, will tolerate any tinsel or
sasi, or wild retain a mnen simply because
he is a supporter of the Government and
it is expedient to take him in on account
of his antecedents or his present condition.
I heard sonfne one aay that ihis was the
strongest Government that ever existed since
Coniederation and also the weakest; it i?
the strongest in votes, but it has flot the
confidence of the people.
Now, let us see what will corne of ail this
as the year goes on. In the near future
we shail have an enormous amount of
liabilities to face. That is what is going to
hit tbe people-take the money ouf of their
pocketq and bloed them. No matter what
s3phistry or pleading is used. the question*
will be asked: " Where did this money go?
Could if have been saved? Could any of it
have been saved?" No one imagined when
we went into this war that it would cost
us $2,000,000,o0o, but before we are through
with it it will have cost more than $2,000,(,9,000 and we cannot evade our liability.
It is our duty to do whatever may be necessary. 1 feit from the very first, and I feel
tu-day, that it would be impossible to contribute the 500,000 men promised in our gush
of patriotismn and our desire to elevate ourselvef, before the English and other peoples
of th-, world. Anybody who has read history -- understands milîtary affairs can sec
r
that this country could not make good itr

I desire now te pay a compliment to Sir
Sam Hughes. He does flot like me and I
do flot like him; but, while he made mistakes and blunders, he succeeded in bxingiiîg an army together more quickly than any
other man in Canada could have done. 0f
(-ourse, 1Ido flot want to find any fault with
the generals we have about us. It is very
pleasant to be called a geperal, althoughi
pergonally I wouid hate to be called anyth:ing but citizen Domivîle-citoyen. I'have
too flxm a belief in demo-cracy and in the
people to think that J should 'he in any way

When you go home, ail of you, think if

of the Government.
Whcn you go back

"How are matters going? Have you done
ruch and such a thingP" "Yes." ";But
have we nothing to say about it?" "No;
if is the soldiers' vote; you have nothing f0
say." The women will run this country.
The w~omen will run us. Now, I tbink it is
ail very well in a certain respect for the
women to mun us, but it is not good for the
state.
It ds not good, for the Governmnent to flout
the people or to flaunt before them the idea.
that t.hey can carry on the affairs of this
couintry as they please. They cannot do
w'hat they like. They will not be allowed
to do what they like, no inatter how good
their intentions may be. How many memnbers of the present Cabinet will be left in

MARCU 21, 1918
-Sonie few weeks ago we were shocked to
learn of the sudden death of our late colleague, Senator Gillmor. He was with us
at the prorogation of the last session and
from his appearance and the numbar of his
years we thought he had .many years of life
before him. Senator Gilimor did flot oflen
speak in this Chamber, yet ha was a man
of great business experience, whose knowledge and judgment were most highly
valuad in the dalibarations and business of
the Senate. His was a disposition and
temperament peculiarly attractive, and s0
appaaled to ail of us that we were glad of
his presence and his friendship. Ris death
was sudden and unexpected, and he leaves
behind him a family who will greatly mourn
his loss. We join with them in the
bereavement they have suffered.
Thus we realize what shadows we are,
how short our days, and how unsubstantial
the things we pursue. We mourn the death
of our three colleagues, and we extend our
sympathies to their faniiies who thumourn the loss whîch thay and we alike
have suffered.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honourable
gentlemen, I do -not know that there is very
much that I can add to what 'nas been so
well said by the honourabla the leader of
the Government in refaranoe to our late colleagues. From bis exparience in another
plaoe before he came hara, the late Senator
Sproule proved himself to ha a vers'
valuable member of tbis Housa. WVhen he
came here he at once took bis position, both
in the House and in the coinmittees, as a
nian who thoroughly grasped the work
came before us. H1e had had
which
experience in the ganaral business of the
country in his own locality, and that
exparience wvas always of great value in
connection with any questions that arose.
Sir Mackenzie Bowell we ail knew and
adxnired vary much. His life is bound up
with the hist.ory of this Dominion. In 1867
he was elactad to the Parliament of Canada
for the first time. and sat continuously as
a member of the Housýe of Gommons until
he was appointed to the Senate. H1e was
aLways a strong fighter; he was always
ready and willirig for a scrap, and always
enjoyad it; at the sama time, ha neyer mnade
enemies of those whomn he was oipposin,
because his fighting was always dlean and
above board. In his early if e ha was ver,
active in-the volunteer movement, and later
in the militia movemant. Probably that
was one of the reasons why ha developed
tbis keenness for a fig-ht. H1e held positions
in the Government o! the country for 25

39

yaars, and, notwithstanding the amount of
work that he did, he wvas active and
anergetic to the very last. One incident
that struck me as most extraordinary was
that a man of his age could make up his
mind to travel to the extrema western end
of this Dominion, as ha did when he was 92.
He said that he had neyer sean that part
of the country, and that il was the duty of
a publie man to know tThe country for which
ha was legislating. A journey o! that ki.nd
for a man o! bis age was, 1 think, an
axtraordinary thing. We on this sida of the
House most sincerely regret that be has
passed from us, and we sympathiza most
sincerely wvith his fa.mily.
Our friend Sanator Gilimor was not very
conspicuous in the work o! the Housa, or on
the committees, but ha was always on hand
to do bis part. His was a most lovabla
nature, and ail thosa who knew him were
excaedingly fond of him. Ha was very
strong in bis ideas on ail questions of trada,
and was a prominant business man in the
Maritime Provinces. We ware shocked by
bis sudden death, as he departed at a comparatively early age for members of this
House. certainly very early compared with
the age that had been attained by Sir Mackenzia Bowell. We extand to bis widow and
family our sincere sympathy in the lass
they h.ava sustained.
Hon. PHILIPPE JLANDRY (translation):
Honourabla gentlemen, thie veterans of
our political world are passing away. In
thinking of the Senators w'honî death has
struck down since the last Session, and -%vlh
have forever disappeared froim this enclosure, we the living o! to-day-those o! us at
least who ara privileged by a.ge or long service to approach more nearly to the tombs
wvhich have just closed-are called upon,
standing besida the open grave, and casting
therain a handful of earth. to bid a last
farewell ho our foreuunners, and to transmit
to those who follow us the tender maemory
o! the virtuas whicbi we admire in those
whose loss we ffnourn.
In the public life o! the men whose eulogies we have jush heard there have been
incidents which. cannot ha forgotten. Welline up in our hearts are sentiments of
gýratitude the k-nowledge of which il bahooves us to carry forward ho the genaration which is gradually replacing that to

It wouid ha a strange failure on .my part
to recognize the full druty imposed upon me

Chamber if, in the name of the province of

SENATE
which 1 arn one of the representatives, I
did not pay to the rneinory of Sir Maekenzie Bowell a tribute of gratitude frorn
mny co-religionists for the firrn attitude
manifested by him as the Canadian Prime
Minister in the memorable crisis which a!rnost engulfed his Government in the derk
days of January, 1896.
I lived those thrilling days. I ivas a witness, in J.uly, 1895, otf the resounding resignations of 'Messrs. Angers, Caron and Ouimet, of the return of the last two to the
ministry, and of the splendid isolation of
Mr. Angers, who persisted in his deterinination to remain outside of a .ministry which
tenporized instead of adopting for our
brothers in 'Manitoba the measures of justice indicated to us by the Constitution
legally interpreted by a judgment of the
Privy Council. The attitude taken by the
province of Quebec and the men wbo represented it prevented for six snonths the obtaining of a successor to Mr. An'-ers lu the
Federal Ministry. As a consequence, in
January, 1896, Parliarnent met with a Ministry whichi was incomplete. The Speech
from the Throne, the work of the Cabinet,
pr:orised reinedial legisiation; but before
the Address in Reply w-as adopted by the
House of Gommons, a violent crisis broke
ont witbin the Cabinet, and Messrs, Foster,
Haggart, Ives, M.Nontague, Woo0d. Tupper
(the younger), and Dickev ostentatiously
walked out of it, giving as a pretext the
manifeat weakness of the Bowell Government in not being able, thanks to the province of Quebec, to obtain a successor to Mr.
Angers in the Cabinet. This hiappened
about the 4th or 5th of January, 1896.
Following the desertion of the seven
members frorn is Administration, Sir Mackenzie Bowell tendered bis resig-nation to
the Governor General of the tirne, Lord
Aberdeen.
On the 9tb of January the Prime Minister
announced to Parliamient that the Governor
General refused to accept bis resignation.
What, then, ha:d occurred between the 5th
and the 9th of January? On the Sth, about
noon, in the old roorn No. 25 of the Senate,
where Mr. Angers was in conversation with
Senators Bolduc and Landry and three
members of the House of Commons, Messrs.
Dupont, Joncas, and Arthur Turcotte, an
aide-de-camp of Lord Aberdeen knocked at
the door of the room and requested an interview with Mr. Angers. He had corne on
behaîf of His Excellency to ask for the
advice of a member of the Privv Council
as to what course to pursue in face of the
resignation of bis Prime Minister. The adHon. Mr. LANDRY.

vice was given there and then, and the <%vernor refused to accept the resig-nation of
Sir -Mackenzie Bowell while the House of
Commons had not voted its reply to the
Speech from the Throne. The House
adjourned to the 1-4th. Sir Mackenzie bad
time to reorganize bis cabinet and. he had
the Address in Reply adopted by the House.
The crisis was at an end, and the remedial
legislation was subrnited to the deliberations
of the popular chamber.
Sir Mackenzie Bowell was tiien the l-eadeïr
of the Senate; he becarne the enthusiastlc

chief of the Orangemen-and, with an unfailing fidelity and a loyalty which bad
gained for hlm the sympathies of the persecuted. minority, lie fought to the end for

Ln the name of the province of Quebec,
in the name of the Manitoban minority. I
owe and I render to hini the testimony and
the expression of our profound gratitude.
He is no more, but the remembrance of bis
noble conduct remains imbedde*d in the
memory of a whole people. Others bave
praised the statesman, with bis extensive
knowledge, the fruit of long experience. For
my part, I mourn the loss of a sincere friend
of uprigbt character and lofty soul, and 1
can wi-tb confidence add my feeble voice to
the unanimous chorus of praise which is
raised in this Chamber in bonour of the
rnemory of a good man.
Hon. L. O. DAVID: I wisih to add a few
words to wbat bas been so well said of Sir
Mackenzie Bowell, whomn I had the bonour
.and the pleasure of knowing intimately.
When 1 saw Sir Mackenzie Bowell for tbe
first time, bis middle-sized stature was
strong, solid, and well proportioned. With
bis black beard and hair and ihis dark-coloured frock coat, bis aspect was severe and
imposing. Il be bad worn a milit.ary uniform lu the days of Elizabeth, he would
bave been taken for a general of that time.
He occupied then a high position ln the
front rank of the Conservative party,
amongst the best figbters in that party,
under the direction and command of tbe
illustrious Sir John A. Macdonald. Ail bis
outward appearance sbowed signa of firmness and energy, of a resolute mind, of a
tenacious will: he was a perfect type of tihe
first-class Englishman, of the John Bull
described by Max O'Rell. His demeanour
was calse and quiet; bis eyes were sinall,
but expressive, and promptly brightened
Up under tbe influence of a lively sentiment
or of a deep thought, and darted flasbes

mmnd, 8usceptible of great resolutions and
o! feelings of independence. He .seemed to
be made of iron and steel, like tlhe dreadnoughts of to-day. This pro*b.ably accounts
foir bis sympathies for these naval monsters.
ln tact, he wvas a born fighter, either in
w-ar or in politics. H1e showed bis military
propensities wben. ini 1864 and 1866, he
went to the frontier te de!end the country,
and I amn sure that if his services had
been otherwise required, he would have
distinguished himself on the battlefield and
would neyer have surrendered. If he had
been a captain on a war vessel or an admirai, ibe would have blown up bis ship
rather than strike bis colours.
What I have just said is from a pen-picture which. I wrote about forty years ago.
At the age of 93 years he remained as be

had become white, bis body somewhat
bent, but the judgament, the memory,
and the mmnd preserved their vigour.
His great memory filled his speeches
witb tacts and souvenirs which wvere intere.sting and instructive. At the last session
he could get up and 6peak for a long time
without a single note. lJnder the snow
of old 'age the fire stifl smouldered,
and it vas not necessary te stir it much
te make it emit flames. The old lion seerned
te be slunbering sometimes, but oare had
te be taken not to awake him too brusquely.
An Englisb bistorian says of the celebrated. Canning that he had a clEar eye, a
6trong common isense, a sound practical
judgment, a prompt, swift hand to do wbat
was really necessary, and a strong senÉe
of duty. This description of Canning may
be properly applied te the late S'ir Mackenzie Bowel
He had a deep 6ense o! duty
and justice ming-led wîth feelings of benevolence that tempered his combative disposition. H-is temperament was controlled
by a sound judgment and an uprigbt mmnd;
and, as he was courteous, affable, and kind,
and as bis public and private life bad been
honest and respectable, he enjoyed tbe confidence and esteem of the Canadian people.
.He lived for nearly a century on our planet,
and he must have considerably worn out
tbe crust thereof, for ha bae walked much
on it. H1e had seen many kings, emperors,
prime mini-sters, and presidents paseing
and succeed-ing one another; be had witnessed the beginning and the end of repub;lies, kingdoms, and empires. H1e had been
bimself a Prime Minister but for a short
time; he claimed tbat lie met with a nest
which he cbaraeteristically described in
very strang language.

Sir Mackenzie Bowell up to the last
moment preserved his usefuiness in the
Senate and his intellect and vigour. We
shahl miss him in our deliberations and
shall tee] keenly the loss of his vait and
varied experience and of his advice.«
Hon. H. J. CLORAN: Honourable gentlemen, after an acquamntance of 38 years with
the late Sir Mackenzie BoweIl, dating from
the time of my coming from the university
up to the present, I think 1 amn entitled to
offer a tribute of respect and adm:iration for
our departed friend and colleague. If we
only had statesmen of bis stamp in larger
numbers in Canada, Canada wouid be a
happier country than it is to-day. Sir Mackenzie Bowell was at the head of an organization which he made friendly to ail the
other races throughout the Doininion of
Car.ada. He was Supreme Grand Master of
tho Orange Order. That did not prevent
hlmi irom being the bosom friend of bishops.
canons, parish priests, and clergy of every
deriomination. Therefore I say that if we
only had at the head of our affairs more
men of his stamp, this country of ours
would bear a fairer name abroad and be a
happier home for our people. It is a pity
thet not oniy those wbo are charged. in our
legisiatures 'with the intereats and business
of the country, but also men or women in
ail professions, in.ail ranks, whether in the
church, in science, i the arts, in the ranks.
of labour, or otherwise-all who have anything to do with moulding public opinion
-do flot take hlm for a model and follow
his example. Notwithstanding that he was
thý head of an organization which is supposed to be diametrically oppo.sed to
Catholic interests, especially Irish Catholic
interesta and the jnterests of French <Janadian Catholica, he kept that body withîn
bounds, for he was a man who belîeved in
equal rights, equal justice, to ail classes. ahl
creeds, and ail races in this Dominioýn of
ours. Not only did he believe in these principles. but he acted up to them. He did
his utmost, and God will reward him for it,
to have equal justice and equal rights given
to a small minority in this country of ours,
and for that he was driven from power.
This will be remenibered to hlm in the
annals of our history. We spoke yesterday
of the amity, barmony, and union which
ought to exist, in this bountiful country of
ours, upon which God has lavished the best
fruits o! his creation-in the bowels of the

ACT CONSOLIDATION
SECOýND

BILL.

READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of Bill A, an Act to consolidate Tihe Railway Act. He saàd:
Honourable gentlemen, in moving the
second reading of this Bill it is not my intention to review it. As honourable gentlemen know, the Bill is a very lengthy one.
It deals almost entirely with the consolidation of the existing Acts respectoing railways.
I observed in the press a short Limo ago
the statement that in this Bill tîhere
substantial departure from the Bill is a
considered last session by the Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours. Upon looking- into the matter, and
upon making inquiry of the Raiiiway De-

47

partment, I find that that is nost the case.
The Bill now before us for consideration iq
practically the same Bill that came to us
from the House of Commons last eessîon.
Certain amendmen.ts. were proposed iby 'the
Standing Committee on Railways which
manifestly were advantageous, and which
have been incor.porated into 'the Bill whlich
will corne before us for consideration. As
honourahie gentlemen know, there 'were
certain sections touahing railwayé incorpora,ted into the Bill which was before us
for consîderation hast session that have
since become law. 0f couree, those sections will appear in the Bdhl as part of the
general law of Canada affecting railways.
XVhen I had the honour to move the first
reading of ihis Bill, immediately -before 'the
adjournment, iL was suggested that it ehould
be committed 'to the Committee of the
Whole House instead of to the Standing
Committee on Railways. Telegraphs and
Harbours. The isuggestion appealed to my
judgrment. IL seerned to me a very desiraible thing te do, inasmuch as it would gi-ve
every honourable gentleman in the Benate
an opportunity net only to familiarize himself wiljh the Bill, -but to take part in the
discussions which must necessarihy take
place upon it. This Bihl received such
careful and complete consideration at the
hands of the Standing Committee on Railways last session as almost to obviate any
neoessity of again sending it to that cernmittee and having iL deait 'with in pracLically the same way as i-t was deait wit-h
hast session. IL would simply involve a
repetition of the labour uiiich was done at
that time. At that time we had the advanitage of hearing many delegations and
many gentlemen who appeared before the
committee to present their views. In somne
cases effeet was given. to those views,, and
if this Bill were again committed Lo the
same committee I doubL very mucli wthether we would be favoured with any new
views upon the subject, or whether we
would become any mfore familiar with taie
legishation before us than we were then.
Furthermore, even if the Bill were sent to
the Standing Comqmittee on Railways, and
tlhen returned to this Chamiber, any honourable gentleman would have the right to
miove that the Bili-it being a public Billshould be considered 'by the Comm-ittee of
the Whole.«
It is to 'be *hoped that Parliament will
adjourn at a comparatively early period,
and if this Bihll is to go to the House of
Commons at a reasonËbly early date, iL
seems to me dihat the better way of accel-

knmow whether it is now too laite to get Vhat
done or not, but, if it is noît too late, I
would suggWest te my ihionourable friend that
the a]lter-; ions -should be showin that way.
With regard to the question of considering this measure in Coenmittee of the Whole
bouse, I think if we are going te dispose
of it this session it is the most reason-sble
and satisfactory way of dealing wdth it.
The Railway <Jommlittee heard last session,
I think, ahi tihose who were interested in
the different clauses of the Bill and who
wished to be heard. They laid their cases
very fully before t.he cornmittee. 1 think we
shahl do much better by considering the
preslent Bill in Commiittee of the Whole
House rather than by referring it to the
Standing Commi.ttee on Railways.
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: Honouraýble
gentlemen. I want to commend and congratulate the honouraible leader of-the Goverument for at last coming around to iny
way of thinking. I have alwaye advocated
that public Bills should be considered in
Committee of -the Whole House, and have
always deprecated tihe habit that has been
followed in this House for the last ten or
twelve years of sending public Billa to
standing conmnittees where tbey are considered by the members of the respective
comniittees, but where other memnbers are
rather diffident about attending, alfihough
they have -a perfect right to do so. As a mIle,
they do flot attend, and the Bill is dealt
wîth by a quorum of the comîittee, and
then is railroaded through this House without t.he members ot the Senate generally
having an opportunity of studying it. I
think it essential that public -measures
should be dealt with in this bouse. The
standing committees were created for the
purpose of dealing with private Bills; but
when I entered -the Hbuse, about eighteen
years ago, public Bills were invariably mefermed to the Committee of the Wihole. I
am glad to observe th-at the Government is
now coming back to the proper method. I
suppose, now that the Government îs well
entrench-ed, with numerous followers, ut is
inclined to make a good display of its
strength. 'With ités big xnajority it is. perfectiy saf e, -and it feels perha-ps tihat this
matter can be dealt with more easily in
Committee of the Whole bouse.

However, 1 wouhd point out to the Go-vernment that there may be a few questions u-pon which certain persons who
wouhd be able to adduee some new evidence mnight like to be heard. Pe.rhaips
tihere xnay be something in the Bill not
exactly on ail fours, with the Bill -whidh we
had iast year. In the olden days, when
public Bills were introduced, members weme
written to by persons affected by the proposed legisiation, and itheir suggestions
were submitted la this House, with a view
to having changes irîtroduced or certain
proviions taken out. I 4jhink, however,
that provision shouhd be made for hiearing
parties who, like the public, are very much
intemrested-such. companies. for instance,
as the Canadian Pacific or the Canadlian
Nothern, which is now between. heaven
and earth. We bought it last year, -but we
have flot possession of At yet, and the arbitration is stili going on. -Or it may be that
the Grand Trunk or the Grand Tmunk Pýacific
'would 'want ko have their counsel heard. I
would be, as I have stated, very much in
favour of having the LBilH conslidemed by the
Committee of the Whole, but would ask that
thé Government consider the advisability
of meferring particular pointe to Borne committee, say the Committee on Railways,
Telegraphs and barbours, if counsel desired to be heard as to certain points.
Apart from such references, the Bll can be
deait wîth much more, quickly in Comn*mittee of the Whole bouse than by a
standing comniittee, which would meet at
half-past ten o'clock and adjourn at one,
whereas the bouse -meects at two or three
oclock in the afternoon and can meet again
in the evening if necessary.
With meference to the suggestion made by
the honourairle leader of the Opposition
(bon. Mr. Bostock), the honourable leader
of the Government will memember that
when-in 1903, 1 think-the first Consolidated Railway Bill was introduced, the
existing Act was printed on one page and
the proposed changes on the opposite page,
a number of blank spaces being lef t upon
which senators could insert amy a.mendments. That was a very convenient way.
The consolidated Bill of that time was, not
as large a measure as the present one, but
it Was fuhly considered by the Senate. I
think matters would be expedited if the
Government would adopt the idea of having
the ex.isting clauses printed with the proposed new clauses. Once more, befome
taking my seat, I cosnmend the Government for having come around to my wajr
of thinking.

REVISLD EDITION

SENATE

Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlemen, 1 ýthink the honourable gentleman
fromn De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain)
has given the best reason why we Bhould
corne to a conclusion other than the one
which he suggests. He has stated that in
his opinion it rnay be necessary to hear
the parties interested. If such be the case,
that is the best reason why the Bill should
be referred to the Standing Committee on
Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours. For
my part, I regret, and I must say I arn
sornewhat surprised at, the conclusion to
which the honourable leader of the Governmnent and the honourable leader of the Opposition have corne in regard to this Bih.»
The Bill deals with a matter of the greatest
importance, aud with subjects which are
exceedlingly coniplicated and difficuit to
grasp unless proper tirne is given to their
consideration sud the necessary technical
knowledge is obtaîned from the different
parties interested. It is true that the coinmittee spent a good deal of tirne hast seissien in heparing the different interests; but
it was not tirne wasted ; it was turne properly
emiployed. I think that Bills -of this kiud
cannot be deait with properhy in Cornmitteea of thEý Whole. A large -number
of new mernbers have entered the Senate
since last session. Th-ese mernbers will
knlow nothing of the, different views which
were placed before the members of the
commnittee last year. How wilh they be
prepared to give a proper opinion upon any
question which rnay be debateBd and contested and upon which a vote rnay be taken?
I could perhaps have understood the proposed action if the Bill as presenited in
this Blouse had incorporated in it aIl 'the
arndients which were adopted by the
Standing Oomimittee on Rail'ways, Telegraphs and Harbours hast session. In that
eveut there niight have been sorne reason
for dealing with the inatter as proposed,
but I understand that that lts niot the case
aud that a number of important amendments which -were adopted by the committee-inrnany instances unanimously adopted, I think-are not to be found lu the Bihl
as now presented. For iny part, with the
experience I have been able to gather regardinig legisiation froin the turne I entered
this horaourabhe Bouse, I arn satisfied that
this is not the proper way to deal with a
matter of such importance, and 1 regret
exceedingly that the Bill is not referred ùo
thie standing, cornmittee as was doue hast
year. I believe that tirne wihl be wasted
instead of beingý saved. It will take a great
deal more tirne to diseuss the Bill in CornBon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

not be satisfaetory, and iAwill be more expensive, becanse it wil unduly load Our
Debates.
Hon. ROBERT WATSON: Honourable
gentlemen, I heartily concur in what has
jus't been said by the honourable gentleman
who has just taken his seat. I arn strongly
of the same opinion, and I think I voice
the sentiments of the rnajority of this Bouse
when I say that this Bill could be more intelligently discussed- by-the Raihway Coinmittee than by the Committee of the Whole
Bouse. It is impossible for the members
of this Bouse to get sucli teehuical kno-whedge and information as we received hast
year from competent witnesses who appeared before the committee. It caunot be
exptecd, and I venture to say that if this
Bihl bad not been thoroughly discussed by
the Raihway Committee last year sud a
numtber of changes had not been made, the
special Bill decaling 'with labour matters
which was after-wards fathered bv the houourabie gentleman from Welland (Bon. Mr,
Robertson) on behaîf of railw.ay ernployees
would not have been passed. We had very
competent witnesses. There are now in this
Bouse a number of new senators who did
not hear the evidence presented by the witnesses who appeared before the eommiîttee
last year, and these -persons xviii not appear
before thera. While in a standing committee only members of the committee eau

seems to mue that in the suggpestion of my

bar, he is arguing lu one -way sud appealing
to the Goverroment lu aniother. I thiuk that
this Bill, or any other legishation dealing
with transportation, is the most important
kind of legisialtion that cornes before Parlisment, and we caninot bave too much informnation regardiug it. We, know that maniy

session, but paragraph. h was struck out
by the Senate committoee, so as to conforni
witi the striking out by the House of Coninions of the substantive section relating
to returns to the ministers. When the Bill
was under consideration in the House of
Gommons, it was suggested that the statiztical returns of ithe railways .should Ïbe
made to the Minister of Trade, and Commierce. As that suggestion seemed to appeal to the sen-se of the committee, tihis
paragraph was struck out. After reconsideration, it lias now been decided that
railway statistics should be made returnable to the Minister of Railways, consequently the clauses which were orig-inally
in the Bill, and which vwere etruck ouit,
have been restored for the purpose of permitting the returns to be made te the Minister of Railways instead of to the Minister of Trade and Commierce.
Ail the other paragraphs down to paragraph e of subsection 36 were apparently
passed liv us last session. In paragraph e
of subsection 36 we added the following

If Vhat language is used. this provision does

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: But the honourable
gentleman will see t-bat under subsection
b it is thbe provisions of the special Act
which prevail, and rin subsection b of section 3 that principle is maintained. Now,
if we maintain that principle, which is, I
think, t-he proper principle and ffhe one
upon which legisi-ation has always ?been
enacted, 1 doubt very ranch the advisability of enacting- subsection c, because I amn
quite sure it will have .a retroactive effect
and deprive railway companies of righpts
whicb they have obtained by special Acts.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON: By charter.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: If a railway company takes the precaution of copying iuto
its special Act the general provisions, as
has been doue in a number of cases, then
that <'ompany wvill retain the power granted,
and that powver ivould supersede that of thbe
gene-rai Act; but if, as in other casesl, the
railvay company bas not taken the piecaution of incorporating the wording- of thbe
general Railway Act, but bas 'merely incorporated it by reference, that company
will lose the benefit of that provision.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: 1 do not -quite agree
witb the honourable gentleman who has
just taken bis. s-eat with regard to the meaning of subsections b sud c. Subsection b
provides t-bat the ternis or provisions of
the special Act shall prevail over the provisions of the general Act; but under subsection c it is not the terms and provisions
of the special Act it-seif th-at prevail, but
clauses from t-be general Act t-bat aie carried into the special Act. The wording
of the specdal Act prevails under and by
force of subsection b, but I tbink it a wise
and fair provision that. if a special Act ie
passed and tben sections 3, 4 a.nd 5 of a
general Railwav Act are tacked on, and if
it happens that sucb general Railway Act
is chan'-ed bv subsequent legisiation, tben
the special Act should bo changed along

the proposai is perfectlY fair and perfectly
w orkable.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: WXiii you want to

Hon. W. B. ROSS: Take a ýspecial Act
of incorporation passed, s-ay, five years ago,
and consisting of ten clauses. There may
be a general clause at the end saying that
sections 50, 51 and 100 of the geineral Railway Act shall be deerneed incorporated in
it. No-w, subsection c deals with these
clauses -of wbicb I sp6ak.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: And Vhey wîll flot
be incorporated.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: The ten clauses that
I speak, of. as constituting the special Act
are left intact; under subsect.ion b t-bey
prevail as ag-ainst this Act.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Then tbey are
taken away.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: No, %ve are not takingaway those ton clauses at ail.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It seems to me
that if a company bas obtained certain
rights under the Railwvay Act as it bas existed in t-he past, and if a new Act, with

differeut provisions. is passed aud nade
to apply, you are breaking- faith, for instance, with the bondholders, vibio bave

the general Act with those general sections
ia to prevail. WVe are amending the whole
railway law of the Dominion, and the consequence is th-at the incorporation of -enerrai clauses into a private Act must be
brought in.to harmony with what -we are
doing to-day.
Let mie give an instance by way of ilhistr-ation. Under the old Act there was a
limitation of six months for bringing action.
That provision was introduced iu-to certain
special Acts. Since tha. tii-me we have incre.ased the period, so tihat to-day an action
may be bTought at any Urne within two
yeaTs. Now, the idea is that that period
of limnitation shall be gcverned by the general Act of to-day, flot by the general Act
of the year whien the special 'Act ivas
passed. That is an illustration of hou- titis
section will work out. In other words,
where g-eneral clau-ses are introduoed into
a special Act, the g-eneral law of to-dav
nust prevail as to the effect of those clauses.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I take th~e very instance mentioned by the honourable leader
of the Governmient. Take the case cf two
different railway conipanles that have been
incorporated in thle past. In the charter of
one of them, the charter to which the hionourable genitlenan has referred, tlie provision w-as incorporated verbatim that ail
action must be brought within -onie year. In
the case of the secon*d railway comipany.
instead of that part of the Railwav Act
being incorporated in its charter, it waq incorporated merely hy reference. Whiat wvi11 be
the effect of this provision? It will be that in
the case of the firstcompa-ny the period of
one year will stand, while in the case of
te second company tihe period will be two
ve-arsz. Ia th.at fair?
Take another instance, whicli 1 know
lias been of coiiinon occurrence ini railway charters. Take, foT instance, section
247 of the present Raih-vay Act, requiring
that the consent of the ntunicipality muat
be obt.ained by tite r.ailway ccmpany, *and
stating the conditions under wihicit theat
consent miay be obtained. Thiere are dozens
of railw-ay conipanits into witose charters
titat section lias been incorporated verbatimi,
and tiiere are dozens of other railway coinpanies in whose charters itlihas not beeni iiicorporated; therefore, if section 247 is
changed in this new Railway Act, titose w hio
have taken the precaution of having- the
section incorporated verbatim) will continue
to have the benefit of it, whereas otter cernpa.nies will not have the benefit, of it., but
Nvill be subject te tite ne-w leialation. I do
not obJe-ct to the provision if it is to appli

only in the future; but w-bat 1 object to i
titat it bias a retroactive effect, and te such
an extent that, for my part, 1 cannot sep,
îvhat the full effect of the chang-e will be. I
would the-refore suggest that the paragrapit
should stand for further conaideration.
Hon. Mr. MAGDONELL: Thle matter is
ve-ry simple, and surely it can lie disposed
of as we go along. Provision is, made for
two classes of clauses in raîbway Bis. One
is the special clause, which would fail under
subsection b; that is, a clause giving a
company certain extended or additional
powers other than the Raiiway Act generaiiy
affords, and in, which these powers are set
out ini full. Then snbsection c deals with
another class of clauses in any private rail-

wav Act; it deals with the ciasa of clause
tiîat is not set out in detail in any Act
'vhatever, but which is simply legislation
1)v reference, or legialation hy inference.
"«Reference" is the termi used in subsection
c. Suppose a railway company ten years
areo obtained here a charter, or act of incorporation, and provision was mrade in that
charter titat certain sections, enume-rated,
of the thien Railway Act shouid apply to
that company, those sectqon-s would be
provided for and would be covered
by- subsection c of titis Bill.

provisions of this Act govern where it wvas
intended to have the g-enerai Railway Act
appiy at the time the company got its Act
of incorporation. At the
time of its
incorporation, every conîpany wvas bounil
by the provisio&ns of the general Railway
Act, except where they came under subsection b. It is where the general Railway
Act bas been changed that the righits and
powers of these corporations have chianged,
so, that they shall comply with the aiterations of the law. That is ail that paragraph
c means. It is apparently the oid section
which has been acted upon lin the pasi.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Retroactivity is
always a very dangerous thin. and should
be entered upon with a great deal of caution.
The charter of a company consists of two
things, the special charter and the generai
Act. Now, such a companty has certain
powers, and it seems to me it je entitled to
keep thoSe powers. If vou are going te
make chanzes in the general lau' that will
change ail the charters -%iceh have been
granted in years past, where are you goin.to end? And what guarantee do you give to

ibis Act, are we to be ail the time in a

te modify the general lau is a very grave
and serious thinz for ail the companiee that
have been incorporated up to the present
trne. It seeme to me that you wiil be
working- a great hardship. The companies
which have been in existence for yeare have
certain riLhts, and are dependent uapon them,
and our lezisiation ýmai' take many of those
rights away from them.
Without entering
Hon. Mfr. PRINGTLE:
into the question of retroactivity, it would

clause would be paying a high preinium to

1 do not think this Parproper Unes.
lia-ment' can go any further tihan that. It
would ha in accord with the principle of
titis Act. The priniciple hitherto obser-ved
is that if there is a connection between a
railway incorporated by this Parliament
and a provincial railway, the works appertaining to the connection are governed by
this Parliament, but the provincial railway itse]f is flot affectad, and cannot be
affected- Th.is Parliament cartnot assume
jurisdiction over the whole railway. If this
applies to a railway, it should iikawise
apply to the trains or roUling stock on a
railway which do not fall within the jurisdiction of thia Parliament. Then I would
understand that the provision would affect
that part of the rolling stock or the trains
which ivere th-us plaoed under the operation
of a railway w~hich was govarned by this
Parliarnent.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Will the hontourable
gaentlemian ree.d the words agaïn?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It eays:
The provisions of this Act shall, without
limiting the effect of the last preceding section,

(a) every
elsewhere than In Canada and owning, controlling, operating or running trains or rolling
stock upon or over any line or lines of railway
in Canada-

Then I say:
within the juridiction or authority of the Parliament of Canada.

If that rolling stock is not piaced on the
railivay line within the jurisdiction of the
Parliarnent cf Canada, but upon a provincial railway, surely this Parliament has not
the power te deal with it. Then the Bill
goes on Vo say:
either owned, controlled, leased or operated by
such company or companies, whether in either
case such ow%%nership, control, or operation is
acquired by purchase, 1,ease, agreement, or by
any other means whatsoever-

Then the fol]owine words were added:
as regards such trains or rolling stock, and the
running
operating or
controlling,
owning,
thereof.

Hon. W. B. ROSS: Does the addition of
those words niake a section. that is any
different in meaning? You have te read
this Act as you read aIl of our Acts, subject
to this qualification, that the Act applies
only to subject-matter over whjch the Par-

59

liament o.f Canada has jurisdiction.. If it
has not jurisdiction, I do net see that you
improve the situation at ahl by adding the
words.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I arn inclined to
agree with the honourable gentleman; but,
on the other band, why are these very
words in section 5? 1 take it that it is for
the purpose cf avoiding the idea that this
Parliarnent is laying its hands on ail the
railways of the Dominion. I think that
if it is wvise to use 'these words in section
5, it would be equally wise Vo use themn in
section 6.
Hon Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This is
substantially the language cf the law as it
stands to-day, and as it has stood since the
statute of 1909 was passed. It reads as
follows:
The Provisions of this Act shall apply to(a) any -and ai railway eompanies incorporated elsewhere than in Canada and owning,
controilling, operating or running trains or
rehling stock upon or ever any line or lines of
railivay in Canada, either owned, controlled,
leased or eperatad by such railway cornpany or
cempanies, whether in either case, such ownership, control or operation Is acquired by purohase, lease, agreement, control of stock, or
'by any other means whatseever.
(b) Any and ail raitway companies operatIng or running trains froim any Point in the
United States te any point in Canada.

We certainly must assume that wa are
legislating, and can only legisiate, upon
subjects coming within the jurisdiction of
the Parlianient of Canada.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The honeurable gentleman is readingu fromn the Act of 1909. I
amn quite aware that the provision is to be
found there, but I arn aware aise that the
question came up before the Railway
Board, and that Board was tempted te
assume jurisdiction because of the wording
cf that Act. I wvas quite eure that the
Railway Board liad no such rîght, and I
have wait-ed to sea if they weuld attempt
Vo enferca the views which they expressed. I
considerable importance that we
think, it is okf
should close the doors to litigation cf that
ki.nd. If it is the intention cf this Parliamient Vo affect roiiing -stock cf the kind
referred to ini this section, wvhich is placad
on a provincial railway, let us have the
coura.ge to say s0; but I assume that that
is not eur intention, and, if it is not, then
let us say, as we do in section 5, that 'we

The policy of

as possible ail roads and aIl rolling stock

If the policy which would be the outceme
ef in\. honeurabla friend's (Hon. Mr. Béi-

quels) suggesticni were put into for-ce, it
would mean that any foreign cars might
be operated upon Canadian railways and
the foreigcn railway company could dlaim
exemption from the provisions of this Act.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: But the honourable
gentleman see that that is not the object
of the law. What will take place if that
wordinga is maintained and if this Parlisment lias the power to pass leg-isiation of
this ki.nd, which I dlaim we have flot? It
would follow that a provincial railway,
whieh is altogether under the jurisdiction
of the province. would be under two jurisdictions if it were to borrow or lease an
engine or cars fromn an American railway
and operate those cars or lhat engine on
its own lines. Those eng-ines and cars
would be under the jurisdiction of the provincial authority and under that of the
Dominion Parliament. Surely that would
not be logical, and the door should not -be
opened to any contention o! that kind. 1
quite agree with the policy which was
adopted in 1903, when we revised the Railway Act, that ail connections between a
Federal and a provincial railway should be
governed by the legislation o! this Parîxament; but the moment we go beyond that
and atternpt to deal wjth a provincial railway itself, or a portion of it, which is flot
at ail connected with a Federal railway, we
are, 1 think, overstepping our jurisdiction.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I would like to point
out to the honourable gentleman the effect
of the two last ulnes *at the foot of page 6.
Thosze lines show very clearly whiat this subsection a mneans. Suppose the New York
Central leases a railway in Nova Scotia or
in Ontario. Under this subsection it is made
si!bject to this Act. This Act does flot deal
with thc provincial railway at all; it deals
only -%itli a foreign company which owns,
controls, leases or operates a railway in
Canada. So long as the provincial railway
is heing -operated by the eompany incorporated, this Act does not toucli it; it
touches only a foreign comnpany that acquiies a provincial railway, and in that respect there can be no want of jurisdiction.
Hlon. -Mr. BEIQUE: But take the case
where there are only a dozen coaches rented
and they are operated on a provincial railway.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: No, the subsection does
not state coaches. It mentions "trains or
rolling stock upon or over any lino or lines
o! railway in Canada either owned, controlled, leased, or operat-ed by such company. I

Hon. '-%r. BEIQUE: Coaches are rolling.
stock.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Now, to corne -%ithini
subsection a, the line or lines of railway
miust be owned or operated hy the foreign
cornpany.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I move
the adoption of this subsection, and 1 would
suggest to my ho nourable Iriend (Hon. Mr.
Béique) that if, when the discussion took
place on the passage of the general law in
1909, any good reason exisfed, we cani reconsider if. I move its adoption in the
ineant ime.
Subse-ctions a and h) of section 6 were
agreed to.
On subsection c of section 6-railways controlled or operated by Dominion companies:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Sutbsection c was stricken out last session and has
now been restored. The wording is the samne
as it was last smession. The object of this
subsection la to exercise Federal control
over, say, two railway systems, one of which
is Federal and the other provincial, se a-s
to bring within the authority of this Act
sucli a condition as that to which. I have
referred. The abuse which has been experiencod under such a condition is that two
rates of freiglit can be charged and collected. It is very desirable that a through
freight rate be obtained where a railway is
o-perating say a Federal and a provineial
system. Therefore it is desirable to hring
the provincial road under the authority of
the Board for the purposes mientioned in
the subsection.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Does it not do more
thon that? The end of the clause says:
Anci every raiway or portion thereof now or
hereafter so owned, controlied, ],eased or operated
shall be deemed and is hereby declared to ho
a work for the general advantage of Canada.

It is made entirely a Federal road.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, it
niakes it a Federal road.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I do flot think th-at
this Parliarnent bas the riglit te declare
that every ra.ilway or portion thereof sihall
be dee.med a work for the general advantage
of Canada. I understandâ that under the
Britishi North America Act we have the
right te declare raîlways to be works for the
general advantage of Canada; but that implies that Parliament siha.ll exercise its
judgrnent in deciding thaît thle particular
r-ailw1ay la a wvork for the general adva.ntage of Canada. If we can do this, we can

declare that practieally ail] works are for

Dominion.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
sk my honourable friend if this is more extraordinary tihan what we do at every ses,ion of Parliament. In dealing- with smal
provincial ro.ads, even street railways, we
say they are 4or the general advantage of
Canada and thus m.ake Federal systems of
them.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I think that some
declarations that have been made are extraordinary. but at any rate we shoiild remain withîn the powers given by the constitut-Jon, and I respectfully submit that we
canaiot declare in a general way;' wit'hout
specifying the particular railway, that
every -railway or portion of railway is for
the general advantage o! Canada*

But where such regulation, order, or decision

arose IbefoTe the com'mittee wa6 howv the

not the'ught that the Board could do otherwise than do it by the courts. If the honourable gentleman desires te maintain subsoeion 5, hie should tell us how ýthe worlting
of it will be effected.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It w-ould
seem to be unnecessary Io tell rny boueur-

63

aible friend that the re6ourcefulness cf the
Railway Board will have to be exercised te
find out horw it will Ïbe doue. There is -ne
use in .having a railýway board unlesel it
exercises its ingenuity in discovering how
te en-fo-rce its ewn eiders. I think possiibly
the word "motion" rinighlt, have been used
in6tead. cf the word "action." T.hey are
s-ynonymous.
However, if the Railway
Board is hel-plesez, it 'will net do any harm
te have this provision in the statute. It
throws uponi the Board the responsibility
of wor.king eut its own orders.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Dees the honourable
gentleman think that we should pass a Bill
which, on its face, dees net previde for its
own working? If hie desires 'te make it clear,
I would suggest that the words ",of its
motion" be added in subsection 4. You
surely would net add subseetion 5 without
making provision for its enforcement. Subsection 4 is te be enforced ithrough the
courts, and I think subsection 5 should he
enforced in the saine way.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It seems
te me that the question ha ,s net resolved
itself into'how the Board is going te enk~re
it se much as whether it is iu the public
interest that the Beard shoFuld give effect
te the order rather than rely upon the courts
to do se. That is te szay, the Board inay
make a certain order, and a court may net
have the machinery te give effect te it, or
it rnay be dilatory. Under the provision,
the Board may take action, and it seems te
me that the object is a comrnendable one.
Section 49 was agreed te.
Sections 50 and 51 were agreed te.
On section 52-Governor in Council may

,constructed. As my honourable friend will
see, under section 16, an amount May be
depcisited with the board te ensure payment for the construction of the ispur; consequently the railways would have ne
right te remove such a spur; and, as a
limitation pursuant te either o4f the last
twc preceding sections is incorporated in
this section, it i6 manifest that the section
should remain as it is.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The peint which was
rai&ed 'by the railway coxnpanies before the
committee last ses,.ien was that industrial
spurs are built either by agreement -between
the parties or by order of the board. - t is
quite proper that a spur which is constructed by the order et the Board should
not -be removed except with the consent ef
the Board; but there would seeni te be ne
geod reasont why spurs censtructed by agreement between the parties, withont reference
te the Board, înany et themn of a temperary
character,

shouid net be remeved if'the

owner cf the industry is agreeable. It is
for these reasons that the amendinent is
submitted. You see, it deals with sections
187 and 399 at the sanie tinie. The suggestien made by the rail'way cerupanies was as
follews:
Any company or persen who, without consent or order ef the Board, renoves any spur
or branch lUne constructed under or pursuant
to the provisions of this Act'for the purpese
of affordting railway facilitles te or in connection n-ith any lndustry or business establUshed or Intended to be establlshed, shail be
liable on conviction to a penalty net exceeding
one thousand dollars.
My
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
honcurable friend will observe that this
deals 'with spurs that have been constructed
by order of the Railway Board. That being
the case, an order cf the Board should certainly be ebtained before such a spur is
removed.
Hon. 'Mr. BEIQUE: 0f course, unier
section 33 o! this Act the Railway Board
hbas ample pewers te protect the public.«
For instance, subsection 2 et section 33, te
which. the railway cempanies objected, is the
old law, but it is very drastic. Under that
provision, the Railway Board bas full power
te order the construction of spur lines. The
railway companies should net object tei
that power 'being exercised by the Railway
Board, -but they do object te the company
being prevented froni rexncving a spur 'which.
is built according te the ternis o! a contract between the railway com.pany and the
individual or induQtry concerned.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: lEles not
rny honourable friend appreciate' the fact
8-51

this section deals only with spurs concerning
which an agreement has flot been arrived
at and may flot be arrived at? If my
honourable friend will look at line 12 of
section 185, he will see that it deals with
spurs upen which the parties cannot agree.
It says:
When any Industry or business established
or Intended to b. established. w1thin six miles
of the raiiway, and the. owner of such industrY
or business, or the person Intending to estab115h the samne, la desirous of obtaining railway
facilities ln connection therewith, but cannot
agree with the. comçs.ny as to the construction
and operatioxi of a &pur or iiranch line from
the ra.ilway thereto, the Board may, on the
application of such ewner or person, and upon
being satisfled of the necessity for such sPur
or branch lino in the Intereats of trade, order
the company ta construct, maintain and operate
sucb spur or branch Une.

Tihen the Board adjudicate upon the aubject and inake -an order, -and they require
the party interested te deposit an a.mount
for the building of the spur, and se on.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Take section 186
now.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Section
186 deals with the same kind of spur, but
one that .ray -be used by -more tb.an one
party.
Hon. Mr. CASGRÂIN: It oeay be used
hy soine one furbher on.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
some one (beyond. Then, section 187 is limited te spurs which. are censtructed under*
sectiions 185 and 186, namely, spurs that

have been, constructed ,by order of t.he
board and cencerning which. the parties
,cannot agree between themselves.

Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: The rea-sons
advanced by the Railway Board in favour
of this section are as follows. This is a new
section intended te make the control of
the board in such mnatters more coruplete,
because, as bae been pointed out by the
honcurable leader of the Governinent, this
section applies only te, that class of spurs

which are buit or are extended by order of
the Railway Board. If a rail-way company,
aftex being ordered te put down or te, extend a spur, under section 185 or 186, can
remove it tihe next day, as they can unless
section 187 is in the Bill, the whole thing
is nugatcry.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:

Section 187 was agreed te.
Sections 188 te 218, inclusive, were agreed

On section 219-arbitrators: if suri offered flot accepted:
Hon. Mr. MEIQUE: Tiàs, is a very important section. The commnittee concluded
to substitute the following for the section
as it is printed:

Hon. W. B. ROSS: Speaking, generalýly,
I agree with the remarks of the honourable

xnethod of assessing damages by arbitrators
of course only belongs ta a past age. It is

APRIL 9, 1918
should provide au appe-al, but onhy as to a
question of law.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I quite agree with
Vhe 'honourable gentleman.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: That is one way of
stating lt--or against the principle upon
which the judge proceeded Vo assess the
damages. I had something to do in an
indirect way with an assessment oi damnages
within the hast six inonths. It was in the
city of Halifax. The judge who assessed
the damages did so on certain principles.
1 need not go into the det 'aile. The matter
went intèo the full court, and iV was pretty
well demonstrated that the judge lhad
proceeded on a wrong iprinciphe altogether.
The judge was, told: "That will not do; the
case must be reconsidered, you wihl proceed
te assesa, on the following princîple."ý He
did so, and that was the end of the matter.
There are many different. points of view
from which. an assessment 1nay -be approached. Sometimes it is a dwelling which
is to be assessed; or it mnay be a dwelling
and business place cornbined; or it may
be .purely a place of business. The Engliah
and the French courts do not assess damages
on the same principle for so many feet of
]and for a dwelling and se rnany .feet of
land baken as a business stand, hecause a
dwelling house can be replaced without great
difficuhty, but property that bas been used
as a place of business for perhtaps fifty
years is a good -business holding. I think
we ought to provide that tihere shah] be an
appeal from the judge.
Hon. M. CASGRAIN: If there la to be
an appeal, would you not limit the amount?
Surely you should not ahlow an appeal if
the amount la onhy trifling.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There la
a himit now: it ja $600 and over. Look at
section 232.
Hlon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I thought that
ast year wve had taken out the word
"arbitrators."
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We did.
Hon. Mr. GASGRAIN: And here they
turn up ag-aîn. We cannot get rid o! them,
apparently. The committee unanimously
decided that there should be no arbitrators,
and here they are-the same ohd arbitrators. I do not see why the judge does not
remain -a judge-why he sbouhd become an
"arbitrator." The judge of the Exchequer
Court does not become an arbitrator; he
rrmains a judge. Let the case be tried by
a judge, and take the -word "airbitrators"
Out.

Hon. W. B. ROSS: There is a section
which says that the decision of the arbitrators shall be final.
Hon. Mr. CA'SGRAIN: Where is the six
hundred dollar limit men.tioned?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: In what section did
my honourgble friend (Hon. Sir James
Lougheed) say that six hundTed dollars was
mentioned as the limit in connection wivth
the appeal?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Section
232. 1 was going to suggest that inasmuch
as the Senate Committee last session gave
a great deal of attention to the amendment
of these clauses, we should accept the
amendments made by the Senate Committee. 0f course, when the Bill goes to the
Commons, if they differ with us, they are
at liberty to do so.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is satîsfactory, so long as we take out the word, "arbitrators."
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: But I should like to,
have an expression of opinion from members of this House. so that when the matter is taken up by the House..of Commons
they will understand our position fully.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I may
say that when this Bill was before the
special committee of the House of Commons
hast year, they favoured having the arbitration done .by a judge, but, when the Bill
went into the House of Commons it was
ahtered; the House of (Jommons did not
accept that proposal, but adopted the old
method of having three arbitrators. Thus
we have that difference of opinion, the
Hou8e of Commons determiniflg one thing
and the special committee of the House of
Commons determining- another. The Senate
committee very carefully elaborated these
ameudments as to the appointment of
judges.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The Bill as draf ted by the Minîster of Railways hast year
contained the word "judge," and the committee let it stand at that. When the Bill
came to the House of Commons the word
"arbitrators" was inserted.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
suggest now as a solution of the question
that in the nieantime we should accept the
amendments which were worked out by the
Senate committee last session as to the
principle of the arbîtration being by a
judge, and then any honourable gentlemen
wilh have the right to move reconsideration of the section before we make our

SENATE
report. Has my honour-able friend (Hon.
Mr. Béique) put in the amendment to section 219?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I think it was understood that the Law Clerk of the committee was to work out the other sections.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:: I have
those before me now, and, if my hononrable
friend wishes, I will read the clauses as
prepared by the Law Clerk, carrying out
the views of the committee.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I have 219 and 220,
but section 221 1 have flot had tîme to
prepare.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: Section 221
deals only with determining compensation.
Section 221 would remain as it is.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It would flot mention "the arbitrators."
The honourable
gentleman will see that it cannot remaîn as
it is.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Even if
the plural form were adopted, it would be
governed by the Interpretation Act.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: But it would be the
judge who would be the arbitrator.
Hon. Sur JAMES LOUGHIEED: Yes. The
amendment to be substituted for section
219 would read as follows:
(1) If within ten days after the service of
such noticýe, or, where service is made 1»' advertisement, withjn one month after the flrst
publication thereof, the opposite Party does not

Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: Why flot make

would be fairer to give him more time.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEBD: I will accept that.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: Where the word

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Now, it
seemas to me that the words -"countycourt
should be chang-ed.
Or, lIn any other pet of Canada where there

i no county court, ta a judge of the Superior
CourtI think the words - district court"- should
be added. There are no county court judg-es
in the provinces of Alberta and askatchewan; there are district judg-es.
Hon. Mr. BEIQL7E: The word - judge"
is interpreted. Let us see.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, it is approaching -six o'clocc
and wýe have made very satisfactory progress to-day. I ýshall give attention to having these proposed amendments properly
drafted for the purpose of carrying out the
policy which the Senate Committee adopted
last session, and at our next sitting I ivili
bring down the amendments properly
drafted.
Hon. Ntr. BEIQUE: I n-ould point out
ta the honourable gentleman that the meaning of the word " judg-e " is deflned.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: In the ixiterpretation section of this Bill?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Yes.
(13) "Judge' means a judige of a sup)eriGr
or county court.
We migaht add to that "or district court."
I am altogether in accord with the suggestion made by the honourable gentleman
from Middleton (Hon. Mr. Ross) that there
should be a righlt of appeal on questions of
law only, and I would sugae st that the proper amendments be also prepared for the
purpose of carrying out that sug-estion. I
do not think it is advisable that thefinding-s
of the judge as to facts should be snbmitted
to appeal; but on a question of law only, if
the judge acts upon a wrong principle, there
should be an appeal.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAJN: The honourable
leader of the Government said that in the

tor." If the arbitrator is to 'be'a judge, why
ziot put in " judge?"
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is an
arbitration.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Why not eay
arbitrationP - Do not say " arbitrator."
There will be no arbitrators.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I will
have that properly corrected.
Hon. Mr. CASGRÂIN: Another thing. In
the old law it was provided that if the party
who was offered the money for his land did
net protest or refuse within a certain tixne,
the company took possession for that
amount of money. It is.net exactly that;
but, of course, I have not the text of the law
before me. You see, the cempany made the
offer to the other party, stating in its notice:
"If you do not accept this amount within
ten days, the company hereby appoints
so-and-so an arbitrator, and you will have
te appoint your arbitrator within ten days."
If the other party failed to appoint an
arbitrator within the ten days, the company
entered into possession of the land and the
other party kept the money. The company
foreclosed without any further action. That
matter will have te be adjusted, because,
as the wordîng appears in the Bill, the
farmer would be required to notify the cernpany within a certain time. That is not
the way it is doue. The section should
provide that the company shahl netify the
farmer first, and then, after the lapse of a
certain number of days, say twventy days,
or whatever period is cousidered proper, if
the fariner does not accept the amount
offered, the coînpany shal -serve him with
legal papers and notify him that the matter
Mvill be taken te court. I do not know if I
amrnmaking myseif clear.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hou. Mr. CASGRAIN: If the other party
did net say anything, the company took it
for granted that he accepted the money.
If bis answer notified the company of the
appointment of his arbitrator, that implied
that he did net consider the arnount offered
sufficient. But, as the section in this Bill
is worded, the procedure is reversed; it is
the farmer who wou]d have te notify the
cornpany. which might be embarra.sing.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No; either
party may apply.
Section 219 stands.
Progress was reported.

BUSINESS 0F THE SENATE.
PUBLIC BILLS IN COMMITTEE.

Belore the Orders of the Day:
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I woiild like te aBk
a question in respect to the procedure
adopted with regard to the last consolidatien of the Railway Act. I have net very
full information-some senator may have
fuller-but I arn informed that the hast consolidation teck place lu Committee of the
Wihole House and a large number of amendmniets were made. I would like te know if
that is the case.
Hon,. Mr. CASGRAIN: Perhaps the honourable gentleman refers te wvhat I was sayin- on Monday, when the question came
Up.

Hon. Mr. ROSS: Yes, that is the subject. Before we proceed te order No. 1, I
would like te know something about it.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I inay expla.in
new that it was iu 1903 that tihe Raiiway
Act was consolidated, and lu the Sexiste
the Bill was deait with by the Committee
of the Whole House. It was net re'ferred te
the Standingz Comrnittee on Railways, Tele-raphis and Harbours at ail. When I made
thiat statenient the otiher evening I thought
my rnemory wvas serving me rightly, but I
was co.ntradicted. I heard several mnembers
behind me saving, "No, ne." I do not
know exactly w~he they were. I have taken
the trouble te look up the question very
ca.refully, and I find that in 1903, ou August
20, as showrni in Hansard of that year, at
page 799, Hon. Sir Richard Scott, then
leader of the Goverunent in tihis House,
moved:
That the Bill be referred to a Committee of
the Whoie House.

There was considerable discussion as to
whether that wvas the proper procedure or
net. The late Sir Mackenzie Bowell, who
was then leading the Opposition, suggested,
&vith bis ýusua1 alertness, b;hat 'the !Bill
niight be sent te the Railway Committee;
but the large majority of the House, witheut a vote. decided ýthat, it being a public
Bill, the proper place for it te tbe discussed
çvas rig-ht here in the Heuse. At that time
1 advocated tihiat as it was a public Bill it

72

SENATE

sheuid be discussed iii Comimittee, of the
Whole, and that only private Bis should
be referred te standing coinimittees, where
the in'terested parties could, be heard, so
that it could be seen whether a private Bill
should be approved or amended or otherwise
deait 'wit'h. A public Bill is a different matter, and At is net fair te the public gen,
erally te refer it te a standing ceimmittee,
because the whole of the peeple cannot
appear before such a com.mittee, and they
are the ones who are interested in the Bill.
Two classes o! people can appear beifore the
committee-those who have influence with
the comrnittee and those who have net. If
the former appear before the cornmittee,
influence is brought te bear by interested
parties; i.! tihe latter, they have no influence, and it is ne use hearing them. Either
way -we are on the horns of a diieima. In
my view At is much better te discuss public
Bills in Committee of the Whoie. Last Monday it was argued aise that the Bill weuld
be expedited if it were referred te the
Standing Gommittee on Railways. I do
net know that that comrnittee could have
done rnuch better than we did yesterday.
We passed over two hundred sections o!
the Bill, enly two or three being allowed te
stand. In support of this I may refer te
what occurred in 1903. 1 have before, me
a copy of Hansard of that year, which wili
bear eut everything I say. On the 20th ef
August the Bill was, întroduced, and on the
25th e! September it 'vas read the third
turne and passed by this Bouse. bundreds
of pages of Hansard are covered by the discussion which took place. In, that session
the Senate took recess frein the 4th of September until the 24th and the usual business
o! the House ivas carried on; therefore, I
doubt whether any standing cernrittee couid
do any botter. This Chamber sits frein three
o'clock in the aiternoon until any heur o!
the nig-ht, if necessary. The conselidation
ef the Railway Act in 1903 was a very important one. The Raiiway Board ivas at
the saine tinie created, and the necessary
machiner ' provided for carrying on its

the Board se created has given great satisiactien. This ail goes te show that the
legislators who put through that Bill acted
in the best interests of the -country. At that
sanie session, we deait with highway crossing-s, and also with a sinail matter which
may be of interest, te sorne of the later arrivais iii this bouse. I refer te the Bill which
gave us the righit te travel free on ail railways under Federal jurisdictien, by iiierely
preSenting our identification cards. In pass'Hon. -Mr. CAS(TtA-1N.

had presented a Bill with the saie obje4cît;
and, whether the granting of the-se passez

was right or not, it did net interfere
with the independence, of Parliament.
It waa no hardship for the railways, in
view of the fact that they wer-e aiready
giving passes, and it was thought better
that they shouid do it according to law.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE: I wish to cail t.he
attention ci the Speaker to the fact Iliat
there is nothing, before the Chair. M
honourable friend is entirely out of erder.
The Hon. the ACTING SPEAKER: I

I understand that the honourable gentleman

of these who aaid, -"No, no," and perhaps
hie does not like me te prove that I was
right.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE: I did not say
no.
Hon. Mr. CASGR.AIN: The Senate nmade

in by the House of Commonis. The HlouEe
of Commnons dissented frein the other thirteen amiendrnent-, îvhich. were referred back
here. A conference between the two Houses
was ùeld. The Senate, very .properly standing on its dignity, would not as.k for a conference; so the House of Gommons appointed managers, -who appeared in reoom

after they hiad taken their seats, with

PUBLIC SERVICE REARRALNGEMENTS
BILL.
SECOND READlING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved
the aecond reading oi Bill 2. an Act to
authorize Rearrangenients and Transfmr of
Duties in the Public Service. He said: The
dbject of this Bill is to give power to the
Governior General to transfer any duties
or functions oL any existing department to
some other departument. Honourable gentleimen eau very well appreciate, probably,
-the desirability of consolidating departments àf, in the interests of efficiency and
publie welfare, that cati be done. There je
nothing on. the statute-book to permit of
the Goverument giving effect to transfers
of th-is character. It has been done with
reference to certain departments, but at
this particular tiine àit j desirable thst
there should be an investigation in-the interests of economy and efficiency, with a
view to coimbining the different departments
of Government, if it is in the public intereet.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honourable
gentlemen. I think the Governenent is to. be
congratulated upon taking these powers in
connection -with thie Bill. Any honourable
gentleman who hus studied what ie going
on in the coun'try at the present tijne must
realize that a great deal of good work cen
be done iby bringing togethp-r certain departments and trying to co-ordinate the
work of the country. There is unfortunately,
I think, a gretat deal of overlapping, not
only amongst departments, but amonggt
some of the commissions which the Governmenit hae thought well to appoint within
the last year or two. This overlapping ie
causing -a great deal of expense and unnecessary Kwork throughout the co'untry,
which I think mnight be avoided, and i
hope, as a recuit of this Bill, that this whole
question will be very thoroughly looked
into an>d that improvements. will be made.
I might take this opportunity of drawing
the Government's attention to the position
in the Department of Mines at the present
time. That depa.rtmient je one that I.think
h'ae never received proper consideration at
the fhands of the Government since it was
ests.blished. ît is a moet important department, because it deals with one of the
most importa-nt natural resources of this
country. The mines supp]y a great deal of
traffic and business te. the railways. Our
Department of Mines was, estab]ished six
years ago, s-ince 'which time it bas been
under the charge of no less tihan eight

73

difierent niinisters. That ie not a gocd
thing for an important departmient of this
kind. If ii is possible to put the department undec a strong min-ister, -and to keep
him in charge of it, the resuit musit greatly
help the work of the department and help
the officiais to carry on their investigations
with more satisfaction. The Departmnent o!
Mines is to-day a large department, having a
large number of highly paid officiais who are
cempetent, to do a great deal o! excellent
work for the counîry; but if the department is shifted arbout as it has been in the
past, andi is not placed under a minister
who will be solely responsIble for it, I fear
it will suifer in consequence. Alter. the
war je ever, the question of the development o.f the natural resources of the country is godng to ïbe a serious one, and the
Department of Mines has more to do witb.
the na.tural resources of Canada, and will
continue to have more Vo do with them,
than almost any other department: At the
present time we have, in addition to the
Department of Mines, one or two commissions dealing with. questions which come
under the jurisdietion of the departmnent,
and we have also a branch of the Interior
Departrmenit which deals with mines. I
think that, -,'hen this Act is put into force,
this whole matter qshould be taken into
consideration, and the Mines Department
should be made an independent department
under a res-ponsible minister.
As an indication of the importance of the
minerai industry from a national standpoint, I might state that in 1915 trhe tonnage
supplied to the railways by different industries w-as as follows: Products of mines
37-89 per cent; products of agriculture,
18-79 per cent; products cf the foreets, 16-3
per cent; and manufactured produets, 14-76
per cent. Honourable gentlemen will. cee
frein these figures that the tonnage supplied to the railways is about fifty per cent
cf the Votal tonnage which they receive,
which bears out the staternent which I
have -made with regard Vo the importance
o! the developinent o! mines in this coun,try. In addition, 50,393 men were employed
in mineral industries furthering- the manufact.uring of prcducts of the min-es; 104,425
men were employed in,. mining, ssnelting
and related industries. In the year 1915, the
value of the products of those i'ndustries
was $265,046,«0.
We have to-day t<e consider the question
of finding work for a large number of mien
after the war je over, and the Departinent
cd Minee can do more probably th-an any
other diepartment to find cuitivble work for

74

SENATE

men 'who corne back from the front, and
for -nen who are to-day employed in other
industries. Now is the time for this matter to 'be taken int-o consideration, and, in
my opinion, it cannot be conimenced tao
soon. I therefore hope that when this question cornes to be deait *with, the Gavernment wiil give great consider-ation to the
question of dealing with the Department
of Mines.

I need soarcely peint out that a very restricted experirnent bias been. made in Canada for Vhree or four years -past with a
measuTe of this character, but it ih~as lacked
that st.atutory authority which was necessary to miake it a success. It is of course
rnanifest that a change in .timne such as is
proposed cannot lie carried out unless it
be made obligatory upon the entire cernmunity-unless it lias etiatutory authority
behind it-un.less it becernes part of the
general law of the land. It ia felt, fromn
representations mnade to the Governient
by representaitives of the different activities
of life in Canada, that the Goverrneât will
be justified in lalling into line, not only with
the United States, but with the nations in
Europe te which I have referred, in adopting tls nieas;ure. I ihave the honour, therefore, to move the second reading, of the
Bill.
Hon. W. C. EDWARDS: Can the honourable gentleman Say how long the change
is to be effective? As I understand it, there
is to lie an immediate advance, cf one hour,
but inay 1 ask, for what leng-th of time it
is proposed th-at blie timne shall continue as
so fixed?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The Bill
leaves it to the Governor General in Council to decide that; but I rnay say to mv
honourable friend that in ail prc'bability

essential tihat Canada should do likewi-se,

*bjeet of thîsý fiBils dayligiht-saving.
Ne saving whatever can be made until the
auturnn months arrive. The practice of our
flrin has been te change net at thuis trne,
but on thie lat of September. After that
date we begin te put our trne ahead and
by the 30th or penShaps -the 15th cf November it is ene heur ahead. No saving of dayliglif cen be mnade te the farmer. The change
will be of ne advantage whatever te the
farmer, nor will it be any detriment te
blin. I cannot imagine any class that wil
be prejudUcially affected by putting the tisne
aîhead ne'w; but the great saving mn electric
lighting can be made in the autumn cf the
year, -and if ever there lias been a time ini
the lp.story cf Canada and the UnitedStates when the saving cf power lias been
requisite that tâme is now. The whole
object of flua Bill will be lest if the tixne 'la
put back in fhe autumn months. An enormeus saving can be made if the time is
advanced then or is net put back. So, while
it may see-ni rather absurd fer one like
myself te spleak iii thia mnainer affer varieus
countries have in their 'wisdom decided
eitherwise, I ain judging by an experience
ef fifty years, for it is fifty years since our
firrn began te put the tirne ahead on the
1st day cf Septetuiber. When the umenth of
Septemnber arrives work can lie started at
6 e'clock in the merning, and by changing
the trne te one heur aliead of that period
rne artificial lighting is required in the moming and the efect is te lessen the artificial
lighting for one heur in the evening. By
this means an enernious saving would
accrue to the United States and Canada.
This as a very serious question, but Canada cannot deal with it as I have suggested
unless the United States does likewise.
Hon. H. J. CLORAN: If this henourable
Heuse will bear wlith rue, I wculd effer a
few suggestions te the Governirent or te fthe
minister whe la responsible for thds Bill.
In tie first place, the title is nef correct;
it bs net in line with the f acts. The title
ef the Bill is, " an Act te provide fer the
time in Canada being in advance cf the

lias made ýit -a iinomer. If the time is to
be put forward duririg 'the sumnier montihs,
the change applies for only three months.
We have four sasonýs in Canada. The summer anonths -are from June 21 Vo September
21; therefore the titie ie flot in acceord with
what the Governiment intends. Wihat the
Go>vernment wants is an advance of the
time for six months. T.he Bill should so
state, but the titie limîts the period to the
summer month-July, August and Septeni.
ber. Nobody in. this Canada of ours will
eall this a sunimer month. There is zero
weather and snow in Winnipeg and the
temnperature bere in Ottawa is at freezing
point.
As Vo the interpretation of expression of
time, I would point out Vo the rndnister respousible. for th-is Bill that section, 4 containts a provision wbich limits tihe efficiency
of the Bill. It says 'wherever any statute,
Order, in ýCouncil or any other document
coaning within the legislative juudsdiction of
the Parliament -of Canada centainis any referenlce Vo the element of tirne, the time mentioned or referred Vo shahl be subject Vo the
provisions of this, Act. 'flhen in section 2
th-e words, - for general purposes in Canada," appear. That phrase limits the eifficiency and thea dequacy of the Bil1 Vo
Federal matters. In the province of Quebec-and I suppose iît is tbe same in other
provinces-there are general purpeses of the
province whioh are not controlled -by Faderai legisiation at ai, and w.bich tbis Bill
wi]i noet cev.er. For instance, the provinces
bave the cright to say wben courts shaîl
sit and beiw long tbey shahl sit, when they
shall open and when they shall close.
These matters are within provincial jurisdiction. Another generai purpes-e of the
provinces is the maintenance of jails, t.he
control of priseners, etc. I understand Vhat
penitentiaries corne under the Federal law
and xviI be affected ýby this Bill, but there
are provincial institutions serving a generai purpeýse -%which shouid corne under this
Bill and for tvhich no provision is made.
Se far as I can sea, the, different provinces
wili be required, under the circumstances,
te supplemnent this Bill in- order to. make
it absoiutaely censtitutionial. Anybody wbo
wanted to take exception to ih.is t-lause cf
the Bill could effectively doso from a legai
point cf view, and I would not like-Vo-sea
th-at done. This Bill, as -the bon-ourabie
gentleman fromn Rideau (Hou. Mr. Edwards) has stated, isin line with the rnarch
of events throug-hout the world, especiaily
in line xitih the rn.arch cf avents in tbe
lion.' 'Mr. CLORAN.

Uinited Staites, and whAther we lil<e it or
not, the change must *be accepted. Once
the -Goverument bas decided t(> make the
ch-ange, a law should be passed wheïreby
the change would becomne effective and universal. If it is necessary to get tihe consent of the provinces toe changing the heur
for theii general purposes, let that be done.
It would not be necessary to cail the legislatures to assemble; the diffexrnt provincial cabinets could meet and pass ordera
in council in acýordance with this measure.
These are suggestions I would offer s0
that tèhe Bill *may 'be made effective and
efficient and flot 'be tampered with by any
legal proceedings.
Hon. Brigadier General MASON.:

Bill, believing that flot to have such -a iaw

States. It wNould be ex..ceedingly difficuit to
do business. Looking e'ver -the Bill, however, I find tbat section 3 provides;
This Act shall be in force during the present

the Governor ini Council.

Section 5 prevides:
The Board of Railway Cormissioners for

railways,
In,
Canada for such period as may be prescribed
by the said Board, and to make such orders as
rnay be necessary for the convenient carrying
out of the provisions of this Act in so far as
railway conipanies mnay be affected thereby.

The question would naturally arise: which
would have superior power, the Governer
in Council or the Board of Railway Cernmissioners? Perlhaps tbat point might be
expl.ained. The Gevernor in Council prescribes the period for the enforcement of
the Act, and apparently the Rail,,way Board
rnay alter that.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEE.D:
They
-will have regard to whatever Order in
Council may be passed.
Hon. V. RATZ: Hénourabie gentlemen,
this Bill may have its good peints, I suppose, as my honourable friend has just said;
but I have been spea2king to a good many
farmers in my section of the country, and
aimost ail of them appear to be opposed Vo
the principle of it. I have just glanced
over the Bill, and I do not see that there
is any penalty if its provisions are not carried eut-if any one chooses Vo Ileava the
tixne as it is now. But the argument which

APRIL 10, 1,918
bas been advanced to nme by some of theý
fanmera is that during the sumimer months
they are not accustorned to go out to the
fields and do very rnuch work before 8 or
8.30 or sornetimes 9 o'clock, on account of
the dew-that their hired man may say:
I amn ready, and I arn going to start to
work at 7 o'clock, and quit at 6. " What is
to be done? The farmers want to lcnow
whether they cau say to the man: ««Ve1l,
we cannot do anything in the rnorning until
8 o'clock; and we do flot want you to work
more than ten hours.-" They want to know
if they can compel the hired man te do that.
They are afraid that they are going to have
trouble, and Borne of them think that
perhaps they will be liable to a penalty.
even though they have macle an agreement
with their man to work ten hours a day
cernrencing at a later tirne. I shouild like
te know whether they are or flot.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May 1
say, for the information of my honourable
friend, and al-so for the purpose of rernoving
any apprehiensions which he may have as to
the attitude of the farming comrnunity on
the subject, that at a large representative
gathering of western fanmers held in
Saskatchewan, at which tho&e present
included reeves and representatives of
municipalities, the question of daylight
saving came up, and a resolution was passed
favouring&the Bill.
Hon. Mr. RATZ: They have no dew out
there.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON:
Thene is no
penalty clause attached to the Bill.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 'No.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: 1 favour this Bulil in
view of the fact that it will not necessarily
be enforced for more than one year. A yean
froni now we shallknow more about it than
we do at present. To rmy mind, there is
possibly one weak spot in the Bill: iii
touches only one class-the wives of
labouring men. A man who has to be out
at work at 7 o'clock in the morning now has
to have his breakfast at 6 o'clock, and his
wif e has to be up at five o'clock in orden
to prepare it for hiu. If the tume is
advanced, this may be a very serious thing
for hier, unless she is given an hour in the
evening.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: She will go to
bed an hour earlier.
Hou. Mr. ROSS: What I amn told, and
what I have been led to understand froin

77

the letters wnitten by the wives of labouring
men to the newspapers, is that they have
no rest util the children go to bed, and
the children cannot be put to bed in daylight; 'therefore the women 'will flot get
that hour. The Bill may work eut ahi
right, but if we were as-ked to vote it in
perpetuity, 1 would vote againet it. As I
have already said, if it ie to be eff ective
for only a year, I arn in favoun of giving
it a fair trial.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOOX: The honourable
gentleman says -the Bihl will onhy be effective for a year; but if we pase the Bill,
ft je put on the Statute book and stay-s
thene until it je repeahed. Whether this
measure rwill rernain ini force for more than
a year ie a question which ie in the bande
of the Governor in Coiueil. The hionourable gentleman rwould have to apply to the
Governor in Council to rnake a regulation
each year to suit him. 0f course, at the
present tume we are accuetomed to having
things clone by Order in Cotuncil.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: Wilh the bonourable
gentleman read section 3 of the Bill P
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Section 3 only applies to the present ye-ar.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: It says the Act shall
oniy be in force during the present yean.
Hon. Mn. BOSTOCK: It Baye :
This Act shali be lni force during the present

the Governor in Council.
That refers to the present year, but of
course it can be put in force by the Govennor iu 'Counicil in anothen year. It la hait
in his banda. But, as 1 said before, we
are norw accustorned to legielation by Order
in Council, so we understand the situation.»

DEPARTMENT 0F IMMIGRATION AND
COLONISATION BILL.
SEIOOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LdOUGHEED moved the
second reading of Bihl il, an Act respectiug
the Department cf -Immigration and Colonisation. He said: Honourable gentleman,
the object of thie Bill is te empower the
Government toi eetablieh a Department of
Immigration and Colonization.
I need
scarcehy point out the importance te Canada,
particularly at the present tume, cf concentnating its attention upon this very im-

78

SENATE

portant subject,* more particularly in view
of the hoped for termination of the war at
a comparatively early date. It is well
known that a very large tide of immigration
will eweep into thjs country-at least, it
is so expected-and furthermore, it is desirable that every effort shouki be put
forth to colonise the immense areas of land
which we -have not enly in the western provinces -but in other sections of the Dominion.
Thi.s particular branch of the public
service bas been £or years atta-ched to the
Departanent of the Interior. I need not
point -out to yen that that department is
one of the largôst in the publie service.
It is charged with responsibilities probaibly
far beyond what it is able efficiently te
administer; iA is therefore very desirable
that this subject should be handled. by a
separate departmnent, inasmuch as its importance fully warrants it.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honouraible
gentlemen, the leader of the Government
ham not given us -any very lucid explanation of this Bill. It would seem to any
one wiho has studied the situation that
this departiment is flot so very urgently
needed at the present time. Immigration
work in <this country has ibeen carried on
by the Departmnent of t.he In4erdor for a
great xnany years. That department bas
had Kither brianches connected with it; but,
as I understand the situation, at tihe present time the work of the departmient is decreasing rather than increasing, and as
long -as the war continues I do not suppose
that we can look ferward 'to -a greaÀt deal of
immigration into this country. Moreover,
at the present time the werk of handling
the lands of the Dominion is getting less
ither .than more, as the Goverrament dlisposes of 'the îands in the West, where it
.h.as probably the largest extent of lanid to
deal with. In consequence of this the Interior Department should necessarily have
les.s work to do in the future than it has
at tihe present time. For the reasons I have
stated, it does not seem to 'be a reasonable
move on the part of the Govern.ment to
create 'this Department of Immigration.
Possibly urider Bill Ne. 2, which we have
already discussed this afternoon, dealing
with the rearrangement of departments, the
Goverrnnent may consider it necessary to
make a change which will better organize
the wo*rk of the departments.
The motion 'wwa agreed, te, and the Bill
was read the second tisne.

MONTREAL HARBOUR ADVANCES BILL.
SE)COND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGIIEED moved
the second reading of Bill 15, an Act to
amend the Montreal Harbour .Advances
Act, 1914. He said: Ho-nourable gentlemen,
the ohject of this Bill is te empower the
Montreal Harbour Commission to pay off
debentu.res snaturdng- during the present
year, amounting- in ail te $300,000. It -is
necessary tHiat there should be statutory
authority to do tihis. The Harbour Commission is in posession. of «unds for the
purpose of carrying tis out.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bull

DOMINION FOREST RESERVES AND~
PARKS BILL.
SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES *LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of Bill 17, an Act te amend
the Dominion« Forests Reserves and Parks
Act. He said: Honourable gentlemen, wvhen
the Statute known sa Ithe Dominion Forest
Reserves and Parks .Act was* passed, it
prevented any alienation by the Cro'wn of
the lands so reserved. It would appear
that previous to the carving out of those
reserves certain roads had been surv-eyed
or established through the land which is
now forest reserves, and by statute those
roads became vested in the province in
which they lie. In many cases lt bas been
found that owing to, the peculiar configu-.
ration of the land the particular sites selected for those -roads, which were established, cannet be, improved to such an
extent as to make themn useful. The object
of this Bill is to give authority te the
Government te lay out new roads ýý- supercede existing rends, and te accept fromn the
provincial authorities a transfer of land
which is now vested in them. The effect
will not be to lessen the area of the land
reserved, inasmuch as roads which will
hereafter be laid eut will be substitued for
th~e present ones.
The second section of the Bill malies
provision te authorise grants of minerals.
in the reserves in the province of British
Columbia. I think cthat the question was
adjudicated upon in 1890, and it was 'determined by the Privy Counicil that in . the
railway belt, and in fact in an1v Dn~i
lands in British Columbia, the precdous
metals were vested in the Crown as represented by the province, and the base metals
in the Crown as represented by the Dominion. An agreement was accordingly ente.red

APRIL 10, i11
into at thait tîme between the Government
of British ýColumbia and the Federal Governmentthat mining lands in the railway beit,
and aise lands where mines were being
operat-ed, would be administered by -the
provincial government; but in establishing
those ferest reserves, as I have already
pointed eut, authority was not given te the
Crewn to alienate, any of the lands, and
it wiii become necessary te alienate to the
miner the surface rights that may be inveived in the claims which'hemay have taken
up and to which he will be entitled. This
Bill therefere empowers the (Crown te
alienate te him *,hose surface rights te
which he would be ent4'tled under the
regulatien, and will permit of effeet being
given te, the agreement entered inte betweeu
the Gevernment cf British -Celumbia and
the Federal Government.
Hen. Mr. BOSTOCK: I notice that the
clause in this Bill with regard te British
Celumbia applies enly te the question cf
forest reserves. Can my hencurable friend
tell me what the positien would be in the
case of Dominion parks? Is ail mining
precluded in Dominion parks?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUtGMjED: I understand thait, when we established the ferest
reserves, we expressly precluded by statute the making cf grants by the mînister;
that is 4e say, none of -the lands in the
ferest reserves could be alienated. This
autherity wiil permit cf the agreement
between -the two Governments being carried
eut. It dees not apply to parks.
The motien was agreed 40o, an'd the Bill
was read the second time.

Railway Act.-Hon. Sir James Lougheed.
Hion. Mr. Girroir in the Chair.
On section 219-arbitrators:Hon. -Sir JAMES LOUGHEéED: When the
committee rose yesterday we had reached
section 219 and iwere dis.cussing certain
amendme'nts which had been moved. 1 intimated that we would accept those amendments, inasmuch as they were approved last
session by the Senate ccmmittee, and if the
Bill had been reperted by the cemmittee te
the *Senate they weui'd undeubtediy have
been adepted by the House. Section 219
and the sections followirig deal with the
appointnient cf arbitraters. It is propesed
by an amendwnent that the arbîtrator should
be a county court or district court judge,
or a- judge cf the Superior Court, as the
case may be. I 'wili accept the amendinent
to section 219.
The CHAIRMAN: Iii is proposed that
for section 219 of the Bill the follcwing be
suibstituted:
219. (1) If within ten -days after the service of such notice, or, whiere service le made
by advertieement, within one nicnth after the
first publication thereof, the opposite partY
does net give notice, tc the Company tha.t he
accepta the sumn offered by It, either party maY
apply to the judge of the county court cf the
county in whieh the lands lie, or, in the Province of Quebec or In any other part cf Canada where there is no couflty court, to a Judige
cf the superior court for the dýistrict or place
in which the lands lie, te determine the comnpensation te be paid as aforesaid.
(2) Ten deys' notice cf such application shall
be given by the ccmpany te the opposite party,
or vice versa.(3) If the opposite party Is absent from
the distritt or county In which the lands lie,
or is unknown, service cf such ten days, notice
may be mnade *by advertisement as in section
twc hundred and seventeen authcrized-:
Provlded that the judge may dispense with, shorten
or lengthen the lime or times for the publication
cf the notice in any case in whioh he deems it
proper. R.S., c. 37, s. 196; 19,07, c. 37, s9. 1.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCX: My honouraible
friend (Hen. Sir James, Lougheed) referred
yesterdiay te the question cf the judges,
and 1 nnderstocd that he was going te have
the interpretation clause amended se as te
cover the case of a district judge in Saskatchewan, where there are ne county court
judges. Does my honeurabie friend consider that thib, ainendment covers it?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED. I have
looked into the matter and find that in -1907

SENATE

the Interpretation Act was amiended to
cover the point which 1 mentioned yesterday.
Hon. Mr. BOS'TOCK: The matiter we
are now dealing with is that of having the
arbitration corne before a judge in place of
an arbitratorP
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The judge
will be the arbitrator.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK' And hie will decide
matters himself. He -wilI flot appoint.outsiders, as has been dione in the past.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOU'GHEED: No.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Therefore the arbitration, we hope, will be carried on in a
better and more satisfactory way. I think
that is a great improvement on the condition of things which. existed ýbefore, under
the old Act as 'we had it before us last session. The aribitration shou.ld be as reasonable, and carried on along the samne lines,
as the work of a court; but heretofore, unfortunately, in arbitration proceedings there
has been too much tendency to add to the
expense, which lias been a great burden
upon the country. I think we are proceeding along the right lines in dealing with
the question in this way.
The amendaient was agreed to.
On
section
220-arbitrators,
duties,
awards, procedure:
The CHAIRMAN: For section 220 of the
Bill the following is proposed to b-e 6ubstituted:
230. (1) Such judge shail, upon application
being made to him as aforesald,, beoome the
arbitrator for determining such compensation:
Provided that where such judge is personally
interested in the land or in the amount of the
compensation or damages in question, or where
for any other reason it is necessary, elther
party may, on six days' notice te the opposite
party, apply to a judge of a superior court
to appoint, and that judge nlay appoint, a
county
or
superior
court
Judge
to
be
arbitrator, and in such case the .judge so appointed shall be the arbitrator for-the purposes
aforesaid.
(,2) The arbitrator shall proceed te asoertain
auch compensaition In such way as he deemns
best, and, except as hereinafter provided,
bis
award shall be final and conclusive.
R.S., C.

The aanendment was agreed to.
On section 221 -determining
compensation:
The CHAIRMAN: It is moved that section 221 (be arnended iby substituting in
lines 10 and 29 for the word " arbitrators"
the word - arbitrator."
The amendaient was agreed to.

On section '222-.company rnay offer eusement, etc.:

The IHon. the 'CHMBRMAN.: It is proposed that at page 80 in lines 38,*39, 40 and
47, 'for the word. "arbitrators" the ýword
"'arbitrator" ho substitiuted.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Do I understand
that we are passing these sections now, as
we go along? T-here are questions other
Vhan these amendinents, to be conBidered
in connection with these sections; for instance, the question of substituting the
wor d "judge" for the word "arbitrators."
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They
are ail changes consequent upon our amendmnent of section 219. I do flot know of any
other.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The sections are
not affected in any other way?
Hon. &fr JAIMES LOU(iHEED. No; we
are adopting the sections -as they are, with
the exception of the change o! the word
"arbitrators" to "arbîtrator."
The aanendment was agreed to.
On section 216 (reconsidered)-certificate
of surveyor or engineer:

,Hon. Mr. CAISORAIIN: Would the honourable leader o! the Government agree to our
referring back to section 216? The system
adopted for arbitration will be somnewhat,
]ike that of the Exchequer Court or of
the Governiment. Instead o! having the
certificate -of one fforn land surveyor, the
principle hss always been to have certificates from two or three. Section 216 states:
Such notice shall be accompanied by the
certificate of a sworn surveyor for the province in which the lands are situated.

"A sworn surveyor." It is pex4haps a
matter to be deait with by the court. In
the Exchequer Court, for instance, or in the
case of expropriation by the Public Works
Department, or the Government, there are
two or three certificates furnished. I think
there is a better guarantee in the certificates o! two or three. The legal gentlemen
woare here representing the Governinent
-could, I think, corroborate what I say as
to the expropriation of any la.nds by the
Public Works Department or the Government. The Governxnent -appoints two or
three men to make the offer, and if it is
not aecept-ed the case goes to the Exchequer
Court.

that the judge ivoul-d travel. The judge is

The last sentence ln subsectjon 1isl new. It
reguires a conductor making a report to'thfte
Company ta notify the Board of the same by
telegram.
lit is submitted that kt ls inwroper that an
individual employee of the Company should
have imposed upan hlm the Obligation of dealing w4th the Board. That ls the duty of the
Company itself, through its superior officers,
who are responsible ta the Board and 'to the
public for the carrying out of the provisions
af the Act. No difficulty has arisen under the
preeent practice which requiýres a detailed repart to be furnished to the Board, and also
that the Board should be *Informed of the resuit of the Investigations made by the Company's offiLers and experts, and of the action
taken by the Company in consequence o! the
accident-in fact the Company's files are open
to Investigation by the Board's Inspectors and
the fullest information la obtained by thern.
It must flot be forgotten that a grave responsibilIty rests upon the managers o! railway
com-p2ries, and that tis is being honestly ald,
sincerely discharged, as the Board wlll no
doubt testi!y.
In these circumstances the
burden o! dlsclosing the causes of accidents
should. rest upon the Company itsel! rather
than uwon Individual employees wlho, if not
responsible for the occurrence, are almost of
neoesuity bound ta be lmplicated personally In
It.

That was the objection taken by the railway campanies ta that section, and when
the cammittee rose it had not,--I think,

by the court that sucb or sncb a service

think the objection je well taken.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 1 wbuld

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: But the honourable
gentleman wil] sec that tbe wording je not
the same as in the other section to whieh
1 objected, and as to which the honourable
gentleman pointedI out that it was merely
subject to regniation by the Board. Under
this section it is incnbent upon the company to furnish sncbh other service incidentai ito transportation as-is customary
or nsual in cannection with the business of
a -railway company. So it opens the door
to anybodyHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Suppose
we make the -provision: " As may be ordered

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Âdd et the end of

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: "As may'

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Yes.
The CHMIRMAN: It ia proposed that subsection 1 of section 312 be an:ended by
adding at the end thereof the words, "as
may be ordered by the Board."
The amenciment was ageed to, and section 312, as arnended, was agreed ta.
On section 302-running of trains:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would tli
honourable leader of the Government sllow
me to refer back to section 302? 1 notice
that a clause which was insertel in the
Bill as it carne from the House of Cornmons bas been dropped aind dos flot appear
in t.his sect'on. The clause ie, I think.
a very fair one. I would ask the honourable
leader of the Government why it ha flot
Aeen incl-uded in the Bull. It concerna =ny
province. There 'wae in section 30M a third
subseoticin, which reade thus:
(3) .After the firut day of January, one
thousand ainie bundred and nineiteen, the Board
may frorn time to ie make auch ordfrs and
regulations as It may deeni advlsable to provide that ail or amy railway employees on local

85

passenger trains runnlng in the province of
Quebec shall be conversant with the English
and French languages.

The Senate comniittee amended this 'by
adding alter the words "alter the first dayof January. one thoneand nin3 hundred
and nineteen, the Board May," the foh.iowing word.:
"1after hearing on such notice and ta such
persone as the Boâýrd may deternilne."

There are iiundreds of mnnicipalitis in
the province ot Quebec 'where not a Word Of
English. jes spoken, foe the simple reason
that there are no Enagli.sh eettiers in those
municipeiitisa, and obviouely a large proportion of the inhabitants oct the Province
speak only their owu lànguage, *Frenchi.
The House of Cosnmons and the oomanittes
considered it wae only f air te the province
of Qneýbec that the law ehonld previde th-at

Hon.. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am n fornied that representations were Made to

af railway sauployece that the adopting oit
that subsection wonld operate eeriously.
against the promotion of senior employece
and possibly interfere with -the retention
of those employees in, the -service of the
railway. It was thonght that it 'would be
a very grave inj ustice te themn; consequently
it was, left out. But I shaîl be very glad to
make further inqniries as to the partienlar
representations which have been made ta
the Railway Departenent or ta tihe Board,and comrnunicate thern afterwerxds ta my
honenrable friend. I would euggest thaît in
the meantime the section sho'uld stand.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes. I would
cali .My honourable friend's -attention ta
the- f act that though some employes ighit
tihereby be inconvenienced, the Tailways
and their emiployees are in the service of
the public, and the public must first be
served. It bas happened in rny presence
that passeingers coùld not carry on a conversatàon, with the railway employee because
he did not understand a word. of French.
A third persan, might intervene, as I -ddd
once, and explain the inquiry-perhaps an
important inqniry--of the passenger. Due
regard should, it seeme te me, be paid ito
the conditions in msy province, where the
twa ls.ngnages are legal.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I would appreciate
the objection inentioned by the honouraýble
leader of the Govern.ment (Han. Sir James
Lougheed) if the mâtter had not been left
to be determined by the Board after ihearing the parties. That would surely prevent
any injustice being done to railway employees. The Board would see that ýsuoh
em.ployees were transferred to other railways. or to other sections of the raii-way.
As the honourable-gentieman fromn De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) has stated,
it is really a very serious thing ihat on mailway trains running through asections of the
country where the people do flot understand the English i&anguage, passerigers oarinoV make themselves understood by the
condàctor on the train.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: -We wil
let that stand until the next sitting of tihe

Section 302 stands.
Sections 314 to 324, inclusive, were agreed

On section 325'ý-disallowance,:
-Hon., Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I desire
to add a subsectîon, which will be subsection 5, a.s follows:
The powers granted to the Board by this
section shali flot be restricted or limited by the
provisions of any specia] Act heretofore ena;cted,
or of any agreement heretofore or ihereatter
made.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I would ask the
honourable gentleman to let this etand.
To carry it, I think, would be repealing
valuabl-e acquired rights.
-Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGIIEED: I move
thie amendment, and we will take it up at
the next sitting. We can pass the section
with the exception of the amendment.
-Hon. Mr. WATSON: Will the honourable
minister consider this question and reply
to it; what effect will this section have on
the spe-cial rate between the province of
Manitoba and the Canadian Nort.hern railway? Would the Board be permitted Vo
deprive the province of the rightê secured
under that agreement after they had given
substantial aid?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think
the Tecent increase in rates gave effect to
the powets of the Board, notwithst-anding
the ag-reemenit between the railwsy and Vhe
province.

by Order in Council, as a war measure.

Hon. Sir JAIMES LOUGIiEED: If te

of tho Board, -and if it cari be shown, as iA

Hon. Mr. WATSON: 1 thînk the province
of Manitoba produced sufficient evidence
'to show that the portions of the railroad
operating ini Manitoba did pay, and that the.
increase was neces.sitated by reason of unprofitable portions of the road in easterii
Canada.

For instance,

friend'6 contention 1jolds good, evtery railroad could say: "We protest against this

withthe rights given to us by Parliament."
Notwithstanding rights which mnay be

from this general legoi&lation thie, that and
the other railway, 'who inay elaim that they,

can readily ses that it would be impoesible
to have a Railway Act and to efilorce it.

The ýRailway
Board simply replaeed the Raiiway Cernmittee of the Privy Ceuncil.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, they
have extraordinary powers.
. Ho-n. M(r. BEIQUE: The first subsection
is very broad. It says:
The Board mnay disallow any tariff or any
portion thereof which It considers to be 'uniust
or unreasonable, or contrary to any of the
provisions of thls Act and. mnay require the

company. wit.hin a prescribed time, to substitute

a tariff satisfaotory to the Board in lieu tftereof.
or mnay presoribe other tolls in lieu of the toits

s0 disallowed.

.87

Such legisiation is -aIways subject, to_ the
power of Parliament to change the charter
of any company that it bas incorporat-ed.
But that is a very different thing from'interfering with agreements made between
private parties or between a company and
,a governinent.
Surely agreements mnade
by governments should flot be' interfered
with any more -than agreements between
private parties. Here, *without any notice
at ail, is a&
very important amendment
sprung upon Parliament. It ie done without notice to the companies, or thé municipalities, or the provinces which may be
serious]y affected. because they 'wiil be deprived of vested rights. Suppose a railway company, under a special agreement
with a governnient buiids a railway and
spends a large amount of mon.ey, relying
upon the terme of the -ogreerent, and a
law is passed rwhereby the agreement is set
aside-the publie reoeiving the benefit of
the raiiway that has been built on the
faith of advantages to be derived from the
a4greement,-what then? I have -sat in thie
Parliament for six-teen years, and until
to-d-ay have flot seen an amendaient of
such a nature as that suggested by the
Government.

This provision affecte all railway 'conpanies, and as the qu.aae6ted amendaient
goes, further than that, it seems to me that
there must Ïbe some speicial object in view,
and that is what I should, like to know.

Hon. Mr. WATSON: I arn objecting i
thie este cf a specific agreement between
the province of Manitoba and the Canadian Northern rail-way. This question was
eeriously argued before the Railway Board,
and 1 say that it is an injustice to the province of Manitoba ta pasae euch legisiation.
The province of Manitoba entered into an
agreement with the railway company, that
in con.sideration cd giving certain aid they
were to get certain rig(hts for ail time. Now,
you are em.powering the Board to take away
those rights. That is a specific case, and 1
fear that this amendment is to be inserted
at this late date to give the Board full
power to interfere with that agreement. I
thi.nk the province of Manitoba s'hould be

JUDGE.

Befo-re the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I desire,
if possible, te accelerate tihe pass.ge of Bill
27, an Act to amend the Supreme Court Act,
which is on the Order Paper for the second
reading to..morrow. I thin-< we rnight take
it up to-day wàth a view to, its receiving
the assent of the Deputy Governor to-mnorrow. The Suprenie Court has net been able
to sit for sorne thne past, frion a lack of.
the necessary num.her of judges te îhear
cases. Owing to the daet that Hon. Justice
Duif has been giving bis t4rne exclusively
Vo the administration of the Military Service Act, and owing Vo the preearicus condition o! health of two of the o>ther judges,
the court lias been so. seriously handiioapped
as not to be able to hear cases, notwithstanding the -fact that maxiy counsel have
been in the city waiting Ite be heard. For
the .purpose of remedying the preserit iaituetion, the Govern.ment bias brought in the
Bill now referred to, which provides for the
appodntnîent -of an ad 'hoc judge; that is,
to permit of a judge of ainother court being
transfe-rred to take the place of any judge

PS

of the Supreine Court who may be absent.
The Suprerne Court is adjourned until Monday next. Tihere is a very long ]dist, of
cases to be heard-some twenty-five, I
th-ink-and I undert-and th-at counsel &rom
ail parts of the Domninion are in the city in
conne-etion with. those cases, and, il action
is not taken, very serious inconvenience
and expense will result. It is thereiore desirable thait we 'should relieve the situation.
Therefore, with tihe leave of the House,
I inove that the second Order oi the Day
for to-morrow, for the second reading of
Bill 27, an Act to amend the Supreme Court
Act, be now taken Up.
Hon. 'Mr. BOSTOCK: I do not thi-nk there
is any objection by any member of tihis
House tco this Bill; in fact, I think honourabYle gentlemen -would desire to assist the
Goverinent so far as possible in forwarding the 'business of the country; but, unfortuuately, this Bill was placed on the
Order Paper for a second reading to-morrow, and it às rather difficult tor make the
desired alteration without coining into conflict with the rules of the Rouse. Would it
not be possible to take the Bill up to-inorrow? We could mneet a hall an hour earier
if necessary. One honourable gentleman
told me that be had some remerks te make
abouit this Ilili and %hat,not knowing that
it would be mentioned to-day, he was not
prepared te go en.
Hon. Mr. POWER: We thave a rule o! the
Seniate which. prevents the reconsideration
or the resoinding of a resolution whdch bas
aliready been passed. I agree with the honouriable gentleman to my right (Hon. Mr.
Bostiock) in thiriking that t>he better way
would he te ]et the meatter stand, -with the
understanding, 'which I think the 'who]e
House is willing to corne to, that the Bill
mey -be .read a third time to-morrow, inmediately aiter tihe second reading. If that
is done, we will flot violate the rules of the
House, 'but we w,.i.'ll ettain the object which
is desired. I understand that there will be
ne opposilon te the mneasure. The honourable leader of the nouse can give notice
Vo-day to suspend the rule se that tihe Bill
may be read the third time to-morrow, -and
in that 'way we shall be just -as far ahead.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND. 0f course, by
leave of the Hou.se, everybody closing his
eyes te, the rule, we could proceed on the
line.s suggested by the leader of the Gevernment; but it is siol a dangerous preceden't that it seems to me that my bonourable friend could well accept the offer
made on this side of the House to pass the

SENATE

Bill to-morrow so that it m.ay be as-sented
to during the afternoon.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I quite
appreciate the fact thast what I propose
can only be donc by leave of the House,
and, in view of tihe suggestion which honourable gentlemen have made, I shall let
the matter stand until to-morrow. In the
meantime I move &hat the Bill be the first
Order of the Day to-morrow, and will give
notice of a motion te suspend the rules so
that the Bill may be put .through the committee stage and read the third time tomrrow. I do not think it will be necessary
to meet at half-past two.

PUBLIC SERVICE REARRANGEMENTS
BILL.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE
REPORTED.

AND

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed the
Senate went into comnittee on Bill 2, an
Act to authorize Rearrangements and Transfers of duties in the Public Service. Hon
Mr. Daniel in the Ohair.
On section 1-transfers from one minister
to another, and frcm one department to
another:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Can the honourable
the leader of the Government tell us whether any decision has been corne to as to
the rearrangement of departments?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Nothing
definitely yet. The removal of the Copyright Branch from the Department of Agriculture and the amalgamation of the Inland
Revenue Department with the Customs Department have been suggested, but up to
the present time nothing has been done.
I am not prepared to say what the Government will do.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: At the present time
the Post Office Department is without a
head. The Postmaster General has been
absent for a long time-one honourable gentleman here says that he has resigned. I
was not aware of that; I thought he still
occupied his position; but for a long time
the department bas been under the administration of an acting minister. Can the
leader of the Government give us any information with regard to that?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am not
aware that the minister tas resigned; I
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

have not as yet been apprised of his resignation, and, inasmuch as he is engaged in
the defence of his country at the present
time, it would be undesirable to take anv
action.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: The present Postmaster General bas no seat in the lower
House, I und.erstand. Does the Government intend to retain indefinitely a minister who bas not the confidence of the
people?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Not indefinitely.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: Mr. Blondin has been
defeated-very seriously.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: He lost his deposit.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: That is a bagatelle.
I think the country is entitled to a little
information on this point. It is one that
affects the democratic service of the country. Why should the Government foist at
the bead of an important department, such
as the Post Office is, a man who tas lost
the confidence of the electorate of the country? There is no necessity for him to
resign; he has been beaten. I think that
asking for this information is not opposition
to a Government war measùre; it is simply
asking the Government to deal fairly,
honest-ly and openly vith the efectoratethat is all. I quite approve of paragraph
b, which authorizes the Government to
amalgamate two or more departments into
one. That is an evidence of their intention
to be economical in the future. Economy
bas not been practised up to the present in
regard to departinents, because the Government have been splitting single departments
into two or three. How far they will go
with regard to the others I do not know,
but certainly Parliament can have no objection to the Government putting as many
departnents as possible under one head.
That is a wise clause. To corne back to the
point in regard to the Postmaster General,
who is no longer at the head of the depaMment, how long is the Government going
to retain th.at position vacant awaiting for
the so-called resignation? No resignation
is necessary. I think the Government owe
an explanation of their attitude in this
matter. It is only fair and honest, and the
people want to know.

If 'the Bill were ta pass as it ié. the effect

I would suggest that section 3 be replaced
by the following wording:

This wording would g-ive ta, the Government ail the latitude possible ta see whether

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would like
te, examine thîs Bill as, it às baera us, net
as it was introduced into the House cf
Gommons. As it is befere us, there is ne
doubt that it is te ha applied this year and
following years. This is 'what iL saysDuringthe preecri-bad perlod In each yaar In

Undoubtedly lihis section was ineant te

cornplicated. Nevertheless, it la, qu-ite clear
-thât, before it ean go into .effect, the Gevernor in Council inust say when it is to haecorne effective and when it is to cease to

but the lawyers have it fixed up so that no0
person can understand it. That is the resuit
of their aducattion, and they cannot help it.
Hcm. Mr. WATSON: I think it would be

the resuits carefully. There is ne doubt
that the Bill goas into force by order of the

the United States has adopted this advanced time it would ba a mistake for Canada te do se, because -the m ost important
thing that we have to, consider, ziait te
getting mien te the -front, às the getting of
men for production, and I think this measure will ba detrirnental in that respect. I
sea my honourable friand who represents
labour (Hon. Mr. Robertson) ehaking bis
head. It is ail right se far as the mechanic
is concerned-the boys will ha table te, geL
out and play basebail before dark; but -the
farmer is ini a different position. We al
know that farming opertations cannot ha
undertaken when there is dew on the
ground, and thiat the bast hour cf the day
-between five aild six o'cieck in the alternoon-will be cuL off by reasen of thùs Bill.
Farm labour i-s so scarce at the-present
time thet tarin hands can practically fix
the heurs during whioh they wiiii work. In
Mianitoba farmers are paying -as high as
$75 a znonth for heip, and 'when labourers

and I arn satisfie-d tb.at in the vicin.ity cf

at the saine tirne that the boys quit in the

SENATE
Hon. Mr. WATSON:
My honourable
friend says that we are.looking- to Washington. I do nlot object te that;,but 1 think
the Governn]ent should give close attention to the working of this Bill this ye.ar,
and if it works to the detriment of the
farmer and te the detriment of the production of cereals and food*stuffs, we should
go back to6 the old time. There is another
thingý to be considered. Ta1ke the case of
the workingman who wants to re.st. Every
one knows that pro-bably the best hours
for resting are in the -col of the morning,
neot the hot hours of the evening; but
under this Bill a mnan h.as to rise e.arlier
in -the morning. It is claimed that this
chang-e of timie will increase the production
of garden plots; but people do nlot do garden work -in the evening; it is done in, the
morning. Children will have te rise earlier.
As we ail know, it ih difficuit to -et themn
te go te bed hefore it is dark, and they will
nlot get as 'much sleep under the proposed
systei as -they do at the present time. As
I have said, if it were flot for the tact that
the United States have moved the dlock
ahlead an hour, I would oppose thé Bill.
Hon. Mr. RICHARDSON- I have always
understood that in the North-west in the
winter tirne the weather was se dry that
people did not, feel the cold. This is an
emergency measure intended to increase
production. We ail know that we are going
to pass it. I agree with the lhonourable
gentleman fromn Halifax (Hon. Mr. Crosby)
that this House somnetirnes strains at gnats
and swallows camels. This is a war measure and we are going te pass it. Let us go
ahead and do it.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: The remark made
by the honourable gentleman fromn Middleton (Hon W. B. Ross) should not be lost
sight of. This Bill passed the House of
Comnnions on a certain understanding-. There
is no dou'bt that there was considerable
opposition to it in that House; but if was

catrned and set aside by the understanding
that the Bill was to. be effective for only
one year. As 1 understand, the minister
whlo %vas responsible 'for the Bill said that
in the future they would be 'able to speak

of -it in the light et the experience gained;
theretore one would gather that this Bill
would net be a permanent measure. If we
m-ake it a permanent measure we will be

this Bill. If it is sinrply te go into effeot
for one vear, it will pass this House 'by a
unanimous vote; but if we -are told that it
is te be a permanent measure, and is to
rernain on the statute book until if is repe.aled. tien there may be so4me opposition te if; the honourable geitleinan next te
the leader of the Goverrent <Hon. W. B.
Rloss) is prepared to vote against it, and
1 probably would do likewise. If it is
siiply a temporary ineasure of expediency,

1 think that the Goveramnent sheuld say
so. It should be able te state what the intention is, more especially in view of the
fact that the legal talent on both sides ot
the House is d-ivided in reg-ard te the interpretatien ot it. I agree with the honourable gentleman fromn Halifax (Hon. Mr.
Crosby) that there are too miany lawyers
engag-ed in drafting Bills. They do not get
down te good. comm;on sense and .far-sighted
Iaw. They do net nake laws se clear that
thev can be read while running.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Is the honourable
gentleman speaking for himiself?
Hpon. Mr. CLORAN: Yes, I arn speaking
for myselt. I think I have a fairly -level
heacl, although I i a lawyer. I do not
allow iny legal training te kinock the cotemon sense ouf of mie. If the legal talent
is divided in opinion, what then? If the
honourable gentlemankti froin de Salaberry
(Hon. Mr. Béique) is appointed te the
Bench, he will decide that it is a permanent measure. If the honourable gentleman
from Middleton (Hon. W. B. Ross) is appeinted te the Bench, he will decide otherwise. Therefore I say the business of Pariiainent, especially uf the Senate, where we
are calrn and where there is no partisanship exhibifed, ýis te make the l.aws açi
clear as peesible. If I were drafting t.his
Bill I would make if clear by adding one
word in either section 2 or section 3. The
Bill Eays "during

However, it is for the honourable leader
of the 'Goveruiment to tell the House -what

the honourable gentleman fromn Middleton

Hon. -Mr. POWERl: If the honourable

I ishould like to say a word or two on the
subject. The honourable gentleman froin
Portage la Prairie (Hon. Mr. Watson)
thouguht it desirable that there should be
a discussion of the merits of the Bill. I
regret to say that I cannot at this stage
agree with the honourable gentleman. The
inerits of the Bill \vere discussed in another
place at considerable leng-th, and it was
found that there 'vas a very mnarked difference of opinion amiong the representatives
of different classes of the commiunity and
of different portions of tAie country. The
resuit wvas that this Bill, which had been
intended, as I understand. to be a permanent measure, wus altered, and the

Hon. Mr. WATSON: Proud to say it.
Hon. Mr. POWER: We are in comiùittee
for the purpose of amending the Bill. The
probability is that after the Government
hed decided that the Act was to operate for
only one year, the legal gentleman to whomn
the Bill was referred for amendment, so sa
to carry ont the intention, did not observe
these words "in each year" in the second
section. If these words are left in and the.
Bill becomnes law, serieus questions inay
arise, in Court or edsewhe.re. in respect
to the meaning of the Act. I think that
instead of spendinig much more time over
this the committee had better remove the
doubt. I move that in the first lineThe CHAIRMAN: Before the honourable
gentleman puts his motion, I have another
motion, which xvas handed to me, and I
would deal with it first.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I am willing to withdraw my motion if section 2 is to be reconsidered.
Hon. Mr. POWERl: Section 2 has not
been passed yet, as I understand. My
motion is that the words "in each year" in
the first line of section 2 be strieken out.
In section 3 it is provided that the period
in which the Act is to be in force may be
prescribed only for "the present year." I
hope the honourable leader of the Governmient sees no objection to my amnendînent.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON: I do not think
it is very difficult to understand the Bill
as it is. Section 2 says: - During the pre..
scribed peniod in each vear ln Nwhich this
Act is in force." There iý nothing in setion
2 providing that a period niay he prescribed
by the Governor in Council. This law will
not go any further than the present year.
H-on. W. B. ROSS. There is no doubt
about that.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON: The-whole Bill
oxplains itself. The law can be enforced
anir during a prescnibed period in eaciî
year, but section 3 provides only that a
peniod may bie prescribed for the present
year; it does not provide for prescribing
a period for next year. The Act can apply
only to the present year.

in the House of ('ommons; it was very
logically drafted; it was as clear as dayhight.
Hon. Mr. WVATSOlN: kt is a daylight Bill.
Ilon. Mr. DANDURAND: As .presented in
the House of Commons, the Bill contained
these two short clauses. Section 2:
During -the prescribed period in each year
in which thie Act Ia in force, the Urine, ftor
generai purposes in Oanada. shail be one hour
in advance of the solar mean Urne.
That w~as ail. You see, the words were,
as tbey are here, -during the prescribed
,period in each year." The Bill was meant
to be perniinent. Clause 3 read:
This Act ahail ba in force In each year during
such Urne as may -be prescribed by the Goveror in Council.
That was clear-cut and was perfect drafting. The Act was meant to be applied from
year to year. Unfortunately. section 2 is
'eft, as it was crigi.nally intended, for continnous operation, but section 3 has been
amended in order that the Act may apply
sirnply for this year. There is no doubt
that %vere it not for the question of time
which my honourable friend (Hon. Sir
James .Loug-heed) may have in mind just
now, and the fAct that he desires to 'have
tbis Act sanctioned to-morrow, he himself
would inove to strike out the three words,
"in cach year," in order that section 2
iri.gýht agree with section 3.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No. My
honourable friend did not appreciate what
I said. In contemplation of this Act being
a continuing measure, if we continue it by
&tatute next year, it is desirable to have
this wording.
According to
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
what my honourable friend sa"m, it will relieve us from the obligation of elaborating
another Bill next year te leave thir. one, as
it is. In the nieantiine, I 'would draw my
honouraible friend'-s attention to this fact,
that any person outside of Canada reading
this Act rwill think it very confusing, and
we ourselves éhail not have reason to feel
very proud of having this Act appear in our
statutes.

REVISED EDITION

SENATE
There seeins ta be a general feeling among
the members who have spoken, that farmer6
will work such hours as suit them. Thsst
may be true of the individual farmer who is

operating- his own farm, or who has perhaps
onily one man warking witùh him; 6uch
farmers will work the hours they find .most
advantageous; but there are many persons
in this country who are farmiing in what
might be called a -wholesale way, who find
it necessary to einploy a large number of
farmn labourers, uand when they go inta the
labour market they have to compete wi-th
mill-owners or men operating munition
factories, to secure the neoessary labour,
particularly at harvest time. We find that
men, at least those who are at ail adjacent
to cities, towns or large villag-es, desire to
be given permission to quit work at 6
o'clock. Therefore the hour of the day
which is perhaps the niost valuable will be
lost to agaricultural production. I arn speakin-, from practical experience. 1 have for
sever-al years employed a large number of
men on the farm, and, although the impression prevails that farm labourers wark ahl
honrs, my men for the last five years have
always quit at 6 o'clock; and 1 suppose
they will want to continue that and expect
To quit at 6 o'clock-. A great deal of gratuitous advice has been given to the fermers
during- the past year or so in regard to
increase of production. That has been taken
in a spirit of good-natured contempt by the
farmers. They feel that they have as much
rig-ht te advise the lawyer, or the wholesale
man, or city men in general, how to, conduct
their business, as the city men have to send
out, g-ratis, advice to the farmers in regard
to increased production. The farmers of this
country are patriotic enough to do their utmiost in increasing production. Aside from
their patriotic spirit, the prices they are at
present receiving for their, products are an
incentive for theni to produce to the limit.
1 fully agree with the honourable gentleman
fromi Portage la Prairie (Hon. Mr. Watson)
that this xvill hamper production, but ini
view of the arguments which have been advanced, I will not oppose it.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: This measure was
made to cornply vith a similar measure
which wvas passed in the United States
Concress. Il their measure is a temporary one ours will have te be a temporary
one. That settles the whole question. We
need flot dispute over it. If they finid it
advantageous to continue this system, we

The Governiment
Hon. Mr. CLORA-N:
ought to have no objection to that. Because a Bill cornes down here from a minister of the Crown is the honou-rable leader
of the Governsnent afraid to go back on
the draft? The word "only" cavers everything, especi*ally if it is the intention of
the Mintister of Trade a'nd Commerce, who
is the father of the Bill, that it should be
effective for only one year. I know that
thîs Bill was not so strongly opposed in
the Houze of Commons as it would h-ave
been if it had not b-een for that understanding. Why flot miake it clear by putting in the word "only "?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I ask the honourable
gentleman from Halifax (Hon. Mr. Power)
to take 'the staternent, -"This Act. sb.all be
in force during the present year." Is that
any indication in that it is to be -in force
next year? After ail, the honourable gentlem-an's motion simply adds words withourt accomplishing anything.
Hon. Mr. POWER:

Section 3 says:

This Act shall be in force during the present
year for such limne as mnay be preecribed by
the Governor in Council.

Well, what about othè-r vears? Go back to
section 2 and you find the words: -"During
the prescribed period in each year."
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
with a view of continuing it if it is found
desirable.

~Hon. Mr. POWER: As I unde.rstand,
it is deeirable that the Bill should be assented to at an early date. The Government should be anxious To get it through.

All necessary amiendmenies mnight have

of making a measure clear and effective.
I think the amendment proposed by the

Hon. Sir JAMES LiOUGHEED: I understand that it is intended to make it effective as quickly as possible. The United

an the ist of this month, and it would
have ibeen desirable for us to have had
similar legislation at the saine time.
Han. .Mr. BRADBURY: If it becomes

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Having had some
little experience in the railway transportation world, I think it very desirable that
the Act should came into force some time
in the early hours of Sunday marning, the
l4tb. On the railways there is always an
element of danger iii changing the time.
As an employee may forget, it is desirable
that the time should change duringy the
perîod of the day wvhen the fewest trains are
running-, thereby minîmizing the danger to
the greatest possible extent. While I do
not know whiat the Governor in Council
may have in mind in this connection, my
own view is that some time between 12 and
2 o'clock on Sunday morning would be the
proper time for this leg-isiation to become
operative.
Hon. Mr. EDWARDS: I was ixVthe United
States when their Daylighit Saviîîg Act camne

change took place early Sunday morning,
and there did nat seemn ta be a particle of
trouble about it. It seemed that everyone
wvent ta bed earlier and got up earlier without any difficulty whatever. Would it nat
be dang-erous ta -bring- this law into effect
on two days' notice? Would it flot be more
desirable ta have it came into effect a week
fronh SundayP
Hon. Mr. WVATSON: I am not a practical
railroad mi, but it appears ta me that the
suggestion made by the honourable minister (Hon. Mr. Robertson) is a very .practical one. In Canada we are supposed ta
observe the Lord's Day. There are not many
freighit trains moving on that day, in fact

all local passenger trains are taken off, and
the railroad eînployees would be the only
men affected. Any danger that might occur
would be from the eînplayees themselves, who cau be notified of the
change on very short notice. Through
trains get orders at every important
gtation. I think it would be a wise prec'autin ta inake this change on) a Sunday.
I trust that the Government will endeavour ta find aut-how the Act works this
year. If they find that it is injurious ta
thie people ai Canada generally, they should
confer with the United States Government
with the view of adopting a standard of
time. We have ta work with aur neighhours ta the south in this matter because

Hon. Mr. CLORAN: The present Parliament is one in which party spirit is largely

being airned st the existence of the Government, or the party which it represents.
This is the tume for the majority to act on
suggestions hased on fairness, on suggestions made in the interest of the public,
and not to sit behind the leader of the
Government, either in this House or in the

Government measure that is in question.
These suggestions 1 offer on behaîf of good,

not likely to have any immigration.
I have already had occasion to say that I
did not expect much irmigration from
Europe, but that whatever immigration we
received would corne mostly from the,
United States. I wou]d hardly have dared
to say s0 in 191,. because IQ the campaigp
of 1911 it was declared that there should
be no more truck or trade with the United
States. But since hearing the Speech from
the Throne, which ehows that it is at last

that we may have immigration from the

arn beginning to realize that the Post Office
Department, although an important one,
does not need the entire time of a minister.
My contact with that department gives me
that impression. Since the portfolio of
Poetmaster General is vacant-4or the
Prime Minister declared in another place
that he had received the resignation of the
late Postrnaster General, the Hon. Mr.
Blondin-this reems to be an opportune
time to try to join tiwo departments together -and avoid the creation of new departments. As I have stated, the Labour
and Post Office lepartments used to 'be together, but now it i6 quite clear th-at since
the Minister of Justice whose time is very
valuable and who hais very important fumetions to perforrn, has been able for a year
to administer the Postmaster General's Department, that department should be joined to another.

connection with food conservation, a case
in which eeonomy could have been practis-ed and might well have been practised
for the public good. As 1 say, the Governhas advised the public to be very economnical and very careful as to wvhat they eat.
The drink had been already eut off, so there
was no necessity for dealing with that. A
commission was established to keep down
the prices of food and reduce the cost of

things which had been wrongfully done.

of living have done nothing whatever, and
there has been an immense sum of money
squandered. The only good resuit lias been
that a considerable number of friends of
the Government have been provided with
comfortable situations.
Hon. Mr. WATSON- And O'Connor bas
quit the job.
Hon. Mr. POWER: Now, I just wish in
a crude, sort of way to caîl attention to this
section 3. As I say, it shows that there is
to be a large staff, including a deputy minister and probably an assistant deputy.
There is flot the slightest necessity for an
additional minister. I think the Government's attention must have been called to
the fact that in the United States, where
there is a population of 100,000,000, where
there is as large a territory to govern as
we have, and where there are a great many
interesýts toi be considered, they get along
with a cabinet of ten mem!bers. I have
not counted the number of members of the
Cabinet in Canada lately, but I think the
number must be somewhere near twenty.

Hon. Mr. POWER: The thing is absiird

look forward with a great deal of dread to
what the financial future of this country

for providing positions for a larger number
of .friends of the Government.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Speaking for

this measure 'before us, for it strikes me

the Chair.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-to authorize grant of minerais in foreet reserves to province of British
Columbia under agreement of February,
1890:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK. Under this section
the title to the surface right je under lease,
je it not? The title to the surface righit je
not granted with the minerais. The miner
gets the titie to the minerais from the province, but hie gets from the Dominion Governmerit only a lease of the surface right.
He cannot -et a Crown grant.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am unaware whether under the present m4ining
regulations a mining right je granted by
lease or by grant, but in either case it
wouid be neceseary to secure the authority
which we ask for in this section, owing to
the prior legislation which was passed preventing the Crown, through the Federal Gov-

ernment, from alienating any land in the
forest reserves.

The CHAIRMAN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I do not see where
the deficiency cornes in.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: It je the difference between the amount produced by the
sale of the goods and the amount due for
freig-ht.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If the goods
are not claimed b-ut are sold for the
charges, and if they produce an insuficient
amount to pay the freight, the difference
can be cIaîxned.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The question arese in my mnd. yesterday whether
the ainendanent was necessary. Freight ie

company and the ahipper; conEequentlýy if
there is -a deficiency the railway company
can sue upon that contract in any court of

that the amendment je unnecessary. What
I have stated is a principle of law that is
recognized and eannot be disputed &for a

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I arn not prepared to eay that the honourable leader of

Hon. Mr. POWER: I have a dim recollection that there 'vas quite a fight in the

APRIL il, 1918
Cornrnttee on Railways over that section
last year.
There was
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
quite a discussion.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I arn
inforrned that these are the general clauses
that appear in ail railway Bis. The controversy was over l.ater sections.
Hon. Mr. POWER: This is marked
"new."
Hon. Mr. EDWARDS: Railway companies
and companies of that kind have had
authority to use surplus power which they
developed in their operations, but I'think
this section goes beyond that.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:- IV is a
new clause.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Does it stand?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think
we had better dîscuss it. I arn not pressing
it to a conclusion, but we had better deal
with it as we go along, if we can do so
intelligently. 1 may ssy that sections 368,
369, 370, 371 and 372 are standard clauses
.tbat we have been inserting in ail railway
Bis. We are now incorporating them into
this Act so as to obviate hereai fer the
neoesity of specifically setting therni ont in
private Bis.
Hon. Mr. EDWARDS: I do not think
the objection which I înentioned a moment

Section 368 was agreed to.
Section 369 was agreed tc.

Hon. M-\r. DANDURAND: What are the
parts of this section which are new?
Hon. M.%r.
POWER: They are ail new.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: These sections are ail new so far as the generai Railway Act is concerned, but they are old sections in the sense of havingu been incorporated for several years past in private
railway Bills.
Hon. Mr. N.IOHOLLS: I wouid ask that
that section stand.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Would the
honourable gentleman just state reasons,
so that we rnay have them before us?
Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS: I think this section
is connected with sections 373 and 374,
which provide that, notwithstanding, any
other powers previously conferred, the Company cannot engage in any other under-

105

taking without a by-law having been previously passed by the rnunicipality.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGUEED: But this

Subsection 1 reads:

section, no lines or wires for telegraphs, telephones, or the conveyance of Ilght, heat, power
or electriclty shall be erected, placed or maintalned along or across the rail-way or across
other such Unes or wires wlthin the legislative authority of the Parliamnent of Canada, without leave -of the Board.

But in subsection 4 honouraible gentlemen
will notice:
Upon sueh order being made such Unes and
wires may be erected, placed and maintained

Should ' not the words "along or" be inserted?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUG.HEED: I do not
think those words have been left out purposelv. They were in the statute of last
year.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOeK: If the worcis -aie
usýed in subsection 1, I think they ougnt
to be used in the other subsection. Otherwise it would look as if the order were flo,
to apply Vo the telegraph poles erected alon.the railway.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I think
the words '%along or" should be there. Will
you make that change, Mr. Chairman?
The CHAIRMAN: It is moved that subsection 4 be amended by inserting between
the word "rnaintained" and the word

That
Hon. Sir JAM~ES LOUGHEED:
section was passed last session.
Hon. W. B. WILLOU(GHBY: Before
you pass that section., 1 wouid like to say
a- word or two in conneotion with it, particularly in relation ito section 278. I-f you
look at subsection 2 of the section in question, you wili find that it deals with aninals kilied or inj.ured at highway crossinges. Section 278 o! thié Bill says:
No horses, sheep, swine or other cattie shall
be permitted to be at large urpon any highway,
withln hli a mile of the Intersection of such
highway wlth any rail'way at rail level. unless
they are in charge of some competent person or
persons, to prevent their loitering or stopping
on such highway at sucli Interasectlon.

If animais are at large, and are killed
on the railway, the owners caninot recover
damages3 from the railway company. This
provision works very inequitabiy 6o far as
the farmers of -Saskatchewan are conoerned.
In that province we have recognized the
advantage to the public generally, and k>
the farmer particularly, of animais running
at large. Any municipai±y ia permitted
to pass a by-iaw aliowing animais to run
at large during the winter season. Legaislation has been passed there prohibîting
farmers or others from .storing their grain,
even on their o'wn lands, in such a way
that it might be eaten 'by animiais

conditions. I cannot speak for the other
provinces, but in Saskatchewan it is recognized as a great advantage for animais,
particularly horses, to run at large in the
winter time. 0f course, such loews as we
have in that regard wouid not appiy in the
older provinces, 'where, by reason of more
acute climatic conditions in the -winter,

purposes. Mi seems to me that this section might be amended with regard to the

homses and cattle owned by farmers are
heid under the Raii-way Act, to be at large,

because they are not in charge of any per-

son. If they were to be killed upon a railway crossing the owner wouid get no damages whatever. I dare say the honourable
leader of the -House 'wili let this section
stand. If it were necessary k> reconsider
it it should. be reconsidered in connection
with section 278. I think that where it is
iawful for animais to run at large under
the by-laws of the municipalities, made pursuant k> provincial authority, the railway
should compensate the owner for those
,animais which get killed on the railway
crossulgs, or whieh get on the. track at crossings and are killed.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I have
no objection to the section being al]o-wed to
stand, .particularly -as it is almoet six
o'clock, but I would point out that the
policy of the Act is to. protect the public,
which is a more important factor even th-an
the protection of live-stock or the payment
o! compensation to the ýùwners of live-stock.
The recovery of compensation by owners
of iive-stock is very insignificant compared
with the protection of life and property.
However, I shahl -le very giad to let the
section stand.
Section 387 stands.

In the year of Our Lord one thousand

By command.
Thomas Mulvey,
Under-Secretary of State.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, the motion is explained very fully in the proclamation. Under section 4 of the Act of 1915,
known as the Finance Act, it is provided
among- other things, that:
[n case of war, real or apprehended. and In
case of any real or apprehende-d financial crisis,
Our Governor In Council Inay, by Proclamation
published in the Canada Gazette, authorize the
several chartered banks to Issue excess circulation f rom and lncluding the first day of March
ln any year to and Including the last day of
August next ensuing, or durlng any part of
such perlod, to amounts not exceeding fitteen
per cent of the combined unimpaired capital and
rest or reserved fund of their respective banks.

This proclamation has been issued and
the thirty days will expire on Tuesday next;
consequently it is necessary under the provisions o! the Finance Act that this proclarnation should, be confirmed by Parliament.
For the information of the House I may
say that there is collected by the iGovernment of Canada five per cent on all such
excess over the unimpaired paid-up capital
and the amount of current gold coin and
Dominion notes held in the central gold
reserves. The total excess circulation 'which
has ýbeen made and which is affected by this
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

proclamation is, in round numbers, $20,000,000, or, to be exact, $ 19,825,585.
Hon. M.r. BOSTOCK: That has already
been muade?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, during this particular year.
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON: Is that the f ull
arnount that could issue-the fuli 15 per
cent?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Th.at is
the amount for this financial year, beginning March, 1917, and ending February,
1918. Orî this amounit the Govexnment has
collected $109,533.06.
Hon. Mr. MeSWEENEY: That is 5 per
cent?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, 5
per cent. I may say that every one of the
twenty-one banks in Canada has .availed
itself of the privilege during- the year, at
one time or other.
Hon. M.r. DANIEL: The honourable
leader of the Government stated, I think,
that this amount was froru the period froru
March 1, 1917, to Fdbruary, 1918.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: But the proclamation states that the time of this excess circulation shall be only froru the -"firstday,
of March in any year to and incl'uding the
last day cf August next ensuing." So if it
runs on till the first of February, it would
-be in excess of the proclamation, would it
not?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It would
in a sense, and yet again it would not. The
object of the legisiation. which was pass-ed
in 1915. is to cover the remainder of the
year, so that during the war period this
excess circulation may be made during the
whole vear. The Bank Act makes provision
Lor the issue of excess circulation durin- t.he
other period of the year; this applies to the
reanainder of the year. Thus the circulation niay proceed during the whole year
up to thýe extent of 15 per cent.
The motion was agreed to.
SUPREME COURT ACT AMENDMENT
BILL.
SECOND AND THIRD READINGS.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading od Bill 27, an Act te amend
the Supreme Court Act.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Will the honourable gentleman explain?

il

APRIL 12, 1918
1I
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
thougaht that I had fully explained this
Bill vesterday; but apparently my explanations went for naught, because the second
reading did .not proceed as 1 had intended.
This Bill is for the pu.rpose of gîÎving
authority to the Supreme Court to appoint
ad hoc judges to fill any vaoanoies which
may occur frorn time to time due to the
absence of judges. Recently Hon. Mr. Justice Duff has been giving his time exclusively to the administration of the Military Service Act, and two of the other
judg-es have been in precarious health. As
a consequence it basl been dîfficult to form
a court for the hearing- of cases; in fact,
for some tirne past the court has not been
sitting, and 1 understand that many counsel have been ln attendance bere for the
purpose of disposing of cases. Some tinie
ago, in anticipation of this Bill being
passed, the court adjourned untîl April 16,
with a view to bearing cases on that date.
Counsel are here fromn ail parts of Canada,
and are ready to proceed with those cases.
Therefore it is desirwble that we should
pass the Bill to-day, if possible, ina.much
as His Honour the Deputy Governor is
coming down to give assent Vo the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: My h<onourable
friend refers to Hon. Mr. Justice Duff as
being- eng-aged in other work, and to two
o! the other judges, as being ill. If 1 understand this Bill arigbt At provides for the
appoîntment of only one judge. Will that
provide a sufficient nuniber o! judg-es to
,carry on the work of the court? I understand that the Supreme Court is coenposed
,of six judges. If tbree are absent, only
three will be left; the addition o! one more
will make only four. If these judges are
evenly divided upon any case, it will be
placed in a rather awkward position. 1
think my honourable friend knows of a
case in which soinething of this kind occurred, and in wbich considerable difficulty
wa.s occasioned to the public as a consequence.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The Bill
permits of a quorum of ad hoc judges being
appointed.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Under the Act the
quorum is four.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes. 0f
course, that condition will sometimes occur.
I referred Vo the fact that two of the judges
are sufferingm froni impaired health, but
it does noV necessarily follow that they *ill
be eufiering- at the samne ime. It is Vo be
hoped that theý will alterniate tû such an'

extent that the court will be ablet~
on business.

o oarry

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I notice in the
Bill the words, "owing Vo a vacancy or
vacancies." I tbink that phrase wvill cover
the point.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, I
should think it would permit of the appoîntment o! more than one judge.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will my lionourable friend look at the words, "for such
suppose
period as nxay be necessary.that is a matter that is le! t to the diacretion o! the Chie! Justice.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 1 would
think so.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Suppose an ad
hoc judge were appointed wbo said, «"I arn
going to continue sitting." wyhat then?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If the
judge whose vacancy hie was filling should
reappear, I fancy hie would retire gracefully..
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
about that.

I do not knowv

The -motion was ag-reed Vo, and the Bill
was read the second time.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Will my
honourable friends permit the Bill to be
read the thîrd time without being- considered in committee?
Sonie Hon. SENATORS: Yes.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: With the
leave -o! the House, I move the third reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: May I ask my
honourable friend if the Bill bas met with
the approval of the court? Has it been
,submitted Vo tr!ie judges?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I understand so. In fact, two of the judges spoke
to nie upon the subi ect, stating that they
wvere very anxious that the Bill as passed
by the Comnions should pass this House
to-day.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is as it now
stands.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
The motion wvas agreed to, and- the Bill
was read the third time and passed.

SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of Bill 14, an Act to conflrm
an ag-reement between His Majesty the
King and the Van Buren Bridge Company.
He said: lionourable gentlemen, this
Bill is for the purpose of confirming an
agreement between the Government and
the Van Buren Bridge Company. Thc
agreement provides for a lease of a
line of railway, about two miles in
length, belong-ing to the Van Burer.
Bridge Comnpany, and extending as a link
between t1w International railway and the
Transcontinential railway in the parish of
St. Leonards, in the county of Madawaska,
in New Brunswick. The object of the
agreement is to dispense with the parallel
operation cf the two r.ailways for a distance
Under the
of approxiniately two miles.
agreement it will be possible to use one
railwayý yard at St. Leonards instead of
two. The Government is paying an annual
rentai cf $1,200 and the term of the agreement expires on August 31, 1934, the date
of maturity of the compaDy's bond issue.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOIJGHEED.

Provision is mnade for an interchange cf
traffic. The other various clauses are u.sual
and proper in such an agreement, and appear in the schedule of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. MeSWEENEY: Is it intended
to reinove the rails for the two miîles, and
te use them?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Inasmuch
as the Governmeut will have the road untîl
1934, I presumne there is ne reason why
that should net be done dif it is in the
public interest te do se.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Do~I underatand
that it is the intentien of the Geyvernment
te give up operating a part of the International railway, and te use the connection,
which I understand is made over these two
miles, te the Transcontinental?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I am net
familiar with the geography ef the locality,
but this will reduce operating expenses, as
only eue road will be operatîng. The Government will make use of the ene yard and the
one station.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Is the International
a Government railroad?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is
operated by the Government.
It is under
Hon. Mr. McSWEENEY:
le-ase.
The motion was agareed te, and the Bill
was read the second time.
SHIPBUIILDIG

IN

CANADA.

DISCUSSION.

Hon. J. S. McLENNAN rose te
Cati the attention of the Senate to the encouragemnent of a permanent shipbuilding industry in Canada and to inquire of the Governmke investigation of the
ment If they wll
effects of goveratmental aid to shippinýg in other
countries, before settling on suait a policy.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, I hope
the importance and the necessity of what
I have te say will condone my brea.king in
on the business which this House la carrying on with s4ich. unwonted celerity. . I
feel that the question is one of enormous
divides itseif into two
importance. It
general divisions ene dealing with transportation generally, and based obviously
on the principle that the freer the interchange of commodities the freer and more
ahundant bringing in of what the people of
Canada want, and the sending eut of what
the people of Canada have te dispose of te
countries overseas which. we are trading
with, eithe.r as buyers or sellers, leads te

APRIL 12, 1918
the greatest benefit to the people of this
country. Owing to the comity of nations,
to a general understanding as to marine
trade. the ports of the world are free to
international commerce and equally free to
the ships of ail nations.
What is required to promote -this trade
in this country? What has been done in
this country? For a very long time euccessive min istries have been making the
waterways over which we have control deep,
safe, comanodious, and abundantly lighted,
providing economical pilotage systems.
which tend to make voyages safe; and
providing at the principal ports cornmodious and well.equipped harbours and
storiege accommodation, so that the -traffic
which. has brought a vessel o'f-any nationality here can be quickly and cheaply
bandled. That work is, and has been well
carried on in Canada. From this we hope
the same results at our ocean ports as have
followed the same enterprise at such
European ports as Antwerp and Rotterdamn
and Glasgow. The importance of tis
question is based on the view that il a vessel
meets with di-saster-and on any route vezsels are hiable to meet disasters-the quicker
that vessel can be got into commission a.gain and in shape to resume her
voyage just to that extent you make
more efficient her tonnage for carrying on the commerce of -the world.
Therefore docks with proper appliences for
the repair of vessels are of great, importance. Every vessel requires docking at
least once a year, whether or not she
touches strends or is in collision. At the
present moment -there is a drydock in
Montreal-I amn speaking of docks of the
fitst importance; there is another at Quebec, another at Halifax, and on this part
o! the north Atlantic route there is another
andi, I believe, a smaller one at St. John's,
Newfoundland. The distance of haIt of the
trensatlantic voyage, say from Quebec to
Liverpool, is 1,436 miles. A vessel meeting
with an accident on the eastern part o! the
voyage can go to St. John's, Newfoundland.
That would be the nearest dock until she
arrived at or near St. Piarre-Miquelon.
There she is about 730 miles from Quebec
and somewhat over 200 miles from Halifax
-considerable distances.
1 wish to -point out the advisability of
protecting the rest of the route, that 730
miles, by the provision of a suitable dock
at, the port of Sydney. AIl the eeagoing
traffic of the St. Lawrence, which in the hast
year of peace was over 6,000,000 tons, passes
within 90 miles of Sydney. Sydney bas a
S-8

i

rail connection. It has two steel plants,
one on either side of the harbour, which
are the largest in Canada. It has in its
immediate vicinity the greatest eupply of
coal, and it is the cheapest place on the
Atlantic seaboard where bunker coal can
be obtained. It is, 1 think 1 arn justified
in saying, unrivalled or almost unrivalled
among ail the harbours of the world in
the entire absence o>f outlying dangers, the
regularity of soundings from blue. water
converging like a funnel right into the
mouth of the harbour, the shelter which it
affords makin-g it a secure port; and within
that harbour there is not a rock or shoal.
These are extraordinary advantages. The
conformation of the land also is such that
within that harbour there is more than one
place where the largest dock could be
established, and where there would be
practically no weather in which the dock
could not be entered and left. There are
im~portant docks in Canada and elsewhere
whose value is minimized by the fact that
under certain conditions of .wind and tide.
for many hours and in some extreme cases
possibly for some days, vessels can neither
enter nor Jeave. In addition, the elaborate
and extensive plants of two steel comparfies
require large machine shops capable of
handling the large pieces of work which
are ordinarily required, even in plants ofthe greatest aize, and a large corps of
highly-skilled mechanics able to undertake
any kind of steel work. There is no doubt
that in cases of emergency those plants
would be available to supplement the plants
which would be attached to such a drydock.
Moreover, the situation of Sydney is such
that AI is peculiarly well fitted for
the

that
distance fromn what one might oeIl the
area tributary to the dock at St. John's,
NewfouncUand, up to Quebec, is 730 miles.
For 430 miles of that distance Sydney is
the nearest point, namely, from a point
some distance west of Anticosti-the Magdalen river-dow-n to a point east of St.
Pierre-Miquelon and up to the straits of
Belle Isle. There is no place which would
be more suitable for à dock whieh would
accommodate so great a -proportion of the
voyage, say more than one-quarter of the
whole voyage from Quebec to a Europeen
port. than Sydney.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: What is the exact
distance between Quebec and Sydney?
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: It is 593 miles, I
think. But the dock at Quebec is, of course,
nearer to a vessel in the St. Lawrence west

of Magdalen river than a dock at Sydney
would be.
The sanie advantages apply for a certain
area Vo vessels passing south of Newfound-land and cf Nova Scotia, on their voyage
to either Canadian or American ports on
the north Atlantic. 1 have bad placed in
the hall a Government map 'which gives all
these distances, and I have had those areas
indicated which, as I calculate, would be
tributary te St. John's, Newfeundland. te
Sydney, te Quebec. and Vo Halifax, and I
would be gratified if the members of the
House would be good enough to look at
that map. I trust they will agree with me
as to the importance cf this matter, and, as
occasion may serve, cf calling the Government's attention te it, as has already been
done.
1 am aware that in ihe emergency cf tbe
present time, with the enormous calis which
are bein.a made on the reseurces of Canada,
the matter cf establishing a drydock might
possibly be a serious thing; but there is
certainly ne time more valuable Vhan the
present, for the next ensuîng years demand
effective provision of tonnage. In these
coming years we shail feel, more than we
do at tbe moment or than we did in the
recent years of peace, tbe necessity cf making the St. La'wrence route a desirable one.
One cf the great difficulties twenty years
ago in the handling cf the groving business
between the Cape Breton ceaI fields and
the St. Lawrence was the question cf insurance. That is a handicap of the St. Lawrence route still, and to some extent always
will be, because navigation in closed waters
cannot ibe as secure as navigation on the
open sea. Everytbing that is done Vo ininimize the possible loss cf life, damage Vo
cargo, damage Vo vessels, or whatever the
underwriters fear in the traffic cf any particular route, redounds Vo the advantage cf
that route. Mucb has been doue in lighting, in dredgin&, in buoying-, by all the
Governments cf Canada, and that work approaches conpletion; but more can be done,
I believe, in the way cf assistance alongthe hunes cf securing greater safety te the
vessels which in ev~er-increasing number
frequent the -St. Lawrence route, with such
great benefit Vo Canada.
There is another aspect of this generai
question of shipbuilding whicb is an important one. Supremacy on the high seas
has te inost nations at one time or another
been an extremnely attractive thing. Tbere
is pride in supremacy on the part cf citizens cf any country wbo are in that position, or approach it. Supremacy appeals to

Comnmissioner of Navization, 1914 (ousze

and valuable information on this general
question will be found in a -History of

cf Canada.
With regard te the relative positions cf the
United States and Great Britain, the House
D)ocument N\o. .66, lie which I have relerred,
gives the following figures: In 1850, the
foreign trade of the United Kingd-omn had
2,200,000 tons cf shipping; the tlnited States
had 1,439,000. In other words, Grent Britain had th-ree tons cf shipping and the
United States vessels, engaged in foreign
trade had two. Ten- yeare later, in 186W,
Great Britain haed 2,800,000 tons and the
United States had 2,380,000. Roughly, the
United States liad four tons cf shipping for
every five tons that Great Britain had. In
1912 Great Britaîn haed 10,400,000 tons; the
United States had 923,000 'tons. I~n other
words6, the United Statee had one ton o~f
sh ipping for every eleven tons which Great
Bn Vain had.
There has naturally been a tendency in
contries sncb as France and the Un-ited
States to try te revive by government aid
the past glories cf their mercantile marine.
We might almost put Canada in. the saine
clase. .There was a time when wooden shipbuilding flourished and the Maritime Provinces of Canada owned far more ahipping
in proportion te their population than any
other country. About the time of Confederation, it is currently reported, there
*was one ton cf shipping owned in Nova
Scotia for every man, woman and child in
the province. I have not been able to
obtain more accurate figures, te bring te the
attention of hononrarble gentlemen, but I
know that is commonly stated. I believe
other senators will corroborate my etatement. We are aeo on the eve of considering 'what can be done te increase the shippi-ng owned in Canada. As it is probable
that no new method of assisting the shipbuilding indnstry by governmental aid can
be d-evieed, it is well te look at what bas
been the history of the varions aids given
by the principal countries in the worid who
have engaged in that indnstry. I may say
that I undertook to investigate th-is subject entirely with a predisposition te finid
that governmental aid was of material assistance in eecuring an expansion of shipbuilding, iii those coun-tnies which had given
it. Iu a moment I will give yon figures
dealing with the principal shipbuilding
nations cf the world.
There are three forms in which assistance
has been given: first, assistance te the buildS--8i

ing of vessels and engines; second, remis,sien of duties, and, in the case of Germany.
the remission of internai. freight rates on
governmental railways; and, third, subventions for vessels of variaus classes, according to the number of miles travelled, their
speed, and the trade in which they are en-.
g-aged. According te the blue-book to which
1 have just referred, during the period between 1901 and 1911 the increase in tonnage
in the United States was 156,000 tons, or
31 per cenit. In the United. Kingdom there
was an increase of 3,509,000 tons, or 49 per
cent. In Belgium it was 55,000 tons, or 52
per cent; France, 310,000 tons, or 49 per
cent; German.y, 1,007,000 tons, or 66 per
cent; Denmark, 154,000 tons, or 60 per cent;
,Austria, 130,000 tons, or 61 per cent; Holland, 216,000 tons, or 70 per cent; Sweden,
25*1,000, or 73 per cent; Norway, 456,000 tons,
or 86 per cent. The figures, which 1 have
given are, of.course, in round numbers.
I will just mention the aid that is given in
this regard iby the various countries mentioned. In Great Britain no bounties or subsidies are given except for services in carrying the mails, and retaining fees for certain
epecially designed vessels which ean be'
called out as cruisers by the Admiralty. In
the Ulnited States, until recently, no bounties
were given. Shipbuilding materials are free
of duty, and in recent years subsidies have
been, given tp mail steamers in order to develop American shipping. In 1891, in 1902,
and again in 1915, efforts were made te establish a generous systein of bounties in that
country. In relation to the figures with
reference te American shipbuilding which I
have given, it sbould be noticed that a considerable amount of Amierican shipping
sailed under foreign flags. In August, 1914,
at the breaking- out of the war, an Act was
passed to enable that shipping to be put
under the American fiag, and 278,000 tons
were almost immediately transferred to
American registry.
In Germany subsidies, were gîven for
established lines, amounting to about £350,000 a year, or about $1,700,000.- This was in
addition to payment te mail-carriers. In
the construction of ships, exemption from
duty was granted on certain articles used
in shipbuilding, and there wa-s a material
reduction in railway rates for those mateniais.
The exact value -of that is
neot ascertarLable, but varions writers
on the sn.bject say that it is very
considerable. Germany also gives -nal'igation bounties in the form of a
reduction ocf inland rates on through bills
of ladin-, te East Africa and the Levant.
It is interesting te note here-and I.give it

SENATE

on the autbority of the London Times of
July 17, last year-that Germany proposes
to restore lier merchant shipping after the
war by direct bonuses to orwners of vessels
lost, captured, or interned, which amount
to about 60 per cent of her shipping. The
bonuses to be given depend upon the space
of t.ime in which new shipping is built. If
the wor< is done in three years the shipowner will get fro*m 60 to 80 per cent of
the value; if it is done in from four to six
years hie will get fromn 40 to 60 per cent,
and if if. is done froin seven to fine years
he will get between 20 and 40 per cent.
In Norway the only bounties given cover
customns duties on the iiaterials used in
the construction of vessels. They amnount
to about 52 cents-two and threepence-peT gross ton -for steel ships with engines
and hoilers made in Norway. In the ten
years between 1901 and 1911, only £50,000
were paid as bounties, and yet Norway's
increase in shipping was enormous. More
of hier ships entered the ports. of the United
Kingdom than of any other country. In
1913-14, 11,000,000 tons of Norwegian and
10,000,000 tons of Germian shipping entered
British ports; in 1913 Norway built 50,000
tons and bought 50,000 tons more from
Great Britain.

In Belgium. materials enter free, and loans
are made to certain. shipping companies
trading in the Mediterrianean, the Argentine
and the Levant trades.
Austria bas given large shipbui]ding subsidies. Under the law of 1907, which was in
force when this blue-book was compiled,
she gave £1, 13s. 4d., per ton. and 6s. Sd. for
every 100 kilos of machinery when hall of
it was made of Austrian material. Navigation bounties b.ased on one penny per
ton per 100 -sea miles, and limited to a
maximumr of something over $1,100,000 per
year were given. Her policy seems to have
protected her own trade. In 1901 Austrian
entries amounted to 1,300,000 tons; in 1911
they amounted to over 2,000,000; -while
foreign entries only increased from about
600,000 to 900,000 toýns.
France bas ibeen giving bounties for
construction and subsidies since 1881. The
Act of 1906 was in force at the outbreak of
the war. Its main provisions are the granting of a maximum bouinty of £6, 18s. per

thi6 bad dropped to 28 per cent.
Japan lias an elaborate system. of bounties, payable only to Japanese companies
or Japanese subjects for materials of Japanese manufacture, and undoubtedly it
bas greatly increased trade. Between 1901
and 1911 Japanese sbipping incTeased fromn
3,000,000 tons to 9,000,000 tons, while loreign
sbipping inicreased fromn 7,000,000 tons ta
10,000,000 tons-in one case aibout 300 per
cent, and in the other about 30 par cent.
Hon. Mr. EflWAiRDS: Is there any discrimination against foreign shipping in
their ports?
Hon. Mr. MoLENNAN: Niyt as I am

speak positively on that point.
From these figures it would appear that

would form a basis of action at the presant
moment. For example, in 1901 Norway and
France had practically an equal am4Yunt of
tonnage, France having 527,000 tons and
Norway 531,000 tons. Buring the ten-year
period rwhicb I bave mentioned French
tonnage incraased ¶by 310,000 -tons while that
of Nor-way increased by 456,000 tons. In
other words the Norwegi-an tonnage inincreased 50 per cent more than thait açf
France, altbo'ugh Norway spen't only S250,000 in promoting 6hipping during that time,
wbereas France spent $75,000,000.
It is perfectly obvious that ot-her considerations have to do -with the inrcrease in
the shîipping of any country. To my mmnd
it la a question of the relative attractiveness of the various employments of the
,country. The decline in American, sbipiping

nouncement ai gravest importance. -although
presented, as it seemed ta me, in a very
casual manner. This permanent policy deals
with only one portion ai the maritime sections ai Canada, that is, the Atlantic portion, and, with the exception ai the atatement regard'ing a smaîl cantract issued ta
a single yard on the Pacifie coast, it seems
ta leave eut ai consideration the poasibility that there may be mare need for the
development ai a shipbuilding policy, particularly ai a steel shipbuilding policy, on
the Pacific coast ai Canada than on the
Atlantic coast. It is a fact apparent ta ail
who live in British Calumbia that we have
been mare thoraughly stripped ai shipping
than has any other portion ai Canada, perhaps than any ather portion ai the British
Empire, and that we stand ta suifer more
fram the absence ai shipping at the
conclusion ai the war, -during the
periad af rearrangement, than does any
ather part in which we are interested.
It seems ta me that in view ai a condition
ai that kind any permanent policy ai shipbuilding for Canada should have taken into
cansideration the very grave need ai the
province ai British Columbia. I may ay,
and 1 think I caný say it with justification,
that 1 was disappointed when I read the
announcement of the policy af the Government, made, as it was, sa shortly atter a
large and influential and thoroughhy officiai
delegation fromn the province ai British
Calumbia had waited upon the ministry to
ask them te assist in taking the first step
ta establish an iran and steel îndustry in
that province preparatory ta engaging in
the building ai the ships which we so badhy
-need. Atheugh in the announicement ai a
permanent policy the request ai that delegatian has been left unanswered i n crne
sense, it is answered in a most distressing
way so far as aur ambitions are concerned
by the -afficial statement, that while the
Government has made or la making a substantis.l cantract with a very large industry
in eastern Canada ta provide for shipbuilding needs in the way ai plates for the
next five years, and that there will ha
remissian ai duty upan ahl the inaterials
which they have ta import which will enter
inta the equipment ai their mammoth
establishment, this ia coupled with the
announcement that no other persan or
intarest need apply. True, this is accompanied by the friendly statement an the
part ai the minister that, if in the light ai
this announecement any ather persans think

milis in Canada, hie will be very pleased to
see them do sa. I cannot share the
pleasure of the honaurable minister, because
it must be patent ta any person who
reflects for a moment on the situation here
outlined that no private enterprise could
possibly compete with a government-encouraged, government-contracted and govindustry, particularly
ernment-favoured
an industry already se well established and
so littie In need ai special faveur as is the
industry in Nova Scotia which is referred
ta in the ministerial statement.
It is not generally knawn in Canada, and
until lately it has nat tbeen appreciated even
in British Columbia, that while in the steelmaking industry of eastern Canada the are
used is almost exclusively-perhaps exclusively-imparted fram outside of the
boundaries ai Canada, that were we ta establish the industry an the Pacifie coast the
condition wauld bie the very oppo-site. We
have on that caast boundless resaurces in
iran are situated mare favaurably than any
large bodies ai iran are-I thin-k I arn safe
in saying anywhere in the civilized warldere with a better combinatian of the thingas
that ge ta the successful and econamical
production ai iran. We have the combination ai are close ta tidewater, ef unlimited
coal, and of lime in endiess iquantity; and
added ta ail these we have the finest waterpowers and as well advanced electrîcal develapment as is needed ta secure ail the
necessary electrical pawer for smelting or
fer the application of the product ai the
smelters for even a great province like
British Columbia for snany years ta came.
We have aîl thase conditions, but we need a
littie help ta put them into use. I suggest
in ahl seriousness ta the Government that
before embarking upon the policy formally
announced as the permanent palicy, there bie
an addition ta it af some measure ai promise
ta the province ai British Columbia which
will indicate that we will flot continue ta
be so completely forgotten in the future.
But, honourable gentlemen, it seems ta me
that there is another subject ta be considered

to warrant us in any action indicating any
belief, any seif-deception, that we are near
the end of the war and can commence to
talk now of what will corne alter rather
than wh-at is necesaary for the successful
prosecution of the war. I would much rather
that this honourable House were engaged
to-day in the consideration of a vigorous
programme to supply the pressing needa of
Canada with respect to transportation during the war than that we should stand that
aside and take up the permanent policy in
preference to it. I have especially in mnind
the subject of wooden ships, to which the
resourcea of the province o! Blritish Columbia particularly lend themselves. A littie
over a year ago, I think it wvas, a programme
of wooden shipbuilding was embarked upon
under the auspices of the Imperial Munitions Board. It is true that this board is
not controlled by the Government o!
Canada, but it is equally true that the
money of the Canadian people is behind it
so far as its operations in Canada are concerned. We must assume, although the
transactions o! the Board are conducted
with a greater degree of privacy than I
would die to see, that its actiong are well
considered before they are taken, and that
gentlemen of the experience and prestige
which, led to'their appointment as members
of that Board have been supplied with
efficient advisers, so that no programme
upon which the Board may seriously
embark to-day may be wantonly thrown
over to-morrow by their successors as not
being- worthy o! con sideration. 1 ar n ot
sufficiently well posted on the comparative
merits o! wooden ships and steel ships to
be able to say whether there is so great a
difference as to warrant the consideration
of the complete abandonment of a wooden
ahipbuilding policy in favour of steel shipbuilding; but I arn content to take the
authority of the Imperial Munitions Board
for the present, and to say that this honourable House is entitled to some evidence
th.at the Board were wrong in embarking
upon their policy of wooden shipbuilding
before we make ourselves a party to abandoning that policy and scrapping ail the
expensive equipment with which they have
supplied the several yards in British Colurmbia. Speaking roughly, I shou*ld say
that that equipment has cost at. least
$1,000,000. It has been used only for the
first order o! shipa to be built under the
auspices of the Board. Those ships have
been completed without any trouble whatever. Tke little city of New Westminster,
from which. I corne, which had no shipyard

belore, has now a yard established for the
purpose under the auspices of that Board.
We have already built four ships; two o!
them, I believe, have been launched-at
least, they were ready to lanch several
weeks ago-and the others are very near
completion. There are five or six other
yards in British Columbia in the same.
condition. It seems to me that we shouid
think aeriously belore we consent to scrapping ail those yards and saying that simply
because steel ships will be more permanent
than wooden ones wve will refuse the assistance of those six yards to continue
wooden ehipbuilding.
The other day il saw in a leading financial paper of Canada an estimate of what
we may hope to get in the way o! increased
production, as a result of the combined
efforts o! the Canada Food Board and allied
l5oarda and the patriotism. and energy of
the whole Canadian people, and I realized
that the total substance o! that increased.
production as stated. by this authority,
would equal only the wheat that could be
brought from Australia by the ships that
British Columbia could turn out fromn existing yards within the next year if we were
permitted to do so. It seems to me that
rather than gamble on the chance of getting this increased production, with the
possibility o! adverse weather and other
dangers, it would pay us much better as
a country to bank on a certainty and to
say that we know that in Australia there
are 600,000,000 bushels o! wheat awaiting
transhîpment, and that we will bend al
our energy to putting ships upyon the
Pacific ocean to go down to Australia and
move that wheat to Canada- - Honourable
gentlemen, we have a wheatless elevator
at the port of Vancouver; we have two
trafficless railways, supported by the Government, which, unlesa we provide traffic
for them, will become streaks of rust while
we continue to find the money for the
interest on the debt accumulated by them.
It seems to me that it would be much
better business to provide traffic for those
railways to ensure against the possîbility
or famine in this country than fo abandon
ail effort and to say that we will not touch
these wooden shipa because -alter the war
there will be more money in having steel
shi-ps on our bands.
As a matter of money alone a very
simple calculation can be made. Under
the contract to be let the ships cost the
Imperial Munitions Board about $500,000
each. With the experience gained by those
yards they can be produced for much less.

SENATE

22

But taking- the value at $500,000, as established by the experts of the Imperial Munitions Board, each one of those wooden ships
could carry about 150,000 bushels of wheat.
The round trip between British Columbia
and Australia can be made in two months.
Even if those ships took nothing but ballast from British Columbia to Australia,
they would each return with 150,000 bushels
of wheat, which, by the simple pi-ocess oi
transfer from, Australia to Vanc'ouver would
become worth-instead of less than one
dollar, the price paid for the wheat by the
Government of Australia-anything over
the minimum price of $2.21, which was
established by the Government of Canada
as the price to be paid for wheat in Canada. So, honourable gentlemen, you will
see that those ships delivering wheat to.

Government of Canada, would earn the

Board will cost us $500,000 for the year. I
amn convinced that a more substantial benefit would acciue by putting that $500,000
into one ship and sending it ont to bring
this wheat than we can expect fromi the
efforts of the Food Board, intelligently,
actively, and earnestly directed though
they may be.
I have 6aid enough, I think. If thpre be
any ground at ail for the calculations which
1 have made to ehow that there is a reason
for the appeal which I have made to the
Goverriment before finally embarking upon
a permanent policy and entering intû a contract-which I think la not yet signed, and
-%%hiceh would preclude any other contract
-ith like industries in other parts of Canada-it would be as well to consider particularly the peints I have mentioned.
The province of British Columbia should
be guaranteed a substantial share in any
steel sbipbuilding programme. We should
utilize the established shipyards in British
Columbia to continue the building o!
wooden ships until isuch time as we have
steel ships in sight to take their place.

both sides wherever there is a farm crossing.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I should like to ask
the honourable leader of the House why the
word "wilfully" is left in. It appears to
me that the trouble is caused by leaving
the gate open, and it makes very little difference, as far as accidents are concerned,
whether the gate is left open wilfully or
negligently. It seems to me that the word
"wilfulily" should not be there if the section is- going to have any effect. If it is left
there, a man who leaves a gate open may
say, "I did not intend to do it; I did not
do it wilfully; I did not think anything
about it, and so it happened."
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There is
a great deal in what the honourable gentleman says, but it is quite a burden to place
upon the owner of the property, that he
must pay a fine of $20 if he accidentally
leaves his gate open. It must be remembered that the railway has gone through
his property and has constructed those
gates. It would seem that the leaving open
of the gate would be wilfully done.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: It appears to me that
no one would.confess that he left the gate
open wilfully. The trouble is caused by
leaving the gate open, and I think negligence as well as wilfulness should be punishable.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The section is for' the
protection of the public. I think the suggestion of the honourable gentleman from
St. John (Hon. Mr. Daniel) is in the proper
direction.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I move that the wor<1
"wilfully" be taken out.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Does not that make
a farmer who leaves a gate open liable to a
penalty of $20?
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Yes.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I would suggest the
substitution of the word "knowingly" for
the word "wilfully."
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What is the matter with "negligently?"
Hon. W. B. ROSS: If you take out the
word "wilfully" and the gate is opened by
a neighbour's child, for instance, the farmer
is going to be liable.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: If you are going
to make any alteration at all, I would suggest that the word "negligently" be substituted.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I draw the
attention. of honourable gentlemen to the
fact that it is not only the leaving open of
the gate which is an off ence, but the leaving
of it open without some person being at or
near such gate to prevent animals passing
through it on to the railway. If that is the
offence, I wonder why the word "willully"
is there. It is a question of fact. It will
be impossible to establish that the gate
was left open wilfully; but the simple fact
that the law has been violated by leaving
the gate open without leaving some one
there to see that no animals move to and
fro is easy to establish.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: It seems to me
that the intention of thé Act is plain. As
you all know, farmers hauling grain from
the backs of their farms to their barns
generally leave the gates open between
fieIds, even when they are passing through
pasture fields. As a consequence, the gate
is left open wilfully, and if it were left
unprotected cattle might stray onto the
track. If they did such a thing, they
should leave some one to guard the gate'
and keep the cattle off the track.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The judge or
magistrate will have to decide whether it
is done through negligence or malice prépense. I would take it that the word
"wilfully" means that there must be malice
prépense-a design.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I think the point to
be considered is not so much the penalty
as the effect that it may have upon the
running of the railway and the safety of the
public. If a gate is left open either wilfully or negligently, and in consequence
cattle stray on to the track and a train
comes along and runs over one of those
cattle, and is thrown off the track and
twenty or thirty people are killed, it is a
very serious matter. I do not think that
it would be possible to convict a man of
leaving a gate open if the word "wilfully"
were left in the section.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The word "negligently" commends itself to me. Under the
section as it stands one might escape all
liability if he put in evidence that the gate
was left in charge of a child or a small boy
who would not be able to protect it sufficiently. Therefore, if you want to be able
to enforce the provision you can do so only
by using the word "negligently."
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
would be in contradiction to the precaution
which is taken in the third line of the sub-

APRIL 15, 1918
section, "without some person being at or~
near sueli gate."
Hon. Mr. BRLCOURT: The pei'son put
at the gate for the purpose of preventing
animais passing through niay net be such
a person as is capaible of doing- that, and
the person ac'cused would get off .by pointing out that hie put a boy of five or six
years cd age t.here: If the word - negligentIy " were used, hie would nlot escape.
Hc>n. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: What
would my honaurable friend do in the case
mentianed by the honourable gentleman
from Prince Edward Island (Hon. Mr.
Murphy), where the gates were ivilfully left
open for a particular purpose, nimely, the
passing, from one field to another. It could
not be said then that they. were lef t open
negligently. In regard to the immature person who may be left in charge, I think the
law may presume that such a person would
have to be of such intelligence as to meet
the requirements of the Act.
Hon. Mr. POWER.: I agree with the
-honourable gentleman from St. Johni (Hon.
Mr. Daniel). I think thig section is supposed to provide a remedy to the railway
company againat the wilful action -of Romeone who leaves a gate open. If you leave
the word «*wilfully " there, it seems ta mie
that it wauld be almost impossible for a
railway company to secure a conviction before a magristrate of any one who left a gate
open, because you could not prove that it
was done wilfully. I think everyone is presumed to consider the effect of his act, and
-I
for one would be prepared te vote for the
amendment te strike out the word "wilfully.Hon. Mr. WATSON: I do not wish to interpret what the word - wilfully"- means,
but it appears tu me that it is in, lavour of
the fariner. I think that any jury would
came to the conclusion that any gate left
open for the purpose stated by the honourable gentleman from Prince Edward Island
(Hon. Mr. Murphy) would nlot be left open'
wilfully-it would not be for the purpose
et allowind animàls te geV on the track.
With regard te the question of protection, it
would probably take a host cf men te keep
a jersey bull off the track. I do nlot think
a fariner, as a rule, allows his cattie to get
on the tradk.
Hon. Mr. BELGOURT: He allows the
other fellow's.
Honý. 'Mr. WATSON: I remember the late
William White saying that the mest valuable cattle in the Northwest that lie kniew
of-he would net naine any special breed-

Pacific railway locomotives. But as a rule
I think a tarmer tries to keep his cattle off
the track. I agree with the hon«ourable
gentleman fromn Halifax (Hon. Mr. Power)
that we should make every provision for
the safety cf the public, but I am inclined
te think it will [be more in the interest cf
the farraer te have the word " wilfually"
left in.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Is that the old
clause?1
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:- Yes.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: It does not seemn ta

%Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It is in order that

Han. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: 1 do not see in

You will find that the liet of noxious weeds

I do not want to m<>ve an arnendmnent to

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I would
.say to my honourable friend that there is
not; but, inasmuch as action or procedure
would be taken within a particular province, the law of that province 'would &er.

There would be ne doubt about it.
'H-on. Mr. WATISON: I amn inclined to

Our province is prabalbly freer from weeds

are trying to keep it se; but in this effort
,we are very rnuch handicapped because
the railway runs from one' end of the province Wo the other, -and on the part o! the

would ask the honouralble leader of the
Government te take sorne steps to see that
the Railrway Departrnent better their efforts
in this direction.
Section 408 was agreed to.
Sections 409 to 412, inclusive, were agreed
te.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

On section 413-notification, of accidents:
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Sorne exception
is taken te the second si.lbsection o! section
413, 1 understand, by the railway erniployees
in Canada who are affected by it. It is a
new clause, and, 1 thînlc, o>ught net te be
inserted in the Act. Honoursible gentlemen
will recaîl that at the session of Parliament last year, when the Railway Act was
under conaideration, it was aeked, thiat provision be mnade Ln the first s-ulbsection of
section 413 which would enable a oonductor
or ether empleyee Wo report direct te the
*Raibway Commission the fact that an accident had eccurred. The reason the amendment waa sought was that, at leaet in
seme instances, days had ela'psed, in other
cases weeks, before the commission was
even aware that a serions accident had
eecurred at a certain point on the railway. The commission was then unable te
make any investigation of the causes of the
accident, because meanwhile the evidence
had ail been removed. The Senate viewed
that suggestion with favour and exdbodied
the amendment in the Act passed iast year.
Now iA appears that a new clause La inserted te -make it compulery upon the
conductor te furnish that report. I arn
pleased te note that this is oertainiy a
clear vindka-tion of the prepT-iety of the
suggestion that was made last year that
the'conductor ought to be permitted te advise the commission direct, for the propoai
now is that hie shall be compelled te do se.
I would, hewever, like te point eut te
honourabie gentlemen that this requirement is scarcely fair te the emplnoyee, because of the fact that hie may be seriousiy
ir.jured as a resuit of the wreck, or hie May
have se many duties te perform at the
time, in endeaveuring te clear the line or
Wo render relief te persons who may be
injured, etc., that hie rnay overlook sending the telegrarn, and because of that omission he is te be penalized. Omission is a

to the present time it has net been necessary for the conductor te send in such a
report. It was even suggested by the railways last year that hie ought nbt te be
permîtted Wo send such a report; but the
empieyees said: " Gentlemen, we think
that the 6ommission ought te be advised
of serieus accidents, se that they may niake
an investigation in the public interest as
eariy as possible after the accident eccurs,
and if possible before the evidence of the
causes of it have been entirely removed."
I think the additienal responsibility ought
flot te be forced upon the employees, because there is perhaps net one cenductor

fit ta impose a penalty upon the railway
cumpany for failure ta report-ought flot to
be extended ta, the employees, wha are
probably in most cases flot familiar with
the Act.
C.AS'GRAffK: I do not think that
'Hon. M-fr.

point that il would make, and it is a serieus matter, is that the conductar in making
a report to the Board migit. find himeelf
in a very bad position as regards the comipany, because in the excitement ai the
accident hie mar rnake a report which will
result iii the conipany being mulcted for
a very large amount, because hie has not
mnade the report as it should be made.
The conductor, flot wiahing to displease
those who employ him, who give him his
daily bread, would probably malte a repart
which would be very guarded in order nio
only ta pratect the company but also ta,
save huxnseli iramn being blamed by 'the
crimpany for reporting too much.,
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: It is not a report
which is required; it is merely a notice.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: If the section sunply aays a notice of the accident shahl be
givën. that is different.
Hon. -Mr. DAN DURAND: If 1 ain not

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: "Possible" and
"practicable" would mean tixe saine thing

Hon. W. B. ROSS: No, they do not. "As

Hon. W. B. ROSS: Beeause, if the em-'
ployee ia hurt. or if tihere ia a bad smash-up
and lx. is very bus-y looking aiter passengers. it might not be impossible for him ta
send notice, but it vould. be impracticable.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I reniember very
well the discussion that took place in the
cainmittee last year, but I do not think that
the objection which the honourable gentlemani from Welland (Han. Mr. Robertson)
makea, that poaaibly -a conductar or other
employee may be injured, exista at all under this clause, ibecause the wox-ding- ai the
section is not "every conductor or other
emplayee,» but "any conductars or other
employeea making a report ta the campany
ai the occurrence." Sa, if the conductar or
other employee is able ta make a report ta
the company, lie is surely able aleo ta make
it ta the Railway Board. Therefore I think
the abjection the honourable gentleman
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) makes is, not borne
out. I remember that, as the honourable
gentleman states, there was a deputation
asking for something of this very nature;
and nou' that it is px-ovided in the Bill it
does not appear ta give satisfaction. WhY
is that?
Hon. Mr. RICHARDSON: An accident
does not always result in loss ai hife. Somnetirnes it is simply a derailment. How aiten
does the consiganee ]ase his freighlt because
it is smashed up' A car may be only
partially damnaged and a leakzage may accur;

accident was reported ta, the Raihway Board
and it were pi aced on recrd that a certain

lon. Mr. DANIEL: I think the honourable gentleman perhiaps bas not noticed
the ifirst part of the &ection. The railway
company hias got to improperly refuse to
chieck the baggage before it becomes hiable,
and under those circumsatances I tbink the
penalty should be a large one. -The value
of the baguage does not make any difference. There ie no reference to the value
of the baggage at ail. The section deals
entirely with the improper refusal to check
baggage, and imposes a penalty upon the
comrpany, not because it refuses to check
baggage of a certain value, but because if
refus-es to put a cbeck, on if at ail]
Hon. Mr. WATSON: The value o! tîje
goodE lias nothing to do witli the matter.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: 0f course, tbe owvner
of the- goo>ds -should have recourse at coinmon law to the extent of the damage which
be suffered. I do not tbink the amount
should be raised to $100, because the
refusai would be the act. not of the comnpan!, but o! a negligent employee, and you
woiuld be penalizing'the company. 1 think
the clause is all riglit as iA is. It is not
intended to cover damages. Tbe person
complaining would not receive any part o!
the penalty if it were $100.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The honourable
gentleman from Welland (Hon. Mr. Rlobertson) says that lie lias had experieiice. Do
not the railways often refuse to checlh
baggacae because there is no proper place to
put thie check on it, or because it may iot
properly be cailed baguage or is flot properly boxed in or locked up? In a case of
that kind a baggagemnan lias an ýexcuse for
refusing to clieck it. I bave bneen refused
myself, the bagg-ageman saying, "No, we
won't -clieck that; that is ail express parcel." For instance, suppcse that, instead
of the goods or ciotbing being put in a
trunk, they are boxcd, they will refuse to
check that-.box althougli it mav coutain
what might properly be called baggage.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think the requirement is that there shall be a proper
place to affix a check.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: That is wlbat -the
section says.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: But if is more
far-reaching than that. Many unlawful attempts, are mad-e to bave bagg.ag-e carried

on railways. People sometimecs attem.pt to
send baguage, or trunks containing.soniething that is not wearing apparel, on someone else's transportation. The rail'way employees-4icket 6ervice and baguage menhave to exerci6e the greatest caution to prevent the company they are serving fromn
being defrauded, and 1 eu(bmit that there
should not ebe a minimum penalty of $100
in vease sorne employee does not exercise
proper judgment, 'because, aithougli lie inay
think hie is exercising excellent judgmient,
if it is proven upon investigation that lie
lias fot done so, the coxnpany is fined, and
will be prone to blame hlim for being overzealous on their :behaîf. 1 think, it sb~ou1d
read "flot exceeding $100."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Will the lionourable gentlemian fell -me why this
clause makes the amount of the fine
payable too the passenger, and liquidates
the damnage to which the passenger
is enfitled? Penalties generally go to
the Goverrnment. but this section purports to fix the amount to which. the
pa6ssenger ies entitled if the company refuses
f0 carry his baug-age, and, as At stands, it
imentions a miximumn of $8. Is it not departing froin the general policy of the Act?
Hon. W. B. ROSS5: The honourabie gentleman has just mentioned a matter about
w1hich. I was going to spea'k. I think this
section 434 is bad, for the reason wbich
the honourable gentleman mentioned and
perhaps for one or two others. I doubt
very mnuch if we have the jurisdliction io
limit the amount of damages iu a civil
acio on the part of a passengerlobs
asked to have bis bagrgage cbecked. I auji
in a position to know that there are cases,
in wbich neither $8 nor $100 would be
anything like adequate compensation to a
man for not having bis baguage checked
at a partieular place. Cases of thiat kind
bave occurred, particularly in the experience of men going frcs(m cities in tbe Upper
Provinces to catch a steamer. If anyfbing
goes wrong, $8 or $1*10 is flot adequate
compensation. You can imna.ine cases
wbere the loss is not mierely the nersonal
baggag-e; it may ie important documents.
Now, if you refer to section 351 you will
see that it throws upon the company the
dufv of cbecking baguagea and of course
gaives the company the rig-ht to collect toil
before giving the check. Section 434, inctead of affixing a penalty of $5-or $10 and
leaving the question of the civil action
open, sets the penalty question aside and
deais wif.h the civil action. I doubt, as I
say, if that can properly lie doue; but even

APRIL 15.,1918

if it can be done, I think it is ail wrong,
and 1 suggest this amendment:
If any raiiway conipany imnproperly refuses
upon demnand ta affix a check ta any parcel of
baggage, baving a handile, loap or suitabie,
ineans for attachinc a check thesreupon, delivered
by a passenger ta t1he« ompany for transport,
or ta delivei, a duplicate8 of such check to auoh
passenger, the omspany shall be guilty of an
offence and lhable 4o0 a fine of a sum flot exceeding $10 ; but nothing In tls section shall
be deemed ta take away the righ4. of thie

passenger ta mnaintain a civil action.
I think that that would meet the case.

SECRET SESSION 0F HOUSE 0F
COMMONS.
ATTENDANCE OF SEINATE.

Before the Orders of. the Day:
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: I beg leave to offer
a suggestion to the honourable leader of the
Governinent in this House. The Prime
Minister yesterday annour.ced in another
place that a session of Parliament would
be held within closed doors to receive very
important informatioýn from the British
Gnvernmient regarding- the war zituation.
The Prime «Minister stated that everybMdy
wotild bcek&cluded from that session except miem)bers of the House of Comanons
and niembers of the Senate. Our rules cali
for the mieeting' of the Senate at 3 o'clock
to-rnorrow afternoon. MIy suggestion is thiîs,
that it will be necessary not only for the
memnbers of the House of Commons to be
present and listen to that confidential information or whatever rnay be said
thereon, but aliso for -the meni-bers of
the Senate to have the saie information
iniparted to them.
It could flot be unparted to thein unless they were present.
1 therefore suggest to the honourable leader
(>f the Governinent that when .he moves the
adjournment of the House this afternoon
or to-night he should move that th'e H-ouse
may adjourn so that the members of the
Senate may be enabled to attend the secret

-1X

session to-morrow afternoon.
I sua-est
that when this House meets at 3 o'clock
Nve should call it 6 o'clock, so that we mav
ail go in a body to the House of Commons.
Hon. GEORGE TAYLOR: Or adjourn
during pleasure.
Hon. Mr. OCLORLAN: Or the honourable
leader of the Government could move that,
when the House adjourns to-day, it stand
adjourned until the secret session is over.
0f course, nobody knows whether it will
take a quarter of an hour, haif an hour,
or an hour. Another suggestion would be
that the honoû'rable leader of the Government nove that the House adjourn until
to-morrow evening at 8 ýo'clock. We could
do as much work between 8 and 10 or il
o'clock to-morrow night as we could during
the afternoon.
I make these suggestions
or behaîf -of members of this House.
especially myseif, who would like to receive
the important information to be communicated by the Prime Minister to the Parliamient of Canada.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I discussed the natter with my honourable
fr'end the leader on the opposite aide of
thie House (Hon. Mr. Bostock) and we
agreed that, with the leave of the bouse.
we should adjourn -to-morrow after the
bouse opened, for the purpose of attendit g the secret session.

be well to have the new section I intended to

for the information of honourabe meembers. A portion of tis section 374 was oniginally in part of what is now section 373,
when the new Railway Bill was introduced
into the House of Conunons. The last-part
of it, subsection 5, was a piece of special
leg-isiation put into the Bill after it was
introduced into the House of Commons, and
thereupon section 373 of the Bill as it was

Hon. M.Nr.
MACDONELL: '%r. Chiairman
and honourable gentlemen, the amiendments
that have been proposed and read to the
comniittee revolutionize-if I m.av use -the
w-ord-the entire dealings in the past with
viower companies and companies for the
transmission of power. I wili endeavour
to prove to the honourahie gentlemehn present that the legisiation in regard to power
lias been consistent for the last twenty or
thirty years, and' that the power clauses
in . section 374 of this Bill are just in
line with what bas been the policy
of the Parliament of Canada since Parliament started deaiing wvith power cornpanies. -or since power companies start.ed in business. The effect of the amendnment which is now moved would be to intensify and perpetuate the hardships from
which miunicipalities are now suffering. The

consequence of passing the aniendrnent
wouid be worse than if -section 374 were
taken out of the Bill entireiv and no legislation whatever were enacted on the point
under consideration. I was a member oi
the select committee of the House of Comnions to which this Bill was referred'. It
was before the committee lor some
months. This section particularly. was
under discussion for some weeks. Men
came from ail parts of Canada to
give evidence before the committee. The
muicipalities and other public interesta

were there represented.
of the section is complicated, and yet
it is very compiete and ample. It is
more or less interlaced with the rest of
the Bill, and for the first time power cornpanies .a're segregated or separated, in the
general legisiation of Can.ada, from telegraph, telephone and raii'way colTepanies.
Section 374 exubodies; ail the existing law
with regcard to power companies which. was
put into -a section by itself so tîhat it would
be simple, easily understood, and eaisily
compiied. with.
Now, it is impossible to deal off hand with
the amendment which is proposed. I am
not in the least alarmed a-bout the result
of this eection; but it is difficuit to deal
with it now, after nionths of discussion in
the Gommnons over it. T'his -amendment
m-akes conditions worse for the public, because subsection 5 perpetuates ad infinitum
the powers of the coinpany granted in its
special Act. The whoie crux of the difficulty is tliat the Toronto and Niagara
Power Company had a specLal Act whichthey got through this Parliarnent in 1902,
and wh.ich g-ave them greater powers than
any. other company had theretofore or has
since been given. They are a law unto
themnseives. Tiiey correspond exactiy with
the definition given by the honourable gentleman fromi M-iddleton (Hon. W. B. Ross)
of the attitude of t.he public -and of municipalities with regard to the very section
under consideration. It is the comipanies
wvho have ail tlîe devouring of wealth, and
they hope to entrencli themnselves behind tht
leguislation which niy honourable friend proposes. They tvouid then be a public menace ad înfinitum. There is a difficulty,
therefore, in deaiing finally with section 374
at this particular moment, because of the
comîplication in the section now moved in
amendment, but subsection. 5 makes it repugnant to anybody who heard the digcussion in the Hou-se of Comnxons committee
and has foliowed thîis question in the public
interest, because it proposes te continue the

before the railway board; but the proposed
amendmnent does not attempot to correspond
with either of two tliingas: either the exist-

ing law or the existing publie opinion with
regard to theý matter.
. New, 1 will refer just briefiy to the consideration which was given -this section and
the reasons for its being enacted. The meinorandum wh-dch is submitted. to the honourable members of this House by the railway
commission makes mention of the fundamental changes in the law. In section 374,
at page 6 of the memorandum, copies of
which have been distributed by Mr. Blair
o4f the railway commission, it is 'stated:
Section 374, deal.ing with power cornpanies,
Is new, and Is designed to, preserve to municipalities the coruplete control of theki streets
wlth reference to the distribution system.
It is new, because it segregates power
companie-s frein other companies; but it
was contained in the old law. Let me make
this plain here and now, *as it was made

plain -in the House of Conmons. The distribution systerni is only one department
of the power cornpany's operations.
The
pover company does two or three things:
first, it generates power; secondly, -it transmits power; then it disitributes power or
selis it in communities. This co-mpany does
not zenerate power; it buvs its power from
the electrical developmnent company; but
it bas a main transmission line. I quite
agree with public opinion, and with the
okpinioni of honourable gentlemen in this

House, that it would be wrong te interdict
or prohibit a power company from using
it-- long-distance transmission system. One
community might rise up and preiverit the
continuance of the line of wires, which
would not be proper and should net
be allowed. An appeal may be mnade to
the railway board, as provided for in the
section now under consideration. The last
thin- a power comipany dees is te distribute
power, that is, to seil it in the communitv,
just as the milk-inan wvho comes around in
the morning selîs bis milk, or the baker delivers his bread. It has always been the law,
as far back at any rate as 1899, three years
prier to the tirne this comipany was incorporated by special Act-I think I could
refer back as far as 1888-that the distribution company had to get the consent of the
nrnnicipality before it cotîld build its line
and higýh-voltage conduits on the streets and
sell its power te the comml]unity. That has
Hor. '%r. MAC-DONULL.

always been the law, and is the law~ to-day,
applying to all conipanies unless and except
this company, which obtained special power

to enter ýmunicipalities and to vend power
without the leave or license of the conimunity.
Se one thing that la aimed at in this Bill

is the special provision in subsection 5 of
section 374, .whioh makes the effect of the
section retroactive to 1906; and I will give
you the reason why that was done by the
committee. It is a public necessity to have
this law as it is. 1 will explain in a word
or two by reference to what took place before the Commons committee. The crnimnittee had a hearing of the parties interested, and the inatter was discussed. at great
length in the Gommons. In No. 16 of the
special committee's report it is stated. whiat
interests appeared there and protested
against the existence oi the powers given
to this company-the Toronto and NÇiagara
Power Company-and urged the passague of
the section we are now considering.
The city of Toronto was mentioned by niy
honourable friend from Middleton (Hon. WV.
B. Ross). I mention it because Toronto has
been a sufferer; but my words aré nlot
uttered on be.half of Toronto cr of any particular comtnunity or locaiity or province.
What this company did to Toronto they can
do, unless their powers are amended, and
unless they are put in conformity with ail
other power companies, to any and every
miunicipality in Canada. T'hey can do the
saine thing as they did in Toronto, which
was to go upon the public streets -without
leave or license and chop down trees, erect
poles o! their own choosing, and generally
act as though they were the owners o! those
h igh way s
W/hile 1 amn dealing avith tlîat point, I
want to say, for it occurs to mie and it is a
propos o.! what we are discussing, that quite
recently this very company againat which
ave were trying to saieguard the public, the
Toronto and Nia-ara Powver Company, have
gene into the city of London. I will read
a memorandum reciting the facts briefly. It
shows what t.bey are doing and what tŽeawill continue for ahl tinue te de unless their
powers are restricted. The London Electrie
Company was incorporated by a certain
honourable gentleman whose naine I
will net mention, and -%vlo la present
here to-day. H1e is, I believe, als-o a direotor
of the Toronto and Niagara Power
Company. This London company bas been
doingc business in the city of London for
about 15 years. It was giaen a franchise

APRIL 16, 1918
allowing it certain rights on the st.reets
to seli and distribute electricity. It also
for a time lighted the streets and municipal
buildings. That contract ran out some years
ago, and the company was superseded by
the Hydro, (but its franchise continued.
Something over a year ago its franchise
'in London having expired, the company
was taken over by the Toronto and Niagara
Power Company, which had and has a perpetual franchise. This company raised the
rates; but, notwithstanding
this, in
February last the customers vere notified
that the company would cease doing busine*sa on April 1. An appea1 for relief was
made to t>he railway and municipal board,
and also ta t.he Dominion Railway board,but the people were told by bath of those
bodies tihat they had no jurisdiction ov.er
that company. Accardingly the people
were notified that shortly before midnight
on March 31 the campany would out off
the ligh.t and power supplied ta their consumers, includinig the Grand Trun< and
Canadian Pacifie raiiways, and the street
railway. The p9wer controller was arged
to take action and compel them ta continue the service. He asa advised Lonidon
that his order or power did nlot extend ta
this company, as its power was generated by
steam. go the company simply discontinu-ed
in London. When fuel became eheap againfor the power is generated by fuel-the
Toronto .and- Niagara Power Campany
bobbed up as the owners of this franchise,
wbich had terminated in the hands of the
original Landon Electrie Company, and they
can carry on their business in London
as long as they ple-ase. They can shlut it
down wben fuel is scarce, and they can
jack it up -again *hen fuel is cheap. That
is an instance of what they are doing. Sa,
in view of the powers of this company, it
is no wonder that the public became greatly
alarmed. The Committee of the Houseo'f
Commans heard an immense amount of
evidence. The evidence of the followingu
mentioned parties is arnong that whîchi
appe-ared in pratest against the then existing law and in support of what we have
befre us to-day in section 374 ai the Bill:
the ci.ty of Toranto, the Ontario Government, Mr. Lighthall, representing the Union
ckf Canadian Municipalities, and the HydraElectrie Power Commission nmade representations. W-hile I arn referring ta the
Hyd-ro-Electric, I want te make this point
emphatically. My honourable f riend wbo
moved the amendment <Hon. W. B. Rosa)
proposes that these coxapanies shalf have
the right ta go into municipalities without
let or hindrance and do wbat they please.

Hon.. 3ki. CLORAN: That is not democratic.
Hon. Mr. MAODONELL: No; and we
have had the Hydro-Electric paraded before us ad- nauseum. You 'would thînk
it was an Arabian nigaht's yarn, the story
cf Aladdin and bis lamp, Aladdin being in
the farn of Sir Adam Beck, and- that the
Hydro-Electrio had a mysteriaus way of
remaving campetitors and getting ail the
business. The Hydro-Electiic of the province of Ontario must get the consent af
the municipalities before entering, and before it can diatribute or seIl light or power
in any manner; and, in the second place,
it must afterwards have a by-law passed
by the peaple giving it financial aid-not
a maney payment, but a guarantee of a
certain ,amoun.t of money, which is the
equivalent of what they spend in in-stalling
the plant in the cammunity.

That is why we are here to-day.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: They ought to revise

'Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: A large number
oi other interees and practically ail the
conimunitbies i Ontario were represented
before that eommittee, to protest against
what this company was -and is doing, and
aIl in favour of the infertion of sect;on 374
which we are now oonsidering. The Ontario
Governrnent made a long and urgent appeal,
which je in wrilbing, and which, is part of
'the proceedings of the comrnittee, protesting
against this company. and urging the passage cl section 374 as it stands.

Hon. Mr. MAODONELL: In a nmoment I

an organization of their own. They appeared
here and protested against the Bill as it
stood, and advocated the Bill as it etands
before us to-day. The following cities of
Ontario were represented: Toronto, Chathami, Gait, Guelph, Hamnilton, Kitchener,

Milton West, Paris, Petrolea, Ridg-etown,

Hon. Mr. CLIORAN: Practically ail of
Ontario.
Hon. Mr. MAODONELL: Yes, practically
ail of Ontario, and they protested strongly
ag-ainst the Bill as it stood, and favoured
the amdendmnent as it now stands as section
374 of the Bill. I followed this matter very
ciosely. I have it very deep in rny heart,
because of public interest.
That is the
only interest that a have in the matter.
The select committee of the House of Commons heard the evidence, week ro and wveek
out, and decided by a rnajority of nine to
three to retain the clause as it now stands.
In Comrnittee of the Whole House of C'ommons it passed by a vote of 32 to 13, and
the report of the Committee was adopted;
Hon. -Mr. MACDONflLL.

in short, there was a majority for it of
about 3 to 1.
I should like to refer to, a remark made
by a member of the cornrittee. I think
it is entitled to very great consideration.
1 refer to Hon. 'Mr. Cochrane, then Minister of Railways, who, if I may say so, had
sleptwith this Bill for two or three years,
and was imbued with the spirit of it and
was thoroughly conversant with every section of it. 6everal honourable gentlemen
gave their rea sons for voting as they had
done. Those who voted against the section in the Bill endeavoured to make their
offence as light as possible. In supporting
the section, Hon. Mr. Cochrane gave this
as his justification:
My Justification for taking the position J. do
is that I think the PariAarnent of Canada did
wrong in giving the coenpany these powers.
They did an Injustice to the different imunicipaldties in the provinces of Canada, and I
think it is the duty of tihis Parliaznent to n-end
that wrong.

He doeés not say Ontaxio; he says Canada.
There is the whole matter in a nutshell.
If you were to argue from now to t.his day
next year, you could not have it put more
succinctly before honourable gentlemen.
TI-at is the story cf the Bill so far as the
Commons is conoerned.
Before I leave the question of the vanious intereats here represented, I may say
thiat 1 received, as apparently every other
honourable gentleman likewise did, a short
memorandum last week from the Union of
Canadian Municipalities, who were holding
a general meeting *at Ottawa on the 10th
of April.
They distributed a circular
w'hich contained the following:
Bill A, an Act te, consolidate and amnend the
Railway Act.
Resolution6 unanimous1y
adopted by the
executive committee of the Union of Canadian
F.Nlunicipalities, Ottawa, April 1Oth, 1918.

Then, the last clause but one savs:
Resoived unan-imously, that this union, after
due consideration, strongily supports the propcs'al of the City cf Toronto regarding section
37 4.

This resolution simply refers to Toronto
because that city took the leading part
with regard to this section, Ibecause it had
been smarting under the injustice of what
h-ad been done. J't was the city cf Toronto
that fir6t .brought this matter before the
select comrnittee of the Commons.
What
1 have read shows that I arn safe in saying
that ail the municipalities in Ontario which
have spoken are in favour of this section,
and thlat every public-spirited interest or
individua.1 desires it.

APIIIL 16, 1918
I desire niow to refer shortly to a inatter
of very great importance, and I arn prepared
to niake the staternent tliat, with the exception of the retroaetive feature fit the
end ef paragraph 5, the law as embodied
in this section is identical and ver'batim
with the- law that we have had in thie
country ever 'since we *had power coinpanties. I will endeavour to prove that
4.ateunent hy reading ex-tracte f rom the
etatutes. We are asking nothin-, new. The
Government of Canada presents this Bill.
It received the support of the Governmient
iii the Commons, and it cornes here as a
Governîment Bill, and it je in that aspect
that we are dealing with it. The Houée
of Gominons gave this Bill ample consideratien and sufficient aupport to ensure its
passage, and they are flot ccnnected with
anything that is revolutionary, atartling or
unfair. This section 374 ie simply a perpetuation of the general ]aw as it bas -been
heretofore, imaking it applicable to *this
company, whichi, undEr the decis1on o! the
Privy Councîl, bas escaped-a conipany
whicb ~s a law unto it.self, which cari buy
out expiring franchises and continue tite
business while it is profitable in perpetuity.
The Toronto Electric Light Company is a
pubhlie corporation distri-buting and eell!ng
light in the city of Toronto. It bas a
municipal franchise whieh ilh expire in
1919. The franchise was given to it by the
city cf Toronto, and an agreement was entered into in due form. This was a liberal
agreement to the con'pany, becauc-e it was
drawn scrne twen-ty or thirty years azo,
w-hen power and lighit companies were few
in xîum-ber and when their franchiseis iere
valuable and the cest of power high. As
I have said, this franchise will expire in
a yea r or two, and the reazoîî that the cit*
o! Toronto -becarne apprehiencive was, not
se much on account o! the wires and poles
which bhad been erected hy the coiinpany

that the aeneral nmanag«er of the Toronto
Electrie Liglit Cornpany had made a Etatement in t'le pulblic press-and 1 arn

and cont-inue it without leave or license,
and that they would be in a position te
continue perpetually becauce o! the fact
that the Toronto and Niagara Power Company had a perpetual- franchise under
which they could go anywhere without the

143

consent of ilie cornrnunity, and the game
%vould be c()ntx'nued as it had gene on
before. The city becaîne alarined because
the people believed, and they stili believe,
that an agreement bas been nmade by
which the expiring franchise o! the light
co-mpany will be continued iad infini.tum by
the Toronto and Niagara Pewer Comnpany;
and, unlese this retroactive feature in this
Bill has effect, they will do se. Let me
peint out that the retroactive feature is
simply aimed at prohibitoing the Toronto enid
Niagara Power Company fromn buying this
expiring franchise, and makes provision
for the protection of ail existing contracta,
and ail exist;ng lawful business that the
power company may have. Se that iL
would not kill the company's business, as
has been stated in the corridors- cf this
House. Nothing cf the kind would occur.
The drafteman cf the Gommons was careful
ta make provision-and 1 will refer to it
later-in subsection 4 of sectien 374, te
protect the exist.ing business of this cmxpany.
Now, I would like -to give a short resumé
cf the law on this point, in chronelogical
order, becauEe 1 think 'this section does
not ask anyth-.ng that is new. This section
.simpiy seeks te evade the conceequencea of
the decision of the Privy Council, which
wvas given on techinical grounds, and wvhich
reversed the judgnient of the -Ceurt cf
Appeal cf' Ontario, and gave a perpetual
franchise, noxwithstanding the fact that the
general Act provided general safeguards.

At that timne t.he Railway Act of
1899 waS in force. It was chapter 37 of that
year. 'Section 1 is as iollows:

Then, sdibsection 2, as it applied from,

Hon. Mr. BOSTOOR: What is the honourable gentleman reading?
Hon. Mr. MÂODONELL: The Do,minion statute of 1899, chapter 37.
Now, even at that remote date, they iad no

Act incorporating this cornpany gives thein
power not only ta do thjat but ta take easu'ments and other riahts over private property. Suppose any honourable gentleman
in this House had a home in the city, the
company have a right ta put tîheir 'wires or
pales across bis praperty under the guise
af what is legally knawn as an easement.
They can do that; but away back in 1899
they were prohi'bited framn doing it. Sa
that when they got their charter in 1902 the
general law said that they could not enter
a catumunity without the consent, by bylaw. of a municipal caunicil or other authority.

(Hon. Mr. Béique) very properly raised te
point that any conr'tittee or the committee of the Whole of this Senate should bc
gu ided by the Act of 1809, for reasons 1 %vil!

.ive later. Then, the general Ac' cf 1906
came along in due course and provision
is made there in the samne termis as in the
Act cf 1899, requiring the consent cf the
m-unicipal-ity before the company wauld
have the rig.ht ta enter a community and
sellijts power. 1 have the statute here, but
it is the general Revised Statute cf 1906
where the -whole law is consalîdated and
made very ample and very plain. That law
in the Act of 1906 is continued up ta date.
and it makes plain twa things, transmissien and distribution. and makes provision
for appeal te the railway board where
transmission is unreasonably denied by a
municipality, and provides that a community is master in its own home, in reference'
ta distribution or sale, and that ne comnpany shall be allowed ta caine in there
without the consent cf the cammunity obtaiiied by by-law. I stated that seme littie
time &go mnanager Fleming, cf the Toronto
Electric Light Company, hiad stated thnt
that company was selling or can'templating
selling out te the Torento and Niagara
Power Company, the light company having
a perishable franchise while the power coinpany had a permanent franchise. Particulars of that statement will be found in this
extract fromn the Star newspaper of Tarante,
dated Januarv 26, 1917, shawing that Mr.
Fleming made a public stateinent to that
effect. The statement is reported as folla>wa:
Tarante a village-'manager Fleming iaukhs at
city and pralses Providence.
General Manager R. J. Fleming l)ositively
affirmed Thursday that the charter rights of the
Toronto Power Company give te themn the poNver
ta erect pales, etc., in any municipality, in the
province and to distribute poNver ta any place
v,jtiiin the province.
Asked if the Privy Council judgment against
the Toronto Electrlc Light Company was a-s
good as an arder te take the poles off the streets.
the manager stated that it was. Asked ta explain
the situation, the manager said: " The judgment
of the Privy Council Nvas against the Toronto

wbcreby they were perrnltted to distribute power.

on our side, because, you know, you wouldn't
expeet a village to be allowed to stand in the
way of a great distrtibution systern upon which
millions have been spent.
-"You are flot comparing Toronto xvith a village are you ?" said the reporter. "Wby not?
the principle is the same. Some six or seven
years ago when. we wvere erecting poles uI)of
North Bathurst street. the city took exception,

and the case went to the Privy Council.

The

Privy Cou-ncil then sald that wve had rights
under the charter of the Toronto Power Comnpany, and the city knows that as well as we
do."
"Then you claim that the Toronto Power
Company has a blanket charter to go Into any
nmunilclPality and erect pales in the province of
Ontario."
" Why, <,ertainly we have the right
to distribute power to any place In the province,
and, of course, the power te erect poles."
'Put It this way," said the general manager,
'wlhen the city; In a moment cd reeentment,

city took power from us, and "-e spent millions
of dollars to provide power at a 10w rate, and"-the manager's eyes twlnkled-" then very unlclndly the clty says: * We have entered the
business, get off the streets.'
New that isn't
fair, and so yau Bee Providence bas lnterv-ened,
and we are able to continue the great wark af

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: 1 would liketo ask
the honourable gentleman if the city of Toronto has the first option to buy out the
Toronto Electric Light Company.
Hon. Mr. MAODONELL: Yes, that is quite
true. The city of Torontmo has, the power to
huy the plant and assets 0f the Toronto
Electric Light Company if they do not renew it on its expiry in a year or two; ibut
what they are apprehensive of and what
has been stated publicly is that the light
comfpany will probably seli te the power
company before their time expires, and
leave the city of Toronto without any rnea'ls
of redress except that contained within the
four walls of a naked barren act.on at law,
and I do not know what their relief would
pe;- but if the light company selis its whole
equipment and all its plant to the power
companly, there would flot be anv-thing for
it to sell to the city of Toronto wvhen their
franchise runs out in one or two years.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: They have the
authority to do that hefore the expiry o4 the
franchise?
Hon. Mr. MACODONELL:,I would -not like
to say deifinitely, for I doo not know; but
thait Mtaternent was made before the committee, and Mr. Fleming-, the manager,

practically makes it in the item here mentioned.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: 1 would like to ask
the honourable gentleman il the retroactive
clause affects the rights of the bo.ndholders?
Hon. 'Mr. MACDONELL: I arn very glad
my honourable friend has 'called my attention to that. I will endeavour to, be as
frank with that as with everything else, and
if I may be permitted, although a recexit
member of your honourable body, I will be
only too glad if any honourable gentleman
wîll ask any question on any leature oxfthîs
matter that I arn able to answer, and I will
do so as frankly and faithfully as I possibly can. I would answer the honourable
gentleman in this way: In the first place,
-there is a knot or neat of companies-the
Toronto Railway -Company, the Toronto
Electric Light Company, the Toronto Power
Company, the Electric Developrnent Company, the Toronto and Niagara Power Company, and, 1 thiiik, others-that are inextricably interlocked, and they are ahl under
practically one management. No one can
tell what is going on béhind the footlights,
becoause, they are ail under one oegis or
syotem, or management, by which they exchange their power rights, and one does the
developing work, another the transmitting.
another the financing,, and so on. No mani
from a public point of view can ascertaîn
their relative positions or conditions. However, with reference to the bonds, last seseion before this committee Mr. Beck, a celebrated' New York lawyer, was here, reprEsentinga the Toronto & Niagara Power Company, and there were many other lawyers
and witnesàes present that day, and a good
rnany honourable gentlemen; and, as our
small committee roomn would not accommodate them, we inoved into this Chamber
during the morning. Mr. Beck was supporting the power co>mpany, and was antagonistic to the public clauses. He was
here as a paid counsel-I do not object
to that in the least; but he represented
the companies here, and made the statement that there were bonds outstanding
to the amount of sonie $35,000,000 or
$36,'000,000--d thinli he said of this company or led the people to believe it was
this company. 1 knew that was impossible.
Dc.ubtless there is a large amount of bonds
issued by this whole group of companiPe
collectively-issued and held either individually or collectively. But later in the evening Mr. Osier of Toronto, a lawyer of the
higileat possible reputation there, appeared
here as representing the Empire Trust
Company, I 'think, or some trust company

that held the bonds issued by the Toronto
and Niagara Power Company-the company
we are aiming at to-day-and 1 asked hini
the total issue of bonds that had been
made by the Toronto and Niagara Power
Company, and he said ene and a half millions. I asked him about stock, and he
said it was ei'ther $850,000 or $860,000, or
thereabouts.
1 suppose that stock went
with the bonds; but there was their total
sccurities issue. 1 arn no expert ýDn power
companies, or the value of their asses; but
tney have en immense transmission line;
I think it is 100 fret wide from Niagara
F'alls ta Toronto-in fact, including North
Toronto; and they have a very large equipment; and I should say the outside ameunt
of their securities is prebably trifling cernpared with their assets. ln order to keep
their assets good, the Commons inserted ini
this very clause a sub-clause protecting
their present and existing work and bargr.ins and agreements in selling their
power. Bo tha-t to say that the bondholders
woul1d lose anything if this legislation
passed is a bugaboo of the very worst kind,
because the bonds are, I believe, small compared with their assets. -Mr. Osier emphâsized that in one or two ways when 1 pressed him. He .said that the whole bonds they
had issued were a rn!lion and a hall, with
îl-me, eigit hundre.1 thousand odd dollars
of stock; I do not kniow whether the stock
was ever paid for or net.
Hon. Mr. MeSWEENEY: Two millions
altogether.
Hon. Mr. MAC1DYONELl,: Somiewhat more
than two millions altegether. Mr. Beck had
given the impression in the merning that
fiem $35,000,000 to $36,000,000 had beeni
issued. 1 do not tbink he did it wilfully
or knowingly wrengfully.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE: But there are
sûme vested rights?
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: Yes.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE: Are we neot
called upon to decide the-se points? Some
years ago this 1'arliament gave a charter
te a company te pass through municIpalities
without the permission of these municipalities. Now, are we flot asked (o decide
that this company or some other company
is poing to be deprived of th. Tight? [s
that flot the only question te -be decided?
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: This one cornpa.ny.

One company or rnany companies? Clause 374 s.ays

MUr.MAODONIDLL.

without their consent, but they will be deprived of that right by rthis legisltation.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: No.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE: That às the
question I asked. Am 1 mistaken in eaying
th-at aocording te a law -passed by this Parliament a certain ccernpany or coinipanies
have been authorized to pass, through
municipaliies witheuit their coinsent?
Hoa. Mr. MACDONELL:

No, no.

Hon. Mr. OHOQUÈTTE: Are we not
under clause 374, taking away this right,
given ta any~ company te go thzough. municipalities without their consent? If so, are
they vested rights? If they are, are we
geing ta do away with themP It is for the
honourable gentleman ta convince us that
there are no veated rights. There je saniething in the last point he m.ade, but thet is
the questioni.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: I would be o>nly
tee happy 4,o explain if the honourable genitleman will follow me for a moment. I
repeat that the power comipany does two
thingas-really three things: it generates
power, then Attransmits power. With regard
te tihe right ta go through muniicipalities,
the municipality is -consulted -as tio whether
it. sha. permit the power company ta psis
through or net. -and if the municipality
says no, then the company goes at once ta
the railway commission. That has always
been the L.w, a uniforma law, and it is the
saine law te-day; and this section proeerves
in perpetuity that right te this cempany,
and it lias the same relief.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But the judgment of the Privy Council has gene further;
it has all&wed themn the right te distribute.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: Yes. Then the
ihii-d feature of a poywer cempa.ny's operatiens is the distribution. Now with regard
te that, the general l.aw of Canada, and
every private Act that was ever given te a
power cempany, except that of this Toronte
and Niagara Company, ias always contained a prehibitien against the distributien or se]ling of power in a com4mu3nity
uinless the community censents. The general law of the country has always, since
power cempanies started, contained suoh a
clause, and every Act that was ever passed
witheut sucli a clause has 'been amended
since bhy the insertion of such a clause,
except the Act ef this company.

ýI %vouldlike just to refer Io a few c1auses
the preêent Bill

vhîicli \e bave passed

APRIL 16, 1918
and m-hich contaixi retroactive language. I
refer to this inatter simiply to inake it
plain that this is not an exceptional clause
and that there are a large nuniber of clauses
of a like nature in the very Bill now going
through. Section 1,33. subsection 4, is expressly retroactive. It refers to securities
pledged for boans. In a sense ail restrictions of existing companies may be termed
retroactive. In section 2, subsection 28:
"Special Act meana an Act heretofore or
hereafter passed." Section 5 makes the
.Act apply to com'panies -"heretofore o-r
hereafter incorporated.- In section 259 the
board may apportion coast of work - notwithstanding anything in this Act or in
any other Act." The "other Act" imay
have been passei years ago. In -section
373, the clause im-mediately preceding the
present one, suibsection 2, the restrictions
re 'telegraph and telephone wires on highways were 'pased -"notwith
standing any
Act," etc. In section 376, the very next
section to the one we are considering,
subsection 2 contains the words, "notwithstanding anything in any Act heretofore
pasaed ;- it refera to telephone tolls bringing
themn under the general Act. Section 316,
subeection 7, and section 365, subsection 1,
tsiken together, provide that -"agreements
contrary to these sections are void." The
agreements may have been miade long ago.
I wilI not elaborate argument or encumber
thie discussion further.
H-on.*LMr. DAVID: If I undierstand the
honourable gentleman's contention, it la
that the retroactive clause has the effect of
placing the parties in the position they were
in wben the charter was granted to the
comparly.
Hon. Mr. MACDIONELL: It is more
coiprehensive than even that. It is a
broad sweep. No matter when these Acta
were passed, they are deait with by these
sections.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: But, in other ternis,
the retroactive clause gives effect to the
agreement which was made, to the understanding which was arrived at in the House
of Commons, when the charter was granted.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: It may be that
the retroactive clauses give effect to it or
they cancel it; but the point I am taking
is not the individual case, but the principle of retroactive legisiation.
I could enlarge upon what took place in
the House of Common, Committee cf the
Whole whien the Bill.of 1902 was passed, but
I do not desire to do so. The Bill was passed
and the conipany wvas given its charter upon

the basis of the statements ruade by Mr.
Cowan, the chairmnan of the comimittee, and
Mr. Pringle, that thp conipany was bound
by the generai Act and by ail the safeguards
which were then in the general law or might
thereafter be passed; whereas their lordshipa of the Privy Council held that under
section 21 of the Special Act o! this conipany-a most skilfully worded, a most
cleverly dra-wn clause--ail the force and
effect o! ail the general public Acta were
nulI and void *with reference to this, conipany, whicb had a special right of its own,
a sort of divine right as of kings to al] the
.powers that were given theni, and were not
bound or governed in any way by the geineral
Acta, either those, which had been passed be.
fore the oompany got its charter in a9M, or
by subeequent legielation. This is a nice condition for thes-people in sny British community to, be face to face with: the principle that no matter what Parliament ever
did-for if it applies to company legialation it applies also to all other legisiationit can neyer be undone by Parliament; it
cannot be questioned nor repealed, nor can
any new law be substituted for it. Every
la-wyer in this House is well aware of the
principle upon which the courts deal with
reacinded legislation. If an Act is, rescinded
and a new Act is put in its place the courts
interpret the company as being bound by
the srirbstituted or new Act ini place of the
old one that bas been iepealed, and il there
la no new Act, if the old Act la abolished
governing any company or set of companies,
then the courts deterniine that the old Act
stands, revived for the purpose of compeiling thie company to comply with its ternis,
notwithstanding that it bas been, generally
speaking, abrogated, or repealed. The courts
Hnd the legisiatures -of every British cininunity deal with niattýers past anid present
according to the publie ne-eds and desires,
according to the fairness of the case.
Now, I would refer briefly to what took
place in this House when the Toronto and
Niagara Power Company's Bill was before
the Senate. The discussion, which took
place on the third reading o! the Bill, is
reported in the Senate Debatea of 1902, at
page 407, as follows:
Hon. Sir Alphonse Pelletier, frein the Coinmittee on railwaya, telegrapha and har<bours,
reported Bill 100, an Act to incorporais the
Toonto andi Niagara Power Comnpany.
Hon. Mr. Kirchhoffer nioved the suspension
of rule 70 in ao far aa the same relates to ljhis

Thiat was ini order to have il g-iven a third

the reporting of a Bill and the third reading-. The report continues:
ýHon. 'Mr. Beicue-1 desire to eali attention
-tc the f-act that in this Bill reference ia made
te clause 90 of the Railway Act, as being incorporated in the Bill, and clause 90 states a
great number of things which may be done by
the company. But section 91 and the foiiowing
section state how these things &hall be done
and how the compensation shouId be paid. antd

*says that the company in doing its work shall
do as little diamage as possible, and section 92
rphese
Ithat they shahl pay any damage done.
Itwo sections should form part of the Bill and
should be mentioned in the Act as being incorporated under clause 90; otherwisc the
oeapany would take power to do these, severai
things, and .be reieved trom paying damages.

Hon. Mr. Kirchhoffer stated that he proposed leaving for home that night and
wisbed the Bih read s third time before
l-eaving
'
lion. Mr. Younig hiere suggested that the
motion of Senator Kirchboffer be passed
and Senator Béique could bring up the
matter on the third reading.
The motion to suspend the rules was
asreed te, whereupon Hon. Mr. Kirchhoffer moved the third reading of the Bill.
Then, the report sayýs:
Hon. Mr. Beique-I niove that clause 90 of
the Bill be amended by adding atter the words
"section 91," the two sections, nametlY 91 and

Section 91 " is evidently a mnisprint 'or
-eetion 90," because section 90 was refýerred
to and is the one in the .Act. Senator Béique
evidently rnoved -that this safegauarding
clause be put in. Hon. Mr. Kirchhoffer
would nlot consent to any amendmient -being

Now, this Bill allows any transmission
company to carry its line througb any
municipality in Canada on condition that
the company obtains the consent of the
municipality through which it is desired
ta pass. But there is a rider to the Statute
which provides that if the company cannot
obtain the consent of the municipality, 'the
company may go to the railway board.
Some little township hying in the direct
path which the company proposed to take
niight hold tbem up, it might wish to exact
unfair conditions, and if there was no
appeal to the railway board, that township could compel a company te grant it
favours te whîch it was net entitled; therefore the riglt of appeal to the railway
board is provided.

Hon. '.%r. BEIQUE: Provided that vou

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-ýSTAUNTON: No court
in Ontario has power to enjoin a company
fronu selling. Under the iaw of Ontario tlue
only remedy that a man has for breach of
contract to seil property, excepting- real
property, is an action for damag-es. If I
agree to seli real property, and you have not
regaistered the agareement in the registry
office, then 1 may sell, and your remedy is
against me personally. That is my whole
case.
1 have no interest in this question
outside
of trying

My proposition is that
if th e Toronto Electric Ligaht Comnpany, having- agreed to seli to the
city of Toronto, seli this property to any
other buyer, secretly or otherwise the
property passes to the buver, and the only

remiedy that the city has is an action for

Company. To-miorrow-%the peopleof Toronto

passed away, and ail they could do would
be to sue the Toronto Electric Lig-ht Coanpany for daniages. Now, if il had been

APRIL 16, 1918
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: 1 ihink,
*he honourabie gentleman will agrée with
nie that no mani can bring an action againct
another man until the time arrives %vhiea,
under the agreernent, the property is to be
Iianded over. They could no mnore do that
than I could to-day sue a man on a note
which would be due a year hence- The
point is that there is nothing to prevent t.he
ctrnpany frorn seliing this property now.
For instance, I own a house, and 1 agree
to seil it to John Smnith in the beginning
of 1920. John Srni-th cannot bring an action
against me before 1920 to compel me to seli
that house. The only Nvay he can protect
-himiself under our law would be to register
the agreement; but there is no power to
register such an agreement as this.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Why not?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAU-NTON: Thiere is
no law for it. It is not rea-1 property, it is
personal property. Th.at question lias been
decided by the Privy Council hiaif a dozen
times.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: An action for
specific performance with an injunction
would mighty soon put -the corporation
beyond the possibilîty of deairig with t.he
property.

Hon. Mr. LYN-CH-STAUNTON: No; an
action for spécifie performance cannot be
brougýht, and no injunction wouid 'be
gran ted by any courts in Ontario. If the
Senate is in doubt about that, take the
opinion of the iaw officers of the Crown. I
auj not advocating, anything here; I arn
only giving my view as a senator. I have
no interest in t;his matter on one side or
the other, and I will not vote to deprive
this company of arny rigbt at ail; but I will
not vote to allow the Toronto Electric Lighît
Company to be guilty of any violation of
their contract with the city of Toronto. So,
;f I arn wrong i n mv view, and if an opinion
is brought here fromi the Departrnent, of
Justice showving that I arn wrong, tbeii I
arn quite willing to withdraw the proposit;on that I amn goig to make t.o thiis Senate.
lion. Mr. BEIQUE: Does not thie Toronto
Electric Lighit Company own a power bouse
as part of its plant?
Hon. '.\r. LYNCH-STA1TNTON:. 1 do not
k'now.
Honi.- Mr. BEIQI'E: Thiey own a power
hiouse. and, tliat being so, surely it is real
est ate.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAENTON: I understanl flint the Tor-onto iElectrie .L'lt CÇço-

pany does not develop any power at ail, but
thiat thiey buy their power froîn the transrnîsîon cornpany which brings it from Niagara. Whien 1 say that their plant is tiot
real esta-te, it is because we had this. question threshed out in the Bell Telephone
Comnpany cases for taxation purposes, and
in all the litigation with which I was connected. for themn their -wires and poles and

their plant erected in the city were decided
to be personal property. The city owns the
groun d; they own the poles that are stuck
in the ground, and îhey have no power
house. If the company have a power bouse
certainly it is real estate; -but the city of
Toronto does not care anything about the
power house. The city of Toronto wants
to prevent.the power cornpany from buying
from the people who have promised to seli
to the city of Toronto, and who have erected
a plant for distri'bution, which. is in the

,city's streets. That is the point, and no
honourable gentleman can delend the Toronto Electric Light. Company for doing- a

thing which would make them guilty of a
gross fraud on the city of Toronto if it were
carried out.

Now, what I sugagest to the committee is
this, that instead of the retroactive clause
in the Act, which is cîbjectionable,' a clause
should be inserted similar to this, wvhich I
drew out -%hile sitting here and listening
to the honourable inember from Toronto
Macdonell)-the phraseology
(Hon. M1%r.

gentlemen Nviil get the substance of it fromn

do flot think the honourable gentlemen-I
say ià with great respect-are quite seized
of the situation. The Toronto Electrie Light
Company does not want to sell; that company rwould like f0 get an extension for

Hon. Mr. LYNOH-STAUNTON:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: W'hy do they not
send the company their notice now
Hon. Mr. LYNOIR-STAUNT-ON:
They
cannot do it until the Urne le up, which is
1919. They can only do it according to
their barguain. If this arnendment is sent
f0 a sub-committee, they can have the agre-ments and ail the facts before themi. It ig
sometimes said, "The lady doth protest
too miuch;". but I protest here that if it
is shown that nîy apprehension of the facts
la not correct I will withdraw this amendnment. 1 arn 6uggesting this only rwith one
view-so that they wili flot take away from
this compa.ny their rights, and wili not depTive Toronto of what it has bargained for.
That position seems to me eminently fair.
Hon. Mr. BEIQIJE: I suppose the hionourabie gentleman wouid be satisfied if the
Toronto Electric Light Cornpany were consen ting- to amend thie agýreement with the
city of Toronto lu sucb a w.ay that thev
would have no power f0 6eil in violation of
their ag-reernent.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAIJNTON: Oh, yes,
if they hiad no poNer to sell iii violation of
that ag-rernent I %vouid not tender f0 the

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:
That could be
done wvith the consent of Parliarnent.

Hon. W. B. ROSS: If the city of Toronto
bas rights that are weli known td ail those
comipanies with special charters, and if the
latter buy the Toronto Eiectric Light Conioanv with a contract outstanding under
which the city of Toronto has rights, they
on'y get into the position of the Toronto
iectric Light Company. If it was a secret
agreement if wouid be different.
lion. Mr. LYNCH-ST iAUNTON: H-onourable gentlemen here have spoken about
interfering with vested rights,, injuring our
credit abroad, doing us financial wrong In
the markets of the rworld. But, if a man
goes to New York or London, and some
one whio sees is conitract says, " Oh. weli,
soniebody wiil go down to Ottawa and get
an Act of Parlianient that wîll deprive you
of that right," wouid that not affect our
credit? The duty and business of tPariiament is to protect the property cf every
person who lias a right to demand protcction at the hands of Parliamerit. Therefore
I will not vote for any retroactive legislation, but I will not vote foq, any legislati.oîî
that is going te hielp any company seeking
te get the advantage of any municipality
of Canada.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I would like to ask
the honourable gentleman if there is a
fine or a word in section 374 as proposed
by me that prevents any egrnpany or any
city or any municipaiity from asserting
any rigbht it has to the full in the courts
of the country?
Honi. iMr. LYNCH-STAUN'TON: I tbink

so that it may be ascertained whe-ther the
isets whia' I have stated -are quite correct
or -not.
Hon. Mr. McHUGH: 1 have listened
with a good deal of attention to ail thaït
has been said on this question. I was for a
considerable tiie last vear a member of
the conmittee before whonu tisç matter was
threshied out. 1 do flot know whetlier my
understanding of it is correct or flot; î
have flot a leg-al mind, and do nlot follow
such miatters as legal members of the Hous.e
do; but my understanding from a layman's
point of vjew is thiz: The Toronto and Nia1
gara P ower Comnpany, whien it was incor.porated. got certain rights, but flot the
right: to distribute Power in the city of
Toronto, nor the righlt to place poles on the
streetis of Toronto. When the Toronto
Electric Power and Light Company got a
charter, they wvere granted rights of transmission in Toronto and the right to place
poles in the city streets; but those were
privileges which could be terrninated, if the
company's franchise were purchased by
the city of Toronto. at the end of 30 years.
But the Toronto aud Niagara Power Corn-

pany. whicli had not those righlts, amalganiated writh this conipany, wise rig-lts
were teriniable, and now seeks by this
amnalgamnation, by the interlocking of the
different companies, to impose upon the
city of Toronto a claim to a perpetual right.
WVhen the Toronto Electrie Light Company
was granted the privilege of transmitting
power and placing poles in the streets of
Toronto, which was a terminable right, the
people of Toronto offered no opposition to
an agreement being made which. they supposed would be terminable at the end of
30 years. Now, if my understanding of this
inatter is correct, I do not think the Senate
ought to be a party to allowing a company
or a set of companies, by any interloc'dig
or switching of powers frorn one to another.
to do the municipalities of Canada an
injustice. If I amrn ft
placing the righit
construction upon this matter, I should like
to be put right. I arn gîving the inipression which I have formed freim the
evidence 'placed before the coninittee b ',
3
the various witnesses, and from the statements made by honourable members. I
do not want to see the Toronto Electric
Light Comnpany permitted to make a transfer te the Toronto and Niaga:ra Power Coinpany, by interlocking or amalgamation,
which would leave the city of Toronto
nothing to take over at the end of 30 years.
If the Toronto and Niagara Power .Comupany
can by .this amalgamation corne into
Toronto and place poles and transmit
poweT in the city, then the city will have
nothing, to take over frorn the Toronto
Electric Light Comnpany.
At six o'clock the cornrittee took recesz.
The coxnmittee resumred a! eiht o'clock.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: During the recess I
have hiad prepared an anodent for giving effect to the suggestion made by' the
honourable inember fromn Hamnilton (Hon.
Mr: Lynch-$taunton), which is to this
effeet:

SENATE

'fhere has heen placed in my hand a draft
of another amendment, which would be to
the same effect, and. 1 would have no objection to accepting this second draft, which
would merely add to the end of subsection 5
the following words:
Provided aiways t.hat whenever any
com Pany inSerporated by a special Aet of the
Parliament of Canada acquires the assets of a
distribution company operating within the
amiipaity, wtiioh said municWp.Lty bias the
rig'ht by agreement to purchase the assets of
auch distribution ompany, then and In every
msdi Ca" the r4ghts so aoqired shall be preserved to the municipaltty in accordance witb
thbe terms of t-be said o4reeinent.

I think this would be Vo the same effect,
and I would have no choice between the
two.
~Hon. W. B. ROSS: 1 would prefer the
honourable gentleman to take the last.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: 1 have no objection.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Does that take the
place of the arnendment of the hionouraible
member from Hamilton?
Hon. Mr. WATSON: That is the amendment.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: I arn quite wiiling Vo
accept that.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: 1 do so, subject to
comingu back to s'ubsection 4, until we dispose o! section 5.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: These two
aniendinents are proposed without notice
given. lit was quite impossible Vo follow the
honourable member when hie was proposing
technical amendments Vo the Bill. It 'vas
imposible either WofoUlow the language or
to understand its effect.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: This is the last aniendmient, if you care to see it.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: There is aný
arnendment before the Chair now. 1 would
suggest that the committee might delay
further action on the section until the
honourable member froin Hamilton return,
and we can dispose of his amendment, aid
possibly consider all these amnendments iogether.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: 1 understand this is
carrying out the idea o! the honourable
miemxber from Hamilton.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: I do not knom'
whether it is or not.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

suhbsection 5, whereas we have flot disposed,
o! the others. Doubt'ess the honourable
gentleman from Hamilton will be here before we reach number 5.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Speaking Vo this
arnendment of the honourable senator froin
Middleton (Hon. W. B. Ross), I consider
that it is along the right lines. I have
very great objection Vo the clause in the
Act as it stands. As bas already been
pointed out thîs afternoon, clause 374 as it
stands enacts retroactive legisiation, a thing
which I think this Parliament should not
do. It is a most serions matter for us Vo be
afftecting the rights o! companies that have
been in existence for a great many years,
which rights have been exercised in accordance with the charters given Vo them by
this Parliament. For tha't reason 1 arn very
much opposed Vo that clause. Then also,
as 1 understood the argument of the hionourabe gentleman froin Hamilton this
afternioon, the cornpany with which it is
proposed Vo deal under this clause is a coinpany incorporated under the laws o! the
province of Ontario. The Niagara Power
Company obtained a charter from this Dominion; but, if 1 understand tlhe position
rightly, the Toronto Electric Light Company
obtains its po'wers from the province of Ontario; and that company's agreement with
the city o! Toronto, with which we are now
trying to deal, was made un-der powers
given Vo the company by the province. I
quiL&e think that as far as possible the city
of Toronto should be protected in any hionourable deaing of that kind that it made
wi'th the company, and I cani hardly understand that any company would want Vo
avoid carrying out an agreement which,
!rorn the statements made this afternoon
by the honourable member !rom Hamnilton,
it is quite evident they should carry out.
But the question is 'whether it is ri ght for
this Parliament to bie dealing with this matter in this way. it seems to me very objectionable that we should deal wjth a matter
of this kind in a genýeral Railway Act. If
the Government were satisled thatthis matVer should be deait with by this Parliament,
a special Act should have been prepared,
and we could then have gone in-to the whole
question properly and thoroughly. Legislation should not be passed in a generai
Aot when it is for the purpose o! correoting
sorie particular matter .affecting only one
part of the country, without reference to
the way in which it mnay affect other parts
o! this Dominion and other compandeýs. I
think such legislaV.ion is very objectionable.
We ought to be careful that such leg-islation

APRIL 16, 1918
is for the benefit of the Whole country, -and
net aimed ait any particular corporatixon or
any particular charter that bas already been
grianted by this Parliarnent. Therefore, on
account of the retroactive features in tb.is
clause, I -am very etrongly in 4avour of the
arnendrnent proposed by the honourable
gentlemn from Middletou. As far as I amn
personally concerned, I would waive my
objections ta dealing with special legisiation in this way if we could. get over tbiia
present difficulty, because I realize that
this matter bias been before Parliarent for
some considerable time, and thstt it has
been very keently contested by the
parties
particul-arly
interested in- it.
Therefore, to, that extent I think poseibly
the froposed arnendsnent of my honour-able
friend from Middlèton (Hon. W. B.. Rosa)
may be along the right Uine. I understand
that t.his amendrnent bas practically been
agreedI to by aIl parties, and it seems to
carry out the views of. my honourable friend
fromr Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton).
At the sane. time ýI mnust register a proteet
against this kîind cf legisiation. To go into
this matter clearly and distinctly, we ought
to have all the information, before us. It
is, not the business of Parliament to go into
ail the detailsý, such as the question of the
agreement between the city of Toronto and
the Toronto Electrie Company. That question ought to be settled ini, some other way.
But for the purpose of arriving at some
conclusion in ýthis matter, I arn prepared to
waive my objection to tha.t. As this, is, a
very much diseu&sedL question throughout
the country, I should like to know whaît tny
honourable friend the leader of the Government in this Chamber bas to say with
regard to -the matter. I think that we ought
to hear from hlm.
Hon. Mr. DA.NIEL- I &hould like to ask
the h<n<>urable gentleman a question. He
spoke- of an7 agreement. Where can that
agreement -be lound? I have heard and
seen several referenees to it, but I have
flot yet s.een this agreement. I do, fot know
where it can be found. Gan -the bonouraible
gentleman tell me where it ca.n be found?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I ami. in exactly
the same position as the bonourable gentieman.*I have heard the agreement mentioned
on several occasions, but I have neyer had
an opportunity of exami.ning it. The honcurable gentleman from i ~arilton (Hon ."
Mr. Lyncli-Staunton) -referred ta iA th:s
afternoon.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I think that agreement should be placed on the table of the
House so that we could examine it.

Hton. Sir jAMES LOUGHEED: Honoura.ble gentlemen, my honourable friend has
made to me a very proper suggestion, and
1 have no hesitation. in etating rny attitude
upon this question. It may seem so'mewhat
anomalous that I, having charge cf the -Bill,
should not be in harmony with this particular section. When the Bill came hefore
Parliament last session I reserved the right
to, differ from iy colleague& in the Cabinet
as ta the desirability of emtbody-ing this
section in the Act. I have beenl in Parliament a great num-ber of years., during which
time I have been a member of Senate; and
if the Senate of Canada, bas étood for anything, it has stood for the protection of
vested rights 'when there was no evidence
that the public interest was abused by the
exercise of tho»se rights.
It seeira to, me that this section was
passed by the special committee in the
ommons without due consideration being
given ta its effect. When the Bill was firat
prepared, the adoption of this legislation
wvas not in contemplation at alI; but when
the Bill went before the committee, apparently a very large delegation from Ontario waited upon the minister who had
charge of the Bill and were heard by the
committee, with the resuit that this legislation was imported, into the Bill. The unwisdom or the impolicy o.f this has now

friend from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Macdonell),
who made a very lucid speech upon the
question this afternoon. and also my honourable friend from Hamnilton (Hon. Mr.
Lynch-Staunton), who recited the various
complications which are in controversy in
the city af Toronto and in the province cf
Ontario, touched on this question. Tehe
very references whieh they made to the
complexity cf the situation on account of
the interlocking of the many companies
which are associated with oe another in
carrying on the undertakings upon which
they have entered, furnished ta this House
the very best evidence of the impolicy of
the House of Cominons in adopting, thia
legisiation last session, without having a
due knowledge of what they were doing,
for the purpose of meeting the clameur
which apparently had been raised in Ontario. Will my honourable friands who
are supporting the section as iL appears,
in the Bill contend for a moment that it
is the duty of Parliainent, upon the ex
parte reprasentations of delegations who,
may wait upon them, ta settle matters
that have required the very best attention
of the higchest courts in the realm?« From
the very statament cf the case mnade this

160 .SENATE
afternoon. it ýmust be apparent ta every
honourable gentleman in this Chamber
that it would require the closest possible
attention of the highes-t courts that we have
in Canada ta deal with the problems
o! the situation which have been autlined.
Furthermore. we are dealing with a matter wvhich bas already been dealt with by
the Privy Council, the highest court in
the realm. We are taking the judgment
af that court upon this subjeot, and we
are setting it upD that we may reverse it.
Sa- far as the rights o! the companies are
involved in the question, we are askedwithout any evidence before us o! thoýse
agreements or af the situation exce'pt thp
by
bald statements which are made
delegations and others who feel a degree of
animorsity ta the campany-we are 'asked
ta interiere with the vested rights which
Par1iamnt deliberately gave ta this coinpany in 1902. These have been con.firmed
by the Privy Counicil. and on the strength
of them -financial obligations repr-esentingfifteen or sixteen millions o! money have
been entered into by these companies. And
'with one wave o! the hand we are asked ta
wipe out these very important rights.
Now, I amrnfot saving that this company
is flot unpopular in the province af Ontario,
particularly in the city cd Taranto.- On the
ccntrary, I fancy that such is the case. I
arn not saving anvthing in vindication af
the campany. Ail I arn stating ta this
henourable body is what I regard ta be the
principle that we have always cansistently
observed, namely, that we should not interfere with the vested rights of corporations
which have been g-ranted by this Parliament, even notwithstanding what public
opinion may be on the suhject. As I have
already stated. if the Senate o! Canada
stands for any'thing it must stand as a bulwark against the clamor and the agitation
and the caprice o! the public upon ail such
questions as this.. If the second chamber.
which is flot answerable ta the electors,
cannot take that position and cannot stem
the pressure of agitation which is brought ta
bear upon the House of Commons, the
popular chamber, in passing legisiation o!
this kind, there is no place in Canada for
a second chamber. It seems ta me that this
is an Occasion when this chamber should
ass.ert the pninciples which it has asserted
ever since Confederation, and which, &o far
as I know, have neyer been violated in such
a way as la proposed under section 374.
What are the facts. honourable gentlemen? I shaîl deal with the hroad principle;
I arn not g-oing into ail the complexities of
law and facts. The broad facts are that
Hon. Sir JA.\LES LO'UGll=E.

the province of Ontario la committed to the
Hydro.Electric system of that province.
That system undoubtedly stands as a monument to the enterprise, flot only of the Ontario Government. but of those originally
as.sociated with it in furnishing electricity
and power to the people of that province.
That corporation, -because I shall refer to
it as such, has become interlooked with hl1
the municipalities of the province of Ontario. The Provincial Gavernment of OnLanao and the municipalities have become
sinterlocked with each other that the
interests of one are the interests of the
other and the interests of ail. I think that
can scarcely be disputed. The province of
Ontario, for the purpose of protecting itself
in the financiali obligations which it has
assumed in connection with that enoninous
undertaking, and for the purpose, undoubtedly, of preventing companies that
have been organized under Dominion legislation, bas passed legisiation forbidding. the
municipalities of Ontario, without the
consent o! the province, from entening
into any agreernent %vith any publie utility
company incorporated by the Parliarnent of
Canada. If I make a -mis-stateinent o! law,
I hope my honourable friends will correct
me,' for I have flot given thi6 matter the
verv close attention which they have. In
other word6, the province of Ontario has
exercised its legislative powers, as far as it
can do so, to prevent companies incorporated by this Parliament from exercising
their rigchtês, as f.ar as the inunicipalitieG
are concernied. We therefore have in sub-ection 2 of section 3-é4 the provision that
if a Dominion company, incorporated 1w
the ýParliament of Canada, 8hould make
application for consent ta enter the streets
o! a municipality and should not -et that
consent they then have the right to appeal
to the railway board. But consider for a
moment, honourable gentlemen. The Government o! Ontaria bas absolutely prevented
the municipalities of Ontario from gi-ving
their consent to such an application; consequently it is idie ta say that this or any
other company can go before a municipality
in Ontario and ask their consent to put
pales and wires upon the streets. hecause
thev are at once confronited by the prohibition in the statute that the municip4lity
cannot exercise that authority. It is. therefore. folly to talk about giving this company. or anry other company incorporated
hy the Parliament of Canada, an appeal ta
the railway board.
Then "'e corne ta subsection 4, which deals,

to buy out that company, and the fear was
expregsed that the Toronto and Niagara
Company might buy out the Toronto Electrie Light Company and thus deprive the
city of Toronto of what tbey say is a contract right. My idea was that if the Toronto
and Niagara Company, or any other coinpany. bought out the Toronto Electric Light
Company, knowing that -the Toronto Electrie Light Company was under a contract
to uelU to the city of Toronto, ther purchasing
company should stand in relation Vo the
city af Toronto in just the same position as
the Toronto Electrie Light Company stood,
and the fact of no registration having been
made should not be a matter of any importance. That is the view 1 took of the
question, and when this proposai was submitted to me' I said: -"I
will read it in one
minute. Yes, I -will,accept thie, because it
only carnies out whit 1 say à~ now the law
with regard Vo the rights of the city of Toronto." This is the proviso which it is suggested should ýbe added at the end of the
new section 374:
Provided alwrays that whenever any compamy Incorpom'ted by apecial Act ot the Pariament, 0f Canada acquires the assets of -a distribution company operating within the municipality, which imunincipallty bon -the rigbt by

of the said agreemient.
That protects the city of Toronto or any
other city which has the right to buy out a
company. If the company is hought out
before the turne arrives when the miunicipality may buy it out, it wiI be beld ln
trust and subject to the terins of the agreement under which the municipality bas the
right to buy. I arn quite willing to accept
that. Thusthe position of things is simply
that every -municipality, or every company,
whether it is incorporated by gener-al Act
or by special Act, is remitted to the rights
that it had under the legisiation of the Parjiament of Canada and is at liberty t-o bave
these defined and adjusted by the courts of
the courntry, or to appeal from the courts of
this country to the Privy Council if it so

of a number of complicated and very important contracts which are affected by
statutes of this Parliament and of the Parliument of Ontario, which have exercised
the Supreme Court of Ontario and the Privy
Council as well, and as to which they have
not aI-ways agreed. It is not f-air to ourselves to assume the duty of exercising the

study to kinow whethcr or not tlue opinion
is correct, but I amn told that in accordance
with the principles laid down by the Privy
Counceil when the case o! the Toronto and
Niagara Power Company was before it, the
insertion of subsection 5 in the amendment
proposed by the honourable gentleman fromn.
Middleton <Hon. W. B. Ross) would have
the effeet of putting ail corporations which
have been heretofore incorporated by special
Act in as favourable a position as is now
the Toronto and Niagara Power Company,
notwithstan4ing the fact that if the old law
were allowed ta' stand as it is they would
nlot be in that position. That is a resuit
which, I am sure, neither the honourable
member nor this committee desires te brîng
about. It appears to me that this clause is
noV necessary. I arn not venturing rny own
opinion on this, but it would he a most
disastrous resuit if ail companies which
have not now the power to go through the
streets of any city should be given that
power by this section. I draw the attention of the comrnittee to this, because my
attention has been hraught to it by counsel for the city of Toronto, who professes
te be famîliar with the decision o! the
Privy Council and has assured mne that this
section will not only protect, if it is necessary Vo, protect, the Toronto and Niagara
Power Company in its right. but will clothe
miany companies who bave not now such
rights *with the same rights as those of the
Toronto and Niagara Power Company.
Hon. WV. B. ROSS: No, it wvill not.
As I
Hon. 'Mr. LYNCH--STÂUNTO-Ný
say, not baving read the decision of the
Privy Council for sonue timie, I g-ive you
that opinion for your consideration as it
has been given te me. Personal]y I
cannot isee any reason for changing the
statute of 1906 in this regard. It appears ta
be the sense of the committee that there
should be no retroactive legisîstion. If the
proviso wvhich bas just been read were
adopted as a subsection in lieu of subsection 5, I cannot see how the Toronto and
Niagara Power Company would be injured.
But I do see-because it is caid that if
anything is concealed from Providence it
is the final judgment in a lawsuit-that it
would open up a long vista ai litigation for
the variaus municipalities o! Canada. I
think it should he made absolutely clear.
if that--clause is te stand, that no lawsuit
could .be based upon an argument such as

position. 1 do nlot wish, and will nlot vote,
to deprive any corporation of its rights;
but, as I said yesterd-ay, I wtish to guard
against any municipality being deprived of
is; rights. I think it is a grave matter to
enact this isection without making it amply
clear that it wiIl net bring into the ambit,
in which the Toronto and Niagara Power
Company now has, the good fortune to be.
al.other corporations who are net equal-ly
favoured.
Hon. W. B. ROSS:- Subsection 5 is not
miade altogether for the city of Toronto, the
Toronto Electric Light Company and the
Toronto and Niagara Power Company.
They are not the only things in the world
to be considered. Subsection 5 provides,
first, that wvhatever substantive special
rights any comipanies have by special Act
of the Parliarnent of Canada shall not be
taken away fromt theni by section 374; but
it confers absolutely not one scintilla of a
new power on themn. The second part of
the subse'ction provides that if they are
abusing the special powers that we are preserving to theni, the Railway Board may
intervene on the petition of municipalities
and supervise them. There is not in it a
line that confers any new right. It sixnply
esys: "What you have you hold; if you
abuse your privileges, the Railway Commission will take you in band."
BEIQUE: I do not think the
Hon. M.Nr.
honourable gentleman froni Middleton
<Hon. W. B. Ross) is quite, right in saying
that there is nothing new in subsection 5 as
,proposed by him. This matter is covered
by section 3, which says:
E'xce'pt as in this Act otherwlse provided,(a) this Àot shall be oonstrued gas Inorporate
with the special Act; and
(b) 'where the provisions o>f this Act and of
&ny Speciai Act passed by the Parliamnift of
Canada relate to the saine eubiect-inatter the
provisions of the Spectal Act shall, in go far
as la ne-ceasary to give effect to such Special
Act, b. taken to over-ride the pro jalons of this
Act.
Therefore I do not see the necessity o!
the subsection pro.posed by the honourable
gentleman, as it adds nothing to what 1
have read. For my part, I would prefer
that' the ]aw remain as it was. If I may be
permitted ta do se, I would caîl attention
to the new paragraph which'it la proposed
to add at the suggestion of the honourable

sent oi' that niunicipality. That is fundamental law, and if this honourable cornmittee departs irom that, it is departing
froin ûne of our most fundaniental princfple-z of constitutional British riguht, and
liberty. The Iawv lias been 'consistent from
1899 onward-I need nlot go further back
than that-as I can show by reference to
the Railway Acts of 1899, 1903 and 1906, the
last being- the law to-day. Those Acts al
made provision that a municipality ahall
have ini certain cases, especially for distribution purposes, the right of veto on cornpanies coniing in and selling and distri-buting- power, tearing up streets, and s0 on.
The eff eet o! taking out these words, as
the proposed amendnient would do, would
be to pass a general Act saying that - the
company shall not, except, as ini this section
provided, acquire, construet, maintain or
operate sny works," etc., without consent.
This will be in a general Railway Act. But
the decision of the Privy Council in the
case of the Toronto and Niagara Power
Conmpany, wbich we have had before us,
shows that the court would hold that this
being a general Act, and there being apecial
powers con! erred upon the power cornpany
in a special Act, that is, as to going into
s communîty, those special powers would
be inconsistent with the general Act. The
Privy Council has held-and 1 presurne
their decision is our law to-day-that the
provisions of the general Act are set aside,
and the provisions of the special Act govern.. But the very idea and intention in
prefacing the operative part of this subsection 2 with the words, -Notwithstanding anytbing contained i any special or
other Act," etc., was to niake the law uniforrn and of general application to ail power
companies, requiring themi to ohtain the
consent of a comrnunity or municipality
hefore invading it. If those words are allowed to remain in-the words proposed to
be deleted by tbis aniendmentý-the purpose
of the law wîlI be satisfied, and the various
municipalities wiil have the right of saying
who shall enter their streets. That was the
iaw heretofore, undèr an omnibus clause
in a g&eneral Act relating to telephones,
telegrapbs and power companies. This is
the first tirne it has been separated, as I
pointed out to the cominittee la8t night.
This wilI be perceived by looking at clause
373, subsection 2 o! which Tequires the consent o! the inunicipality. That law bas
heretofore applied to power cornpanies, se
that I can fairly say, and I arn safe in
saying, that the law as contained in the
Bill nowv before this House in section 374,

subsection 2, appears to be the same law
that we have since we have been dealing
with power companies.
The proposed
amienduient is a departure froni that.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: That is not in the
Act o! 1906-either section W4 or 248. I
thought mny honourable friend was arguing
that those words were the same as we had
in the Act of 1906.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: He did argue that.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: They are in
section 373. I read the exact language of
bath sections, and, as I understand it,
that is the same section that was tbe general law with reference to telephone. telegraph or power companies. I have nlot
here the volume of statutes o! 1906, but the
words that are propo-sed to be stricken out
o! this section are in substance the same
as the prefacing words of section 2, of the
immediately preceding clause, 373, wbich
has been passed.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOOK: No, we bave not
deait with that yet.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: It was passed
by the Commons, and it has been in the
Bill; but even if it be flot yet adopted,
surely there should be uniformity with regard to the rigbts, powers and obligations
o! the -municipalities and communities on
the one hand and of tbe companies on the
other. That is the desire and design o!
making this a uniform general Act-that ail
shahl ba bound by it; but if those words are
deleted, tben the cornpany is simply at
large, because the special powers contaîned
in the charter would be inconsistant with
the general powers contained in subsection
2 as altered by the honourable gentleman's
ameudmant, for tbe Privy Council says the
special Act shaîl prevail, and we inight go
abead drawing general Acts until we were
black in the face and they vould -be of no
application. What is the use of our passing
general leguisîstion bere, as we tbink, governing and appiying to ail] companies with
uni!orrnity and equality if we are practicaliy legalizing any and every power that
is contained in any charter or Act granted
or passed by the Dominion Parliament or a
provincial legîslature, or given to a conipany incorporated by a departinent of any
province, where those powers corne in conflict witb the generai policy of Canada as
enacted in the general Railway Act. The
decision o! the Privy Council being that

nothing; yet this amendnient wourd legalize
perhaps hundreds of special powers conferred by epecial Acts passed by the Domninion Parliament or by any or ail of the provinces of Canada either under letters patent
from departmente or by Acts of their legislatures. Surely that, ia a step in the dark.

the other part of the clause, but, in connection with subsection 5. as proposed in
the amendment, it makes it emphatic that
anything contained in a special Act, either
of the Dominion or of any province, shall

of a general Act that -we may pasS here.
Therefore I appeal to the conmittee to
support the clause as submitted te us in the

incorporated in the Railway Act. I cannet see the soundness of the proposition.
I do not desire to take up the time of
this hanourable House, but I think that
the arguments of the honourable gentleman
should not go to the public wîthout being
answered. Let me recali in very few words
the legielation on this ver>' important question. Up ta 1899 there had been -ver>' few
companies incorporated with the power to
develop and dietribute electricit>'. In 1899
it wai deemed proper te protect the municipalit>', and an amendment w.as paseed
in 1899, as found in the first paragraph of
section 247 of the iRailway Act as embodied
in the Revised Statute«. which read:

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:
The honourable
member from Toronto (Hon. Mfr. MacdonsU>) is repeating in another form the
argument hie made the other night. He is
raising the same question. What ie proposed ie to adopt the exact provision that
was incorporated in the Railway Act of
1903, and which is te be found in the Revised Statutes of 1906. The rule to which
the honourable gentleman objects is to bie
found in section 3 cf the Railway Act as incorporated in the Revieed Statutes.
This Act shall, subject ta the provisions there-

as often au the coepany thinka praper, ina>
break up and open an>' hlghway, square or
other place, subject, however, te thie fellowing
provisions.

Of. b. ooetrUed; as tncOarsxwted nth the Sapeclal
Act, and. unless otherwlse express>- provided
In this Act, wtiere thie provisions of tbis Act,
snd of an>' Special Act passed by the P.rliament of Canada, relate ta the saine subject
matter, thie provisions of the Special Act shal),
in ao far es ie necessary to give effect to such
Specil Act be taken ta override the provisions
of thls Act.

This is the principle upon îvhich ail our
legisiation has been enacted; and net only
aur legielation, but if the honourable gentleman will refer to Maxwell'a - Interpretation of Statutes," fourth edition, lie '«iii
find on page 367 the ver>' plain rule:
Where a general Act la incorporated into a
apecl one, the provisions of the latter would
prevail over 811> of the farmer with whlch
the>' were Intionsigtent.

That has been the uniforin practice, and
the principle upon which we have alwaye
legislated; and because the honourable gentleman objecte ta a special charter which
was granted by this Parliainent in 190. to
the Toronto and Niagara Power Company,
hie now asks us to reverse that principle.

When any cSmpan' -le empowered b>' Speclal
Aot of thie Parliament of Canada ta canstruct,
operate and ma4ntaln unes of telegraph, or
télephane, or for the conveyance of light. heat,
power or electrlcity, thie campan>' may, with the

square, or other public place, enter thereon for

the purpoee of exerclilng the aaid powers, and,

Then the safeguards that were to be adopted for the protection of the inunicipalit>'

suggestion. what is now subsection 5 cf section 247 cf the present Railway Act, iras

Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: WilI the haonourable gentleman read subsection 8 as well
in connection with that?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Yes, 1 am going
te read it. At the saine time it seema ta
ine that that was for the protection cf the

when it had to cross a number of municipalities.
Hon. «Mr. MACDONELL: That la righit,
too.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Recause the time had
corne when electrie power could be trans.
mitted quite a long distance. But at the
samie time 1 suggested the incorporation of
subsection 8, which is in the Revised
Statutes:
Nothing contained in this section &hall be
dee.msd to autheSie te coensJny to exercise
the Powers Uierein mentioe
fer the purpose
of aelling or~ dist'ib¶>tng lgtt, heat power or
electriclty In clue, tommes or villages, wtout
the coenpany having flrist obtained consent
theretor by a by-law of the municipalty.

So there were two things: the electrie
company was protected, so far as long distances were concerned, for the transmission of power. and coultl obtain either the
consent of the municipality or the consent
of the railway board; but, as regards thbe
distribution and, sale of power in municipalities, as it might be done in competition
with a municipality owning an electrical
plant, it was deemed proper further ta protect the mni'cipality by exacting in that
case, and in ail cases, the consent of the
municipality. That was the law which was
adopted in 1903, and it bas remsined the
law to this day. I think it was a wise provision ta ad.opt.
Hon. M-\r. MACDONELL: Will the bonourable gentleman, as the father of subsection 8, let me ask him one question regardJng that subsection, which is extremely
beneficial and proper ta be in a special Act?
By the decision of the Privy Council under
this very subsection, where a power company has certain powers which are inconsistent with the powers of the general Act,
the benefit of the section bas been nullifled; and I -would ask the bonourable gentleman whether it is not 'wise and proper ta
re-enact section 8 in such a way that it
will fnlfll the purpose for which it was
passed, narnely, to be a live law and to be
respected.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I want to keep my
argument consecutive. I 'will corne to the
point which the bonourable gentleman mentions in a moment. But let me say this,
that such was the law gaverning ail companies, and. sncb is the law ito-day. The
bonourable gentlemfan
complains - and
copies of a memorandum have been distributed in this House in which it is attempted
to show that we are going to do an injustice
ta rnunicipalities. Thiat is the position
Hon. -%r. B3EIQUE.

whicl the honourable gentleman took, the
other day and 15 110w trying to support.
Let us consider for a few minutes the
question whether it is true or flot that we
are serving a special intereat in violation of
municipal rights. Previous ta 1902 a number of companies had been incorporated. for
the purpose of distributing electricity. I
may refer to a few o! tbem. There was tbe
Hamilton and Lake Erie Power Company,
whicb. was incorporated in 1895, by chapter
'48. It will be found in the charter of tbat
company that the company wae obliged to
obtain the consent of the municipality before it could distribute power in Hamilton
or in any otber municipality. In 1897 the
Continental Light and Power Company was
incorporated by this Parliament, by chapter 72. It was likewise made subj.ect to the
obligation of obtaining the consent of the
municipality. Then, in 1901, the Ottawa
and Hull Power Company, o! which the
honourable member from Rideau (Hon.
Mr. Edwards) was a promoter, was incorporated. It obtained only the enabling
power; so it had to obtain the consent of
the municipality. In 1901, again. the St.
Lawrence Power Company was incorporated
by Chapter 111, and it also was obliged ta
obtain the consent of the municipality. In
the following year the Toronto and Niagara
Power Company was incorporated; but
under what circumstances? It was incorporated, not for the purpose of developing.a smnall amount of electrîcity and transmitting it into one city, but witb a view ta
developing the Niagara hydro-electric power
ta a very large extent, and tranemitting it
a distance of 100 or 125 miles to the cities
o! Hamilton and Toranto and to other
municipalities. It was -an enterprise whichi
could not be carried out except by the
expenditure of perhaps $15,000,000, $20,000,000 or $30,000,000. It demanded an enormous expenditure, and the company was
declared to be a company for the general
advantage of Canada. What was the condition? It asked this Parliament that, as
it had to traverse a large number of
municipalities, it should not be Eubject ta
the obligation of obtaining the consent o!
the municipalities. It would flot have been
practicable ta obtain it. And the honourable gentleman seems to be surprised that
this power wa granted.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: No, not the
power to transmit. It is proper that it
should be granted; but 1 refer to the
power o! distribution.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The power a! distribution is ta be !ound in the -same clausýe;

APRIL 17, 1918
and the honourable gentleman says. "But
it vas a surprise sprung on Parliament.*"
The honourable gentleman read the other
day fraxu the memarandum which vas distributed here and froxu Hansard; but the
hanourable gentleman did not read ail. If
he had read Hansard praperly, he would
have faund that the members representing
the city of Hamilton quite understood that

ourable gentleman to imply either that I
misread or improýperly read Hansard. I
made a short reference Woit, and used certain language which I had copied from it,
Gtating that the full report was to be found
in Hansard but that 1[ would not take up
the time of the flouse in reading it. What
I said faithtully represents what is Wo be
found there. I1f the honourable gentleman
imputes to me an improper or an incorrect reading of Hansard, I asik hlm to withdraw the imputation.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I saîd the honourable gentlemen did flot understand. I do
flot question the good faîth of the honourable gentleman. .I said hie did flot read
sufficient of Hansard Wo
understand the full
beaxing of the question at issue.
Hon,. Mr. MAC7DONELL: I have read
the whole of Hansard.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I have too much
respect for my codleagues *to follow the
example of the honourable gentleman. The
other day, ini the course of the discussion,
-the honourable gentleman passed a judgment and made peroonal remarks which
were very offensive as far as I was concerned. I have no desire to repay him in
the same coin; but I think I am justified in
sayilg, as I think I have shown, that the
honourable gentleman did flot understand
the purport of the discussion as it took
place before the Railway Committee. Of
course, 1 might have done the sanie thing
if I had flot read the whole of the discussion.
The honourable gentleman seems to attach a great deal of importance to the decision of the Prîvy Councîl. WVeil, for my
part, I do not attach mueh importance to
that decision, for the reason that I have
stated. Froin the nature of the charter
and from. the nature and importance of the
works which. were te be carried out, I think
it is iquite plain that the comrpany could
not be subjec-ted. toý the necessity of obtaining the consent of the municipalities. I
amn satis-fied that the powers they received
were gran.ted. with the knowledge and consent of the city of Hamilton and the city
of Toronto. Now, I will ask the honourable
gentleman a question: would it be reasonaible to suppoce that any capit-aliést would
spend ten, fifteen or twenty ill1ions in an
enterprise without having a charter?
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: If the honourafile gentleman wvill permit -me, I will
answer now.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Permit me to finish.
Is it reasonable to suppose that lie would
Hon. Mr-.

INACT)ONELL.

do that without taking the precaution either
of obtaining the power to do se 4by virtue
ef an .Act of 1>arliament or obtaining the
consent of the municipalitiee?
Now, I -have ehown, that the company hiad
obtained the necessary consent by virtue
of their charter. If tha-t con-senft had not
been granted by their charter, it goes witheut saying that they would have aipplied
te the different cities% and very likely they
would have obtained the consent of the city
ef Toronto before spending their money.
The city of Toronto rexnained quiet. They
neyer said a word unitil 1911, when. ten or
fltteen million dollare had heen spent and
the power had been developed at Niagara

Hon. Mr. MAJODONELL: No, no; by thi6
Company.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Weil, not by this
oompany. The honourable gentleman read
froin a memorandum, and I take it.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: Oh, ne.

governed by section 90 o« thOe Raiiway Act
amended as above set out. This la cieariy
shown by thse report (rom Haneard.

0f course, that is not according to fact.
Later on, it ray6:
fly an agreemnent dated thse 29th January,
1903. William Mackenzie, Henry Mill Peflatt
and Frederlck Nidiolis obtained fx-om the Coinmissioners of the Queen Victoria Niagara Falls
Park thse right to develop from thse waters of
thse Niagara river a large quantlty of electricai
horse-~power under the terms and onditions
of that agreemnent, and on thse 21et of Marcs,
1903, the' saie three parties assigned tis
agreemnent to tise Eleotrical Developinent Cornpany, Limited, a coenpany Inorpom-ted by
Letters Patent under the Ontario Companies
Act. The agreement and assigninent were approved and con'firmed by an Act of thse legislature oft thse province oft Ontario In thse year
1905, numbered chapter 12, and thereatter thse
Electricai Developinent Comnpany moade and
constructed lis developinent works at Niagara
Fails and thse Toronto axai Niagara Power

1APRIL 17, 1918
and expended by the latter conipa'y In lUs
undertaking and received therefor all the teBued bonde and the capital stock of the Toronto
and Niagara Power Comnpany which it now

controls.
Here is the admission, in a statementfcund in the memorandum. te which. the
honourauble gentleman drew our attenton,
liat the. large amount of money which was
expended te develop thal power and to transmit it was furnished upon lie guarantee of
the stock and bonde cf thç Toronto and
Niagara Power Coempany.
Hon. Mr. MAODONELL: le the. honourable gentleman aware-I assume that he is
-cof what teck place in this oommittee last
session on the very aubject that lhe honourabl. gentleman is now la.bouring? The
solicitor for, I t.hink, tie Empire Trust Company, a very credible man of Toronto, was
bere, and hie eaid tuat the total bond issue
cf the company was a million end a half,
and the total capital stock issue $856,000, or
$869.000, or thereabouts, a total cf a little
ever $2,300,000. The. honeurable gentleman
has changed liai new into eight or ten million.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I amn aware that there
were a number of incorrect statementa made.
Hon. Mr. MAODONELL: By the. promatera.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: 1 find incorrect stalemente and correct uluLements in this meseranduin, "d 1 draw attention te lhe
fact that lie amount necesary for the development cf that power and fer its transmission for a distance of 125 miles or more
was furnisbed on the. guarantee o! the stock
and bonda cf the Toronto and Niagara Power
Comnpany. I suppose the honourable gentleman will not dispute that statement.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL:- Those are net
the. facta.
*Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The statement is according te lhe facts. At my request lest
ssession the contracta and other documenta
wene depoeited on the Table cf this Chaniber.
These people, cf course, would net expend
the money without having power te proceed.
Now t.bal they have made their enterprise
good-whetber tbey expended five, or ten,
or fifteen millions cf dollars-now thal conditions are changed and the. city of Toronto
and the Hyd.ro-Electric Commission -are deaireus cf getting rid of that company, we
are asked te repeal the powers given te them,
and te prevenl them in thbe future f res dislributing power in the cities cf Toronto sud
Hamilton. Would it net be prepostereus,
honeurable gentlemen? I undersland that

1.3

the company have sold some 30,000 horsepower te the Toronto Electrie Light Conmpany. and t.hat their contract wilI corne to
an end in a couple of years because the city
bas the power to purchase the assets of that
company. What would b. the position of
the Toronto and Niagara Power Company
il we were te do 'what ham been suggeeted
by the henourable gentleman? They would
have 30,000 horse-power to seil, and they
could net put up an additional pole or an
additional wire in the city,.of Toronto for
the. purpose cf distributing that power.
This is what we are asked te do by the
honeurable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Macdenell) uupported by the united municipalities.
1 cannet believe that the urxited municipalities understoed what they were asking
us te de. I have ne interest whatever in
company. I arn anxious, as I have
ti
always been, te proteet the rights ef the
municipalities; but in thia instance, as in
any other instance, 1 think Parliament
should keep f aith accerding te the
charters that have been granted, because
te act otherwise, as wae very well stated
by the. leader of the. Gcvernment in thia
Heuse, would be abselutely destructive te
the credit of this ceuntry.
Subsections 1, 2 and 3 of the amendnient
were agreed te.

The amendment ef Hen.-Mr. Béique te

was agreed te.
On subsection 5 of the amendmentapplication te existing companies:
Heu. Mr. MAODONELL: I did not understand that subsection 5 of the Bill had been
stricken eut, but the whole discussion is
open now because ef the amendment. Now,
this la a moat important clause-in fact. the
governing clause of the whole section. The
effeet cf tihat clause is very far-reaching,
because it undces ail th. legisiation that
we have heretofore passed regarding the

SENATE
consent which is required ta be obtained
by thé companies before they enter municipalities to tear up streets, and so an. The
efiect ai thls clause would be very much
wider and very much more far-reaching
than its cornparatively -innocent surface
would indicate, or as was the design ar purpose, as I apprehend, of the pranioter or
prornoters o! tliia propased arnendment; because it not oniy makea provision ,for the
cantinuance in perpetuity o! the powers c!
the Taranto and Niagara Power Company
ta invade municipahities with or without
leave or license, but like a11 efforts that
are usually over-strenueus, they overreach
thernielves anud go even further than the
perpetrators intended. The effect of this
clause ia aimply thie, that it reinoves from
the contrai o! -the inunicipalities nat only
the company we have in mnd here-the
Toronto and Niagara Power Company-but
ail other companies, incorporated by or under an Act o! the Farliament of Canada
or o! any province, -which have special
powera in their Acts a! Incorporation, which
speciai powers may corne int confliet with
the genereal Act; because once they corme
into conflict or are inconsistent with the
provisions af a general Act, t.he latter provisions fail. This propoaed amendment has
been carefully prepared, and la in the very
language o! the decision o! the Prîvy Council in the Toronto and Niagara Power Ccpany case; the design and purpose evidently being ta effect e change in the law with
regard, flot only to the Tarante and Niagara
Power Company, but ail companies whose
speciai powers muy not be in line with the
provisions a! aur general Railway Act. The
words ai the Privy Council's decisian have
been followed, s0 that the amendment, if
it becomea part ai the StatuIez ai Canada,
will dovetaîl Most beauti!ully wjth the
wvorda ai the Privy Council in the Toronto
and Niagara Power Company case. and impose on the people af Canada ad infinitum
ail power companies whoae special objeta
or powers are in conflic't with the provisions
of the general Railway Act. The head-note
ta that case in the Privy Council becomes
imnportant, as iA gives the language which
has been copied in the amendment naw before the House; and therefore I wish te
quote it as given in the House ai Lords
Appeal Cases, 1912, page 834:

is

That is, the general Act was of no effect
as against the Power Company, who were
the appellants. Not only ia the language
of this proposed amendmnent sufficient to
cover, as 1 say, any other power company
whose objects or powers may corne in conflit with the general Act, but it was the
manifest intention of the drafteman that
it should be so; and because of the language
the honourabl«è gentleman used who introduced it-which will be found on page 164
of the Debates of the ïSenate of Tueaday,
April l6th. instant. At that time the honourabie gentleman who introduced the
arnendment (Hon. W.; B. Rosa), atter read.
ing the subsection in question, interpolated
these words:

Power Oornpany, but tIt1s provison saves ail

companies.
Hon. W. B. BOSS: No argument &bout
that.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: " Baves ail
companies;" but what becomes o! the municipalitiesP Savlng the companies at the expense af the peopie-that is what At was;
and at the present time no ompany, go
far as I amn aware, is seeking the rights
which the Toronto and Niagara Power Comrpany la seecking, namely, to invade the
domain of any xnunicipality without its
consent. But when this clause passes, every
power company, whether incorporated by
the Dominion of Canada or by any province,
or under any method by which a carnpany
can be incorporated in a province, if its
powers or objects as stated in its docuiment
of incorporation-are inconsistent with the
provisions of the general Raiiway Actand il is in the general Railway Act that
the general power companies' clauses are
contained- every such power company will
have special privileges, which .may have
been given .by a province down by the ses,
or in the West, or in Ontario or any other
province, and 'which shall prevail over the
powers given by the general Act. Thua we
are saying to these companies, "«Corne one,
corne ail," withont knowing anytbing about
their powers. We are aaying that wherever
there i8 a cornpany that has a charter
whose special privileges are in confiict with
the general Railway Act the latter ahail not
prevail; and in that case, if it were needed,
though iA is not by this amendiment, the
Privy Council cornes ta the aid o! this miscellaneou'i aggUregation of companies that

APRIL 17, 1918
are or may be arrayed againat the municipalities, and says that where that condition
arises and exista. and where the special
privileges confiet with the general Railway
Act, the special Act shall prevail, and our
general legisiation goes for naught in se -far
as thoae companies are concerned. That is
the legical and necessary censequence and
resuit of this section the moment it becomes law.
Whbat is more, it is en entrely new departure -from the law of Canada. Permit
nie to make a short referenoe te the staitutes
which govern thus matter. The general Railway Act protete -the Tights cf municipalities segmet cosnies incorporatcd by
épeciai Act or other authority of -the
Dominion, except the Toroute end Niagara
Power Comnpainy. This company, the Privy
Council 'held. w.. not se restricted, althoughji t was plainly the intention of
Parliament te brdng tbhat coenpany within
the provisions cf the general law, as shown
by Hausard of 1902, pages 3629-3033-34with whidh the honourable gentleman from
De Bailberry (Hon. Mr,. Béique) vas good
enough to enlighten the Bouse to-night.
The resuIt of enactimg aubsection 5 cf 'the
Rom amendment -wotrld be te confer upon
aN Dominion snd provincial companies
which have specifie powera te enter upon
the etreetas of îmuaiipaf1itie. tihe rig4ht te
exercise these powers withoezt the consent
cf the municipality, and therefore, instead
cf confinuing the protection municipalities
have ihitherto enjoyed, it would deprive
themi of sny protection whatsoever, as re-_
garde the class of cenipanies referred te
in subseetion 5.
I furthermore contend-although -this is
a legal question on which. my opinion might
net ultimnately prevail-that àf a cempany

by Parliament upon the Toronto and
Niagara Power Company, [but it aie extends to and clothes other companies with
those powers, and tenders inoperative the
municipal protective sections of tahe Railway Act wihich bave been included in sucli
charters since 1899. The isubsection as proposed iby the honourable aenator (Hon. W.
B. Ross) egga.vates and multiplies the

Just a word as to the general lawheretofore existing on tb.ia subWet, beoause this
is entirely a new departure. I have no
way cf predicting what niay bef ail the
legisiation elsewhere, if passed here; but.
I cannot imagine a free deliberative body
passing thus legisiation and hoping or expecting that the people cf any country
or its legiuiatures would maintain or preserve it. It is impossible te imagine, because, as 1 will briefly point ent, frooe 1899
down to the present moment ne company
lias had the right to go inte a municipality
and distribute or seil power without the
consent cf the municipality. .My honourable friend from De Salalberry (Hon. Mr.
Béique) akiifully mavoided the discussion of
the différence between transmission and
distribution. Although he is the father ot
subsection, 8 cf ectiin 247 of the 'Railway
Act of 1906, hie is seeing bhis child, in the
form of section 8, practically m.assacrcd
here to-night, yet makes no attempt te save
the life ot what he himself hias produced.
Now, the protection ot the control of the
streets et municipalities against the exercise of the powers cf power companies bas
been given by the general Railway Aot
since the year 1899. In tbat year section
90 cf tihe general Railway Act was amended
se as te restrict the exercise of ithe
riglits of power companies, by providing
that such riglits should only be exercised
with the -consent of the municipality. My
honourible friend iroim De Salaberry knows
well the contents of section 90, and sought
te have two subsectione et that section inserted in this very Toronto and Niagara
Power Company Bill when it went through
the Bouse. Bcw did the honourable gentleman discharge bis duty te the public

ing in the province of Ontario, and is not
operating in the province 1 represent, and
therefore I have ne further concern in
the matter." And so he let it pa.se. Is that
discharging d-uties in accordance with what
is in'posed upon h-onourable gentllemen
who are here to carry on legisiation in the
interesits of ail the people of this great
co'untry? I hardly think so.
The general RLailway Amendment Act
of 1899, chapter 37, section 1, subeection 2,
reads as follows:
2. When any comps4y has power by any

Act of ;the Parisinent of Camadan to construct

and mnaintain lunes oft elegrapSi or tmephone, or
Unes Mor the conweyance of light, heat, power or
electricity, sudi cornpany may, with the consent of the miunicipal councdI or other authority
having Juriadiotion over any highway, square
or other publtc placoe, enter thereon for thie
purpose ci exerclaing the. mid power, and, as
otten as thie cornpany' tiiinks proper, rnay break
up and opien uny higlhway, square, or other
public pflace, subjeet, however, to thie followIng
provisions:
Then certain provisions are made as te

shade trees, etc. 1 arn takmng every Railway Act since 1899. This provision continued mn force until t.he paasage of the
general Rai1lway Act of 1903, wben it was
re-enacted in a more positive form by section 195, st*bsection zf, w.hidh reads as
follows:
Nothing onta.ined in this section shahl be
deemed te authorize thie company exerclsing
thie Powers therein mentioned for -the purvoSe
of sellMng or distribuilng ligit heat, power or
eleotricity hi cities, towns or villages, without
thie comnpany havlng first ebtained the. oongent
tiierefor by a by-la;w ef the municipality.
That is, as I understand, in direct line with
t.he view of the honeurable member from
De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique) on the

question of distribution, aud it affects ouly
t.he distribution.
IMuch has been said here about the transmission of power. We ail agree on t.he right
of the company to transmit its power, and
if the municipality blocks the way in a dogin-the-manger fashien the R-ailway Commissien has t.he right, a is proper, to lif t the
gate, to rais. the embargo, te let the line
through. AI I have said in my arguments
is dîrected te the question of distribution.
I say that no company should be able, withont leave or license, to enter a municipality
as a veudlor of power -and chop down trees,
dig, up streeta, etc.
LIn the la.st Act on the subject-in subsection 8 of section 247, chapter 37, cf the
Revised Statutes of 1906, this provision ws
re-enacted witheut change, and it has remained in force Vo the present time. It has
been in effect for 19 or 20 years. The general

Railway Act restricted the exercise of the
right ef power companies te operate in the
streets of cities, towns and villages, by requiring the company te obtain the consent
of the municipalities. Now it is proposed Vo
take downi this atone wall of protection for
the people which has stoed for the lest 19
or 20 yeara. I 'would. ask honourable gentlemen Vo consider and weigh very carefully
this proposed amenchnent, be-cause if it is
passed a wrong will be done that must be
remedied soon or late. Believe me--if I
may be permitted Vo use that term-the consequence will be that not only will t.his particular company, which is a free lance, be
allowed te run at large without let or hindrance, but the door will aise b. open ta
every other company, incorporated by the
Dominion Parliament or by provincial
authority, te acquire powers which are inconsistent with the provisions of the general
Railway Act. &e, if this amendiment is
passedý we do two things: we take down
the wall which preteets communities
througheut the length and breadth of Canada, and in addition w. enable other cornpanies t-e obtain powers and privileges
which may be in coufiet with the general
Railway Act. We might just as well stop
passing general Railway Acte, or any other
general legialiation, because if sucb -a practice is permitted with regard to pewer cernpanies and railway companieg, we cannot
expect te apply a different mile te banks,
trust companies and other financial institutions.

posite, when the matter cornes up I shall
be prepared ta say what the intention ci
the Government je. It ie quite evident
from the resolution itseli that this Houe
je asked to express its opinion upon th"
expediency of the regulations which arc
set. forth in the motion. If the House
chooses to refrain from giving expression
to its approva], it then becomes a question
for the Government ta decide what it
shauld do.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Suppose the resolution were not sanctioned by Parliament,
the Order in Council 'would- preivail.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If the
same thing happened in the House of Commons, I fancy the Governient would regard it as a want of confidence in tihe Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I draw the attention of the honourable gentleman ta
anoth *erpoint which he may take up with
his colleagues. This resolution cornes simultaneouely before this House and before
the other House. It is -possible that amendmente may be auggested 'which inay appear
to the majority in the other Houe ta- be
advisable. le it well for this Chamber ta
take up this reaolution before knowing what
the Cominons have decid'ed' This Ch.amber
may modify it, and the Coinmons may at
the same time do so, with the resit that
we may be exchangaing two documents
which. may vary. This Parliament is bere
for the purpose o! throwing light on Bills
or resolutions if it can de so. Would it not
be better procedure £or this Chamber ta
wait until the Commons have acted on the
resolution which is presented ta them?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: To-niorrow I shall be better prepared ta answer
that question.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I feel very strongly
with the honourable gentleman from De
Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand). There is
a regular -way of dealing with a joint resolution. The resolution je .paesed in one House,
and if it is agareed ta in that House it is
sent to. the other House for concurrence.
In this case the Governrnent apparently
proposes ta have two independent resolutione passed by the two Hanses at the came
time. My contention ie that that ie a very
unparliamentary way to proceed.
The notice of motion stands.

RAILWAY ACd

'CONSOLIDATION BILL.

FURTHER CONSIDERÂTION IN COMMITTEE.

The Senate again went into committee on
Bill A, en Act. to consolidate and amend the
Rail'way Act.-Hon. Sir James Lougheed.
Iion. Mr. Girroir in the Chair.
On paragraph e of section 3-provisions
incorporated with special Act:
Hon. Mr. BEI QUE: When this section
was befre us previouély I suggested that
paragraph c, which. is a new paragraph,
should b. etruck out. I drew attention to
the fact that if. is hardly in harmony with
paragraph b. Another reason for striking
if. out je that under paragraph c companies
who have taken the precaution of incorporating in their charter any section of the
Raiiway Act by adopting the words o! the
section would have the benefit o! the section
thue incorporated,, whereas, if they proceeded in the more expeditious way of
merely saying that such and such a section
o! the Rail'way Act &hallapply ta thie company they *ould not have the came -benefit.
The eection would not have the came effect;
if. would 'be supereeded by any amendment
which might be made in the general Act.
In addition, I do not thirnk if. would be in
accordance with the rules as ta the interpretation o! the statutes.
Hon. Sur JAMES LOUGHEED: With al
due deference to the construction, which
my honourable friend bas placed upon this
section, I believe if. should flot be subject
t4> any canon of construction. This section
states a specifie fact, namely, that the provisions of this Bill will supersede the provisions o! any former g-eneral Act that may
have been im.ported into a special Act. It
seems, "ta me that for the purpase o! uniformity this je very desirable; otherwise we
ahaîl 'have running through ail special Acte
which .have been passed since Confederation
down ta the present time the clauses o! the
particular general Act which was. in force
at the time the special Act was pa$sed. Is
that, a desirable condition ai things?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I draw the attention o! the honourable gentleman ta the
words " by reference.- The section sys:
Provisions Incorporated with any speciai Act
fram any generai railway Act by reference shalh
be taken, ta be superseded by the provisions of
this Act relatlng ta the same subjeet-matter.

It ie by reference only; so that- if it is
incorporated otherwise-îf a clause or sec-

SENATE

VS2

tion is copied froni the geiîeral Act--then
it is no moie by reference.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHIED: We are
on4y dealing %vith sections or clauses that
have been imported into a special Act by
reference. Let us assume that an Act of
ten years ago provided that sections 1 and
2 vf the general Act should lie incorporated
intto this special Act; surely it is not desirable that we should continue the general
sections of the Act of 1906-if that is the
Act which wa8 in force-when that Act
has been repealed and superseded.
Hon. lMr. -DA.NDURAND: If the draftsman incorporated certain clauses into the
Act, the powers granted under those clauses
would lie retained; whîle, if he simply incorporated them by reference, they wiould
bc subject to any kind of alteration or
modification.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGELEED: That, of
course, would limit the operation of this
clause, and my honourable friend is not
complaining about the limitation.
-Hon. ïMr. DANDURAND: No, but the
h'>nourable gentleman from De, Salaberry
<Hon. 04r. Béique) is justly pointing out
the difference in the treatment accorded to
persons who have special charters with
special plowers. Those who have had those
powers set out at length in their charters
will retain them without variation, while
tiiose who have them by reference will lie
subject to any changes which this Parliament may make.
Hon. Mr. POWE'R: There is another
point to which I think the attention of
the honourable leader of the House might
lie directed. This is really ex post facto
legislation the thing which the honourable
gentleman frorn Hamilton <Hon. Mr.
Lynch-Staunton) s0 thoroughly dislikes.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is only
to bring into line the general clauses of
the general Railway Act.
Hon. 'Mr. POWER: Suppose a special
Act incorporating a railway company was
passed in 1906, and that special Act provided that certain sections of the Railway
Notwithstanding that
Act should apply.
Parliament declared in 1906 that those sections should apply, it is now decided that
they shahl not. It is ex post facto legisIxtion, to my mind.
Hon. M7r. BELCOURT: The resuit of my
honourable friend's (Hon. Mr. B4ique's)
amendment, it seems to mue, would lie that
railways would escape the performance of
obligations which are iTnposed on railways
Hon. Mfr. DANDURAN'D.

.

generally, and iniposed specially on certain
railway oompanies by their Acts of incorporation. Previous Acts hiaving in the
meantime been repealed, those railwav coinpanies would escape liabilities to which
railiways-geneially would otherwvise be subjeet. If that would lie the effeet, of niy honourable friend's amnendment, I cannot support it.
Hon. M-Nr.BEIQUE: What amendment?
Hon. Mr. BELICOURT: If subsection c
is etricken out.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: A similar provisin
wvas flot in the old Act.
For instance.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
take the Canadian Northern railway. The
Canadian No(rthern in one of its specital
Acts had a clause which subjected it to
certain provisions of the then Railway Act.
If you take out subsection c, the general
Railway Adt from which were taken the
cla.uses in 'question having disappeared in
the meantime, the Canadian Northern would
escape the liabilities and obligations imposed upon it.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: No, no. If the hononrable iuember will refer Wothe Interpretation Act he will see that it covers that
case exactly-that the repeal of a section
which was incorporated by reference to a
special Act dMes not at ail affect the special
Act.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: But, as I understand
the honourable member from Ottawa <Hon.
Mr. Belcourt), he says that notwithstandingc
the repeal of the general clauses of the
Railway Act, Mackenzie and Mann would
continue to have those clauses in their Act,
unaffected, by the repeal.
Hon. '-%r. BEIQL'E: Yes. If the Canadian Northern, instead of încorporatîng
those sections nierely byv reference, had
taken the precaution to have thein incorporated wvord for wordHon. Mr. DANDURAND: At length.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Then subsection c
would not apply. Why make a difference
between the two?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Strike
out ««by reference."
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Would it satisfy .the
honourable gentleman if we struc1k out "by
reference," so that the clause would read:
(c) Prévisions incorporated with any special
Act from any general Railway Act shahl be
takeri to be superseded by the provisions of this
Act relating to the sanie subject matter.

18, 1918

-APRIL

Subsection b makes ample provision for
the special clauses. You caui very well have
an Act constructed in this way: As I
pointed out, I think, when this matter wvas
Up before, it may cons'ist of eleven clauses.
Ten may be clauses of a special nature, incorporating the company, and then there
iay be one clause at the end saying that
«'the following section," copied frin the
general Railway Act, " shall apply ta this
oampany;" or, instead of that section, a
section saying that «"sections 300, 301, 304
%and 305 shahl apply ta this company."'
While I coxitend that special clauses in
thaît company's charter should flot be
touched, still, if we add ta the special Act,
tao apply with it, a part of the general Railway Act, it is no invasion of the oompany's
specisi crights, but for the gaod government
of the country, that the general clauses
should apply ta campanies with special
charters.as well as te «Il other cocipanies
in the country. Sa far as I can see, paragraph c does not interfere with the righits
of any oompany at ail. My honourable
friend seeme ta think that companies who
inoarporated clauses by number would *be
suibject to baving themf struck out, while
other companies who had the general
clauses capied verbatini could not. Il there
is a passibility af that, we cauld, by takingout the words "by reference," put theni ail
on -the saine footing. la thbat satisfacitory?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: -I would draw the
attention of the honourable gentleman ta
the f act that paragraph c would then be
exactly the contrary a! paragraph b. Paragraph b would say one thing and paragxaph
c wauld say exactly the opposite. We have
always had the rule as embodied in paragraph b of section 3. It is in the Railway
Act now in force. We have adopted the
saine rule 'that has been adopted in England. Paragraph c was iutended merely ta
eaover«the difference between. incorporation
word for word and incorporation by mare

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Wîll ay
honoura-ble friend pardon me if I point out
ta bîmi that under paragraph b, tbe provisions cd the general Act would have te
ha incona.istent with those of the special
Act, whereas such is not the case in paragraph c.
Han. Mr. LYNÇH-STAUNT0N: We notice
that this section bas been amended. A
change ïa gmade from the old pra.ctic%,
adopted in the Revised Statutea, and. no
doubt the draitsman made this change for
sanie reason-perbaps because of changes

183

in this new Act. I think that in discussing
this without knowing bis reasons we are
going in the dark.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I fully agree
with my honourabie friand. It devolves
upon oe who wants ta maïke a change to
give bis reasans for the change and this
paragraph c is a modification of the old
Act.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: If when'the Bill goes
ta the Hanse of Gommons any good reasan
can be given why the subsection should be
reinstated, it can be reinstated. The mnatter is inerely. I believe, a question of good
legislation.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I amn
quite willing that the words " by reference"~ shall be stricken ont, sa that if the.
court can datermine that a certain sction
of a special Act is a generai section, then
that general section -muet be superseded by
-the analogous section in this Bill-that
which deals with thse sanie subject-matter.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:- Those words - by
re! erence," do not add to or take away
anything froin the subsection.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: As xny
honourabie friend has point-ed out, a general
section may be imported into a speciai Act
word for word, withaut any reference being
made ta its origin. It .may appear ta thse
casuai ieader ta ha a special section as
much as any of the.other sections of the
Act. Now, if it i. found ta have been taken
froni a genaral Act and incorparated inta a
speciai Act, tisera is no reason why it
should not be superseded by the like section in this Bill.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I tbink tise honourable gentleman froin De Saiaberry (Hon.
Mr. Béique> is perfcctly right wben hie asays
that if you strike out tise words " by reference.- then paragraph c is a direct contradiction of paragraph b.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, fia.
Hon. Mr. POWER: There is no question
about it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHF£ED: No, fia.

Hon. Mr. POWER: Paragraps b says:

Hon. Mr. POWER (reading) :
-to give effect to such speciai Act, be taken to
over-ride the provisions of this Act.

Then the paragraph would read:

Mr. Price, the present Railway CommisSioner of Ontario, who drafted the Bill, as
ta the object of thie provision. It ie headed,
"construing with special Act ":

Provisions incorporated with any Special Act
tram any general railway Act shall be taken ta
be superseded by the provisions of this Act
relating ta the saine subject-matter.

Endeavour has been made ta put the section
lnto better tarin-

It is directly contradictory to what has
gone beforeHon. W. B. ROSS: No.
Hon. Mr. POWER: And I agree with the
suggestion made by the honourable gentleman fromn Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStaun4on) that we should find out an what
ground this change was made before, we
proceed.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Paragraph b safeguards and makes prevail as against the
general Railway Act any clause of the
special Act that i8 necessary to give eflect
ta the special Act. The general Act goes
by the bhoard. In paragraph c a provision
that je ne-cessary ta give effect to such
special Act je noct affected at ail. Let me
put a case ta the bonourable gentleman.
Suppose you have a general Railway Act
which limite-the time lor bringing action,
say ta six months. That provision je incorporated inito a epecial Act from the general Act. Suppose -the provision in the general Act je changed from Six monanths ta
three months. T.hat je a part of the gen-eral
legisiation of the country with regard to
the limitation of actions. Such an arnendment as that in the general Adt would,
under paragraph c, go'vern as against the
epecial Act and would not be an invasion
of any substantive rights gîven to a codmpany by its special charter, because such a
general clause as that would not be necessary to give effeet ta the special Act.
Rion. Mr. DANDURAND: But could it
not just as well he governed by paragraph b?
ýHon. W. B. ROSS: No. There ie a distinction -bet-ween paragraph b -and pazagraph c, *which. I have tried te point out.
At- the end of b are the words: "tio give
effect ta such zpecial Act.." That saves
every clause in the special Act that is
necessary to work out the special Act. All
the substantive Tights of the company are
saved. Apart from that, the proviso in paragraph c is that the general lawv of the country shaîl govern.

The section has been recast and paragraph (q)
is new.

That ie, than the aid Act-

To overcome the difficulty which has been
pomnted out, that is, with regard to the
distinction between the use cd the worde
af the general Act and incorpor'ation by
reference, 1 would euggest that the words
'%y reference" shoruld be etricken out; a.nd
if, when this clause cornes before the House
oi Gommons, it is found desirable ta reinsert itheen, we can discues the question
again. 1 Rnove, Mr. Chairman, that. the
words " by reference " be stiiken out.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 0f course, the
principle of the retroactivity of the Act remains intact, and we are passing this clause,
which je a very wvide one, though we do
rnot know te what extent it will affect
special charters.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEE.D: This proposition of law could vexy well be urged,
that the law is always speaking; and if a
general Act bas been ainended, the question
ie whether -the amended general Adt is ta
prevail as against any previauis general Act
whichi bas been repealed and vwhich it bas
superseded.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I dislike ta insiet,
but I arn satisfied that, if the honourable
leader of the Government would consider
the matter mare .fully, hie would see that
there is very serions, objection te the suggestion which he has just made. I would
caîl attentionHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Týo Save
time, I will consent ta striking out paragraph c. If it ie found, before we get

APRIL 18, 1918
through with the Act, that it is really of
value, I shall ask for reconsideration of
this section.
The ameudment of Hon. Mr. Béique, ta
strike out pa.ragraph c, was agreed ta.
Hon. Mir. BELCOURT: Before the sectien is adopted, 1 should ike ta say sornething about paragraph b. 1 do not know
that it i8 very pertinent. 1 rise merely for
the purpose of relieving my conscience, because I feel very strongly about the matter.
The -uards. -"in se far as is necessary ta
give effect to such special Act," ta me are
s0 vague and se> indefinite that I really do not
know wbat they mean. It seeme ta me that
we ought ta hoa ble ta put there samething which vould more clearly express the
idea intended. Those words open up a
whole fild of inquiry, discussion, and controveray as to what would be necessary ta
give effeet ta any special Act. There may
he dozens ai provisions in a special Act
which would conflict 'with the general Railway Act and which may or may not be
neceasary ta give effeot ta the apecial Act.
To my mind the wording is too vague altoget.her. It opens the door, as I have said,
ta ail sorts of discussions and con4zoversies, and gives no great chance of arriving
at anything that will be satisfactory ta anybody.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.: May I
giva my honourabla friend this illustration?
Assuming that a general clause which is
i.nserted in a special Act is superseded by
a corresponding clause in ithis Bill, which
is inconsistent with it, then the general
clause in this Bill would nlot apply, but
rather the general clause which had been
incorparated inta the special Act.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I quite sea that,
but sny difficulty is ini applying the words.
IIow is the judge who is ta deal with this
matter going ta detezrnine the exact mening of those words? 1 think I know what
iii intended, but it is nlot at ail clear.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: ls not this, the wording that the Privy Council had ta deal with
in the case af the city of Toronto and the
Taronto Power Company? When a special
Act caniers upon, a comlpany a substantive
righ., if it cornes into canflict with the general Act, the general Act giving it force
will take away the substantive right. Then
this clause provides that the special Act
governs. The Privy Couneil did flot haive
any difficulty. They simply said: - In order
ta gîve effect ta thîs, yau have ta -rule out
the general Act."

1S5

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: IL is
simply a repetition ai the wording ai the
aId Rail-way Act. IL says:
Tbe ecial .Act shail, in sa far as is nece,-sary ta give effect to such special Act, be taken
ta override the provistons of this .Act.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: I think the wording used by the honaurable gentleman irom
Middletan (Hon. Mr. Ross) is much clearer.
WVe can all understand what he said.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I am sorry ithat 1
cannot agree with the *honourable gentleman lrom Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt). We
warked at paragraph c for a considerable
time in the cammittea, and the hanourable
leader ai -the Govenment at, hast consented
ta paragraph c being stricken out. I ielt
that we were under obligation te him for
having agreed ta do that, and if I were in
the place of the honourable gentleman from
Ottawa, 1 shouhd say, "«I accept your apalogy," and should not raise any fuither
quesltion.
Paragraphec of section 3 was struck out,
and section 3, as amended, was agreed ta.
On subsection 3 of section 52-appeal ta
Supreme Court by heave ai Board:
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: When we last dealt
with this subsectian, I suggested thaît the
wvards " the Board " in the 20th line shauld
be replaced by the words "the Supreme
Court or three judges thereoi," and that
the words " and the granting of such leave
shaîl be in the discretion of the Board,"
cammencing in -the last line but one, be
struck out. Under this subsectian the leave
ta appeal upon a question of law is lait
entirely to the Board. Sa far we have had
a very good board. The chairmen especialîy have been invariably men ai very
high standing, sound judgment, and absolute]y trustworthy in every way. But we
rn.ay nat be as fortunate in the future as
we -have been in. the pat. It seamis ta mne
that it would be better ta pravide tha-t leave
ta appeal on a question of law should be
granted by the Supreme Court rather than
by the Board.
Hon. 'Mr. POWER: Wou]d nat that he
s prolongedi and expensivé method'
Hon. W. B. ROSS: The honourable gentlemian provides for appeals being heard
by three judges. When application i6 made
ta the Judicial Committea for leave ta appeal, it is not ta the full court, but practically ta only one man-.
'Hon. Nfr. BELOOURT:

Three.

SENATE
Hon. W. B. ROSS: 1 think it is a bad
principie ta leave the question of appealing ta the court that gives the judgment.
That la.-what would happen if the application for leave te appeal were matie to
t.he Railway Board. I am with the lionourable gentleman in thinking that the
appeal should be tsken f rom the Railway
Board and given to 'the 6upreme Court;
but I tbink the question of appealing
should be determined by a judge of the
Supreme Court of Can-ada in chainbers.
A great many duties are being cast upon
that court; why inultiply them? The
opinion of one judge of thse Supreme Court
upon the question as ta whe.ther or not
an appeal should be heard. is quite sufficient. If the honourable gentleman will
stibatitute -"one- for «' three"- I ivili agree
with him.
Hon. .Mr. BELCOUET: 1 t.hink it should
be laft 'bo one judge. In aur courts ques-tions of leave are generaUly decided by
one jutige.
8ub section 3
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK:
reada:
An appeai shalU aloo lie trom thse Board to

-If we are going ta make theml «et leave
.from the court, we do not require the wordè,
"which in the opinion of the board."
Hon. W. B. ROS: That should go out.
'Hon.. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: In subsection 2 leave ta appeial is given u'pon the
opinion o! one judge. Why shoulti it not
be the Mame in subetion 3?
Hoyn. Sir JAMES LOUG 1HEED. That is
on a question o! law.
,Hon. [Mr. -LYINOH-STAUNTOtN: It is al
a question of law.
«Hon. Mr. BELGOURTý Jurisdiction ia a
question of law.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEEBD: I should
like ta read the views expresz-ed by the
draffaman who "fram'ed 'this section. I
think they will appeal very st.rongly ta
honourable gentlemen. He says:
Strong representatiolis bave been made to
have power given to a Judge of tbe Supreme
Court to grant leave to appeal to the Suprenle
Court on any question of 1aw. At present, appeais can go to tbe Supreme Court upon questions of iaw oniy where thse Board ltseif gives
leave, whiie appeals on questions of jurisdictiofl
can go to tbe Supreme Court by leave of a
Judge of tbe Supreme Court.
It le climed tisat tbis arrangement ls inconv-enient. especialiy as tisere la often., as tbey say,
a good deai of confusion as to what is a question of iaw and what. a question of jurisdiction.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

I .think the question of juri8diction is
really a question of law. I do flot appreciate the distinction that Ls drawn between the twco, 1 think it would be reasonable to place them upon a parity. 1 will
proceed:
The request to Increase the rigbt te appeai

on questions of iaw raises Important conaideratiens. First, it la submitted that too great ease
and frequency of appeai wll be sure to Impair
the usefulness of the Board. Doubtless the present provisions of the AcZt were dratted with
this ln view, and it was nlot deemed desirabie
to leave the way open te go to the Supreme
Court continualiy on questions of law. It is to
be remembered that the right of appeal Is aiready wide open te the Governor in Council. A
difflculty as to the whoie matter is that the
Board desis with a very wide range of cases,
and whiie It might be no barm to leave the way
open te tihe Supreme Court where ail the litigants are weii able te bear the expense of thse
appeal, It might work hardship In the case of a
weaithy litigant against a poor one.

As honourable gentlemen familiar with
the working out of this Act doubtiess know,
the board travel from the Atlantic to the
Pacifie. They go into a community and
hear a fariner or any small owner who has
a grievance against a railway company. and
they adjudicate upon the matter and decide
it there and then. Consequently, if you
give a wide..open right of appeal ta rail-way
companies as ag-ainst smail holders or amal
i'nterests, you at once encumber the administration of the Act to such an extent
as to rentier it most inconvenient. The smal
holder or the owner of small interests cannot afford to follow the matter up to the
Supreme Court. If t.he matter is of sufficient importance to warrant an appesl, the
board is not going to withhold its leave if
it is manifest that injustice will be done
by so doing. Furthermore, railway corn.parties have their rernedy in an appeal te
the Governor in CGouncil. The draftsman
continues:
Again, the Board la not essentiaiiy a court

of iaw. Il may be compared more as regards
the nature of its jurisdiction (but nlot, it is
hoped, is procedure) te the oid Court of ChanVery often It may not be desirabie to
cery.
appiy the rigidity of strict iaw, and as the reai
merits of thse case, witbout disrespect to It must
surely be said that the Board ls iikeiy to be
better quaiied ln thse case to judge than the
Suprerne Court.
It bas been tbought best nlot to Increase thse
right of appeai on questions of iaw. but ln order
to meet thse difficuity of confusion of matters
of iaw and matters of juriediction. subsection 3
bas been amended so as to give the Board thse
rlght to give leave to appeal on a question of
jurisdiction as weii as a question of law. and
thus avoid double application for leave m-here
it Is destred to appeal upon botis grounds.

APRIL 18, 1918
This section is largely the outconie of the
experience of the Inteistate Commerce
Commission iýn the United States, wheie,
when the Act was, first enacted, the righit
was given cf appeal from the commission
te the Supreme Court cf the United States.
The working of the Act there became se
clogged by thie numerous appeals made that
the efficiency of the Act was destroyed. In
fact, I arn told that eome appeals were
held up as long as ten years. I believe this
accords -with the experience of moat lawyers
wherever there is extensive machinery permitting appeals. I th.ink it is in the interests of the public, particulaîiy the emaller
interests, that this section should remain
as it is.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: An honeurable
gentleman reminds me that when we discussed this Act some years ago we' came te
the conclusion that it was better te restriet
the appeals.
Hon. Mi. BOSTOUK: Can the honeurable gentleman say how many appeals there
have been? Has the board bepn in the habit
of allowing them?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: It is net proposed te
give an unlimited right cf appeal. That-is
juat as restricted as ever. The only question here is whetheî leave te appeal is te be
granted by -the beard itself or by an independent body. If the leave te appeal were
allowed in every case, I ceuld understand
the aigumeLit we have just heard.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I draw the attention of my honourable friend te the fact
that the board is much more farniliar with
the whole question-the importance and
impertunity of the appeal, and the injuiy
which may be inflicted either upon the individual or the public if it is net granted.
It seems te me that there is reasen for leaving the granting cf tappeals te the Boa/rd instead, of transferring it te a new body or
te a person wha knows nething cf the 'whele
situation, but te whom is submitted only a
certain f act or a peint of law.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: What happens when
yen ask a judge cf the Supreme Court cf
Canada for leave te appeal? 'Yeu have te
point eut the nature cf the injustice. The
judge is then in a much better position te
form an opinion as te 'whether somethinginequitable has been doue than is the Railway Board.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I amn told
that the Railway Board have neyer refused
an applicant leave te appeal, except in pes-

187

sibly one case. That, I think, is the highest tribute that can be paid to the wisdoni
of Parliarnent in framing the Act.
-Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I agree that the
right of appeal should- not be any more
extended than it la; but if we change sumbsection 3 so as to make it read, "'leave frorn
the Board," there will be a cosifliet with
subsection 2. As 1 understand subsection
2. it providea for an appeal without the
con-sent of the Board, on ail questione
of jurisdiction. Subsetion 3, if amended eas
suggested. will provide that a judge of the
Suprerne Court may grant an appeal on
questions of law or questions of juriidition if, in the opinion of the Board. ther,
are such.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: That is only concurrent jurisdictîon.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It would be confiicting jurisdiction. Subsection 2 aays that
on ail questions of jurisdiction there may
be au appeal; then in subsection 3 you say
there may be an appeal if the board grant
leave.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: An application may be -made to a judge cf the,
Supreme Court. Now, suppose the judge
refuses an appeal on a question of juriadietien, the coxnpany is stili permitted te make
application. te the Board for the right te
appeal te the Court on a question cf jùrisdiction.
Hon. Mi. BBIMUBRT: That is not My
point; peihaps I did net make myself clear.
Under subsectien 3 there can be -no appeal
by leave of the judge on a question of
jurisdiction unlesa the Board has previensly stated that in its opinion it is a question cf jurisdiction; whereas, under subsection 2, that right cf appeal exists independently, whatever may be the opinion
of the Board in the matter. Surely there
is a confliot there.
Hon. Sir JAMBS LOUGHEED: One is
an appeal by leave of a judge, and the
other is an appeal by beave of the Board.
Hon. Mr. BEiLCOURT: My suggestion
would be that we eliminate ail reference
in subsection 3 te juriediction, in eider te
avoid the confliet.
Hon. Mi. ÏDÂNDUELAND: I wonder why
that question of juriadiction is tieated
again in subsection 3.
-Hon. Mi. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Let me
point eut what this xneans in practice. If
I have te apply. te a judge of the Supreme
Court, that means that, if I arn a resident

SENATE
of British Columbia, or Nova Scotia, or
any other far-efi place, I have to inst.ruct
a lawyer in Ottawa to appear on the
motion, or I must appear on my ewn behall. I arn thus put tW a great deal of
expense over perhaps a trifling matter. On
the other hand, the Board goes ail over
the country; it is a peripatetic Board. I
eau write the Board a letter about the
appeal, and there will be no formai pro* cedure like that of a court of law. It would
be putting a very grave burden on an
ordinary person to require that etvery timae
he deeiree te appeal he *muet instruct a
lawyer in Ottawa to attend te it for hlm.
It might inake the cost so great that one
would net want to make application.
Hon. Mr. BOSTNXCK: To whom would
the appeal be made under subsection 3 ?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Supposing that an order bas been made by the
Railway Board, and I want te appeal to
the Supreme Court. My lawyer can write
a letter to the chairman of the Board making certain representations, and asking that
the Board grant leave te appeal to the
Supreme Court. iRe grants that applicatien or he refuses te grant it; but if my
application hais te go before a judge in
chambers, and I muet empioy a lawyer
te appear. before the court, he will send
me a nice bil of ceets. That is the difference.
Hon. ÎMr. POWER: It seems W nie the
two clauses are intended te provide for two
Wotally different cases. Subsection 2 provides, I take it, for the case where the
board had declined to. allow the appeal:
An appeal shall lie from the Board to the Supreme Court of Canada upon a question of jurisdiction.

Then sub section 3 says:
An appeal shall aise lie from the Board to
such Court upon any question which in the
opinion of the Board is a question of iaw./

The Board may be anxious te be satisfied as te what the nature of the question
is. In the et.her case the Board rnay Te,
fuse the appeal, and then the party who
feela himself aggrieved can appeal to. the
Supreme Court. As I say, I thiu.k that the
twe clauses are intended te provide for two
differeut cases, and that they are both
nece6sary.
Subsection 3 of section 52 was agreed te,
and the section was agreed Wo.
On section 42-employment of counêel in
public interest:
Hýon. Mr-. LYNCH -STAUYNTON.

Hon. Mr. NIC4HOTiLS: Honourable gentlemen, I have been asked by the Toronto
Board of Trade te submit the follo'wing:
The Toronto Board of Trade submits that if
any matter before the Raiway Board is of
sufficient Public importance to iead the minister
to appoint counsel to represent the Government
or the public, it ought not te be necessary to
malce any provision allowing the Board to
order payment of such counsel's feçs by any
party to the application, and the Board of
Trade desires to point out that this mnight be
a very serious burden t o mre private appUicant
The Boar-d of Tl'rade takes the view that if the
minister thinke it necessary to appoint couiisel
In the public Interest, the Government should,
as a matter ef course, assume the burden of
that expense.

That seeme te me te be a very reasonabie
request. If the Government take action on
their own initiative, they should. o4fcourse
assume the expense. I have been asked
te submit that on behaif of the Toronto
Board of Trade.
What amendHon. Mr. BOSTO.CK:
ment dees my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Nichoils) propose tie make te the clause?
Hon. Mr. LYNOH-STAUNTON:
etrike eut the 'words:

Just

and thie So..yd my direct that the oost of such
counsel shall be pald by any party to the application., prooeeding or zoatter, or by tihe Minister

of Finance out of any unaWpropriated, eneneys.
Hon. tMr. BOSTOCK: 'Why should it

If those
Hon. Wfr. LYNCH-STAUNTON.
words are net included, the Governinent
must pay their own coets.
Hon. Mr.. BOSTOCK: Why should it not
be leit te the judgment of the Board
whether they should psy or not?
Honi. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Recause
the applicant has no'thing to say as to the
appointment of couinsel, aud it is an old
principle of la'w that the Crown neither
takes nor gives costs, and if the Crown appoints counsel the Crewn should bear that
expenee. I believe it is a very just and proper suggestion.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: Further than that, the
section itself shows that it is on.ly in a case
where the matter would be eue of public
interegt. The matter being of public interest, I do net see how there could be any
justification for saddling the costs on a
private individual. Ail the words from line
the end should be struck eut.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do flot know
what the practice is in other -countries, but
I was surprised to find in the law courts in
France in ordinary civil cases a person aitting a few fée away from the bar and the
judges, listening to the -whole proceedinga,
and rising after the attorneys had given their
interpretation, of the law to ask for an adjournrnent ini order that lie might arrive at
conclusions in the public interest. There ii~
before every court a representative of the
state who may corne to any kind of conclusion on the interpretation of ail Act.

such stock, shares. bonds or other securities.

if this amiendmiefit ies made, a railway
company couid in(ve6t in and hold the miajority of the stock of a siall local lino,
which would set as a feedýer to the conipany, in a particular province, and yet the
safeguard that is -contained ini this Act
against niergers o'! important couipanies
would -stilà1 remain.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I would
ask the -honourable leader of the Government 'te give us the reason why it le proposzed te perpetuate the lav again6t a cernpany !being entitled te ibuy its ownsecurities. I have known xnany cases in. which
it la moist desirable for a company to be able
to buy its own securitiesl. A conipsny may_
be proeperous and -may have outstanding
bonde or securities whieh it %viz-bes te re-

tire; and, as to the stock, irj these daye
when we have se mrnuch watered stock, the
company miay con.sider it desirable to retire
a lot of ceramon stock, and it may be in
the interests of the comnpany to 'buy ito own
stock. I have neyer been able to understand what le the evil to be guarded against
by preventing a company from retiring- its
own stock.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Lt le not only
*stock; the section refers te shares, bonds or
other securities.
.Hon. W. B. ROSS: 1 wish. to say, regarding the question of a company buying ite
own stock, that the, House of Lords has decided that in the a'bsence of specifie statutory power no compafly can buy its own
stock. I do flot eee the necewsity of this
clause at ail; for if 'there le one thing certain in coqupany law, it is that a company
cannot DUY its own stock unlesa it -lias a
speciflo statutory power to do it. That is
al that this section deals with.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: No.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Yea, 1 amn speaking
,with regard to a ornpany .purchasing ite
own stock. To purchase the stock is to,
make away with xnoney 'which exists for
the benefit of creditore. Take, for instance,
a compan.y that lias. $1,000,000 o! etookf500,00 due te creditore, -and $500,000 ini cash
on hand. That money should go to psy the
existing creditors or possible oreditors in
the future, and should not go to the purchase of stock, whjch. would put up the
value of the stock and leave the existing
or future creditors out in the cold. The
very creation of a company -with stock
makes the stock and what cornes frorn itthe cash that is paid for lt-a fund for the
protection of creditors, and there is absolutely no_ necessity for us to say that, a
cornpany shall not buy its own stock. Now,
oorning to the other part <>fthe clause:
Or in the acquisition of any shares, bonds or

other securities issued by any other railway
company, or In the purchase or acquisition of

any Interest In any such stock, shares, bonds or
other securities.
I do not see why we should puit that in,
because, unless it is a bad purchase, what
the coonpany buys is the prowperty of the
company, stili avaîlable for creditors. There
is only one possible argument that I can
see to justify the latter bal! of this section, and that la that it is meant ito prevent
niergers. I do noît know that that should
be done. I have seen a purchase of a very
sinall company by a big comipany, %vliieh

SENATE

was simply a Godsend to the people who
live aiong -the Uine of a wretched, half-dead
littie Ene of railway. That occurred rig.ht in
euir own part of 4ihe ceuntry. Take, fer inistance, the Annapolis Valley Uine that run8
230 miles fromn Halifax to Yarmouth. The
Canadan Pacific railway bought the bonds
and preferred stock. They ovrn prebably
two-thirds or three-fifths of ail the securitis. They are in possession of that road,
and as a resuit great imnpreivements have
been mnade in the line ail the way between
Halifax and Yarmouth. Every -bridge hias
been Tebuilt, and the whoie line bas been
relaid. If the Canadian Pacifie railway had
not acquired these etocks and bonds and
geL possession of the company, I arn as certain as I arn of anything on earth thaît that
railway would not noir be in operation. I
do net believe in this proposed legisiation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Does xny hionourable friend accept my amendmnent, which
would allow the buying ef stock?
Heu. W. B. ROSS: I would move that
the whole section 147 be struck out. The
first part of it is net wanted and the second
hall of iL is bad.
Heu. Mr. DANIEL. In regard te that
section, I do noît think iL bas ever been
put in force. I know very well that in my
own city, as the henourable gentleman frorn
Fredericten (Hon. Mr. Thernpson) knows,
the Canadian Pacifie railway bought out a
smail Une xunning ever the St. John river.
It was epenly dene. The Canadian Pacific
Railway bought the majority of the shares,
and they now practically own the line. I
presume that, as this section is sirnply a
copy ef the section in the Revised Statutes
it was the law when that transaction toek
place. So, as a maitter ef fact, it is not
observed at ail at times.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May I
expiain? If section 147 is ýsimply a deciaration of the lau- as it exists, as has been
pointed out by the honourable gentleman
fromn Middleton (Hon. W. B. Ross), it does
no harrn to allow that declaration to appear
4n the statute.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: What good does
it do?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is
neeffl«rn, for this reason. The language
wÎihi be seen in the statute: -"Except as in
thâs Act or the special Act otherwise provided, ne company sh-al" do so and so.
Hion. 'Mr.- BOSTOCK: Those words are
added, are they not?
Hon. Mlr. W. B. ROSS.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We give
to railway companies certain powers in
cVher tetions of the statute, -whieh possibly
*may be construed ito mean that they would
have the right to do semething of this kind.
Heu. Mr. BELCOURT: They maight have
that right under thoir speelal charter.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But 1
would point out to the cernmittee 'wherein
this power could be abused to the extent
of practically wiping out the capital or the
bonds o.f a railway cenipany. Let us assume
that a gzoup of shareholders in a cornpany
hold a very suibstanal part of the stock. If
the company lias; a cash reserve reprqesenting
a certain aineunt of money, thet cash reserve should be available for the payment
of the conmpfny's debts-for the creditors.
Let us aseume that, by putting the money
into the puTchase oef tiheir own 6tock, tha4
mîght be wiped out, with their obligatio-nq
unpaid. They could in that way loot the
treasury of the reeerve, and the creditors
ight have nothing, because the road
might be bonded for its entire voalue.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: By cenverting the
cash in band into stock.
Hen. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yevs.
That stock is put into the treasury. It
would not be worth the paper it is written
on. In section 147 it is provraded that the
coxnpany shall not acquire t.he shares, bonds
or oither secuxdtiee isoued by any other railway cempany, o1 employ any oi its fund-,
an the purchase er acquisitden of any interest in any euch 6tock, shares, bonds or
ather securities. It may be very undesirable
that a large company shouild have the
power, by going inte tihe stock market, te
swaUelw up soine, small comrpetitor, -which
AL
might very readily de. Otîher sections of
(the Bill make provisi<>n fer a company te
acquire subsidiary roads or other roads in
a paricular way, and it seemis to nme that
that maehinery is quite ample to meet the
situation te which iny honouirable friend
from Middleton (Hon: W. B. Ross) hias
referred, and it has worked %atisfactorily
in affordiing assietance to ether roeds; but
a cenîpany sheuld not do tihat by geing
ixvto the nmarket and buydng up the ehares
or bonds o4 the other railroad, thu-s poesibly
ohhiterating or cri.pphîng a competiter who,
in the publie dnterest, elheuld remain.
Hon. Mr. CAOGRAIN: Is it flot the fact
that in the past a railroad company c7buld
not seli te another, and that one railroad
couid not buy another witbout an Act of
Parliarnent?' 1 have had somnething to do

APRIL
with railroads in years gone by, and it
seeme to me that flot only had the purchasing company to get an Act authorizing
them to buy, but the Act of the selling
comnpany had to be amended ta authorize
them to Bell. I was noV aware that it had
ever been otherwise.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Power
must be gîven ta a company to buy.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: My honourable
friend did not deal with the amendment
proposed by the honourable gentleman from
De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand). If I
un.derstand it aright, it would limit this
clause Vo railway companies. coming within
the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada. As the clause stands at present, I understand that it would prevent a conpany
like the Canadian Pacific railway company fromi buying up the shares of a littie
conipany incorporated under the laws of a
province.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It might
be 'very desirable thet they should flot be
permitted ta buy up either a federal or a
provincial road. If it ie a wholesâme doctrine when applied Vo a Dominion road,
there is no reason why it should noV be
wholesoxne when applied to a provincial
road.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I drew a distinction between a company purchasing the
stock of another concern and forming a
dangerons mergeT, and a company buying
out a amal company -which would act as
a feeder to the larger company. That is
why I thought we should perhaps give some
leewemy for the purchase of stock in railwaye not under the jurisdiction af Vhe Parliament of Canada.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If a company ha. power under its charter to acquire
provincial roads. or even foreign roads, it
xnight do so. There is machinery in this
Bill Vo carry that out.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Section 155 provides
for the acquisition of other companies. Take
the case of the Dominion Atlantic.
Hon. Mr. BELGOURT: The honourable
g-entleman will gret ail th-at he needs out of
section 151.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will not iiisist on my amendment.

On subsection 6 of seotion 151--railway
affected declared for general sdvantage o!
Canadla:
Hon. 'Mr. BOSTOCK: I think my honourable f-rîend was going to allow that to
stand. I underatand that that subsection
,was struck out before the Committes of
the Sen8Ve last session, and that it has been
put tin again. Rl VhinGc *he honourable
gentleman f rom De S.alaberry <Hon. Mr.
Béique) wanted to apeak on it. I do not
remember what objections he raised againet
it fbefore the committee, but I would ask
the leader oi the (iovernment to allow it
to stand.
One of the
H<m. Mr. DANDURAND:
points raised was that, by reason. of the
enaotment of a igeneral Aot, railways sold
or leaaed, in whole or in part, would coame
automotically under the jurisdiction of the
Raihîway Board. IV is questionable whether
we should atteanpt Vtobring under federal
jurisdiction railroads which are leased iii
whole or in part, and which retain their
identity and their provincial charter
powere. The question was raised on conetitutic'nal grounds. 1[ zuggest 'that we

Up later if we are noV pressed Vo corne oui

Subseotion 6 o! section 151 stands.
On section 184--provisions applicable.Hon. tMr. NIOHJOLLS: I have another
memorandumn from the Toronto Board of
Trade dealing with sections 184 and M?.
1V says:
The Board of Trade points out that these sections commencing with 184 provide for filing
plans, profiles andi books of reference, andi the
deposit thereof with the Registrars of Deede for
the counties or districts where the lands to be
taken are eltuate, but that there As no provision compelling the rallway to take the lands
once they have recorded these plans, profiles
and books of reference. The resuit As there is
notice to ail intendlng purchasers »on file in the
office of the Landi Registrar to the effect that
the lands are to be taken by the ralîroaci. whlcb
resuits in it being impossible to deal wlth the
,andi, to seil At or to lease At nor As At any longer
in a position where a prudent business man
would venture to build upon At or Amprove it.
Ultlmateiy the railroad, after keeping hlm in
this position for an Andefinite length of time,
may decide not to take the landi, and there As no
provision for any ompGematdlon te thie owner for
the injury thus donc hlm. The Board of Trade
fe els that the railroad ought to know before
registering any indication of its Intention
against any person's landi that At does In fact
require the land,. andi that w1thîn a very limiteci
time At shoulci be cither bounci to, remove the
registration and release the landi or to take Atandi
pay for It, and the Board of Trade thinks Abat
six months would be an extremely reasonable

SENATE

Instead of

that, it is evident from Section 221 that the Act
contemplated that the railroad might keep the
land tied up for more than a year, and yet the
only remedy is that in that event the arbitrator
shall assess the damages as of the date of the
actual taking of the land; but as far as the
Board sees there is nothing in the Act providing
for the event lndicated above, that is, providing
for the railroad declding nlot to take the land
after keeplng It tied up as above Indlcated, nor
is there any limitation te the length of time
for whlch the titie of the owner can be kept
under the cloud occasloned by such registration.
Beth these things ought te be remedied.
The Board of Trade suggests that the remedy
mlght take the form ef a clause provlding that
unlesa the rahlway company causes the registratien of the plan, profile and book of reference
te be vacated and removed front the register
withln six months from the time of Its registratien. the railway company shall be bound te
take the lands shown on sucli plan, profile or
book of reference; the object. of course. being
te force the rallroad In some way te elect elther
to actually purchase or to clear the owner's
titie within the period of 6 months.

I amn unable te say whether six inonths
iz a fair and reasonable time; but I do

net hesitate te say that it is moBt unfair
to allow land to, be practically preempted
for an indefinite length of time when it
may neyer be taken at ail. There should
bc some time limit.
Hon. Sir JAJMES LOUGHEED: 11ay I
point out that the sections f rom 180 to
IS4, inclusive, deal with branch lines not
exceeding six miles in length. Section 171

land, and if my henourable friend wifl turn
te subsection 3 ef that section, he will find
that the cempany has twelve months withW wvhich te take the land. It seems to
mie that this provision would likewise apply
ti, branch lines.
Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS: My attention had
net beein directed te these sections, and no
doubt the attention ef the Board of Trade
has net been directed te thein. From a hasty
reading of section 171 it appears te me that
it c1overs the around, the enly difference
being that. the -limitationi is one year instead of six rnonthis. I would ask that this
clause be suspended until 1 have ait opportunity te, look it over more carefully.
Subsection 6 ef section 151 stands.
On section 232-appeal frein sward:
Hon. 6ir JAMES LOUGHEED: Why was
this section suspended?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Te see if an appeal should be granted frein the decision of
the judge. I thifnk the henourable gentleman frein Middleton (Hon. W. B. Ross)
was te draft a clause.
Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS.

Hon. W. B. RO&*S: 1 thoughit the henourable gentleman frein De Salaberry (Hon.
Mr. Béique) was dealing- with that. He
thought there should be an appeal on a
question of law.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Subsection 3 provides for an appeal.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Then, the
question is -whether section 232 will be necessary, inasrnuch as, we ainended the Bill by
ietriking- eut the clauses authorizing proceedfings te be taken before arbitrators. We
proposed appointing. the county court judge
as an arbitrater. It seema te be unnecess.ary
te allow an appeal frem the county court
judge te some other judge.
Hon. '-%r. DANDURAND: 0f the saine
court.
Hon. Sir JA'MES LOUGHEED: Yes, unless we limit the appeal.
Hon. Mr. DANDURA.ND: As a judge ef
the Superior Court would act as arbîtrator,
we felt that it 'would net ;be right te allew
an appeal te a judge ef the same courtthat i! an appeal were te, be allowed it
should be te a higher tribunal.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: The appeal is te
the Superior Court judge.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In our province
there is ne county court.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: In view ef the opinion of the honourable member from De
Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique) Li which I
acquiesce, I subnîit this arnendnîerit:
Amend. section 2.32 by adding, s.lter the word
"court" in the tenth uIne of the section, the
*'or -te the court Of lest resort of the~
wos
province in whI4ch the lands lie, if a judge of a

That would work eut in this .v-ay. .On a

befere a ýSuperier Court judge, an appeal
is granfted only when. there is a defect on the

if a jud-ge makes a mistake in figures or in

re-trial or rehashing of tbe evidence. It .is
rather a summary proceeding on dlaims up
to $600.
Hon. .Mr. POWER: I would like to ask
if the honourable gentleman from Middleton, in drafting this amendment, bas considered the cases of New Brunswick and
cerne of the western provinces, whiere there,
are supreme« courts and courts of appeal.
Under the axnendment as read by the hionourable gentleman the asppeal from a
county court judge would be to the court
of appeal, and not to the supremfe court.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGH-EEfl: Here is
the amendmnent which wc made to 'section
219, -with consequential amendments in the
subsequent aectionse:
Eitber party may apply to the judge of
the coun-ty court of the county In whbch. t.he
lands lie, or, in the province of Quebec or in
any other part of Canada where there is no
county court, to a judge of the superior court
for the district or place In w*hich the lands lie.
to determine the conWensation to be pald as
afore-%ald.
-It seem6 to me that this would apply in
ail parts of Canada, that is to say, where
there are county court judges or district
court judges.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
court judges; but if there be a ceunty
court judge or a district judge, lie mu6t be
the arbitrator.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: You have
district judges in Quebec, have you not?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: There are district
judges in Quebec, but they are called
magistrates.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: In Saskatchewan and Alberta we have district
judges; we have no county court judges.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: Suppose we change
this fromn "judge of a stiperior court" to
"judge or dic-trict magistrate."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But we have
districts where there are no district
inagistrates.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: But you have a judge
of corne kind?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes; a judge
of a supPrior court.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Why not niake it
"judge or district magistrate"?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: What about appeal
frorn a county court judge?
Hon. W. B. BROSS: Leave out the words
"superior court."
S-13

Hon. Mr. BELCOTJRT: If you take out
the words -superior court" you wvi11 be in
d ifficulty.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: In the province of
Queibec you have eithe-r a judge or district
magistrate; so we rnight say, "if a judge or
a district -magistrate bas been constituted
arbitrator."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I was quite
satisfied with the arnendrnent.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I think the
amendment should go just as iA was read.
The amendinent of Hon. W. B. Ross was
agreed to, and section 232, as amended, was
agreed to.
On section 251-bridges, tunnels and
other structures where length exceeds 18
feet:
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Sub section 1 of
this section provides that "construction, or
reconstruction of or any material alteration
in any bridge, tunnel, viaduct, treistle, or
other structure," cannot be proceeded with
except in accordance with standard plans
already approved by the board. Objection
lias been taken te that on the ground that
frequently, particularly in cities and towns,
conditions change between the time of the
original construction and the tirne when
reconstruction is necessary. I have in
nîind one case where, in order te
a railway
facilitate the entrance of
into my own fown in the West, the city
consented te the construction o! the cheapest kind o! a pile bridge over 'what was
regarded as a piece of ornamental water.
This was not done without a good deal of opposition, and in thait case certain conditions
wvere laid down. Under section 251, if it
wvere to be carried. out as it is drawn, one
stage of the consent required would be
w~hen the tirne of reconstruction came; yet
the company could proceed te reconstruct
on exactly the sanie lines 'as the original
structure, without aily notice te the municipality or the board. In order tu guard
ag-ainst that I would mjove an -amendînent
as follows:
That subsection 1 of section 251 be stricken
eut and the foliewing inserted in lieu thereof:
The company shahl not. within the limits of
any incorporated city or town, or where its uine
of railway crosses a highway, whether within
or without such limits, commence the constructien or reconstruction of or any material alteratien In any bridge, tunnel, viaduct, trestle, or
other structure, through. over, or under which
the company's trains are to pass, the span, pr
preposed span or spans, or length o! which exceeds elghteen f eet, until leave therefor has
been obtained f rom the Board; but the corn-

construction, reconstruction, or alteration at any
place beyond the said limita if such construction,'
reconstruction or alteration is flot at a highwýay
crosslng, and la in accordance w ith standard
specifications and plans approved by the Board.

I understand thet the reference te the
highway croasings, was inserted in this
amendment at the request of the Railway
Department and the Board of Railway Coinmissioners.
The amendment -%as agreed te, and sectien 251, as amended, was agreed te.
On section 325-disallowance of tariff:

let me tell you another reason why this
clause should not pass. At a later date
the Manitoba Governient acquired the
Northern Pacific, a road. that had been
givien a cash bonus o! $1,750 a mile to iniduce it to, corne into Manitoba. That road
.wae purchased f roni the Northern Pacifie
company. by the 'Manitoba Government land
turned over to the CanacQian Northern. Railway company as part of their property.
There was another guarantee given in that
case. In coneideration of the transfer o!
the Northern Pacific te the Ganadian
Northern Railway company, a reduction
was secured to the .peo'ple of Manitoba cf 4
cents per 100 pouid.s on wheat from Winni.peg to Lake Superior. Paragraph a cf section 8 cf the Act confirming the agreemient
provides:
Reductions amounting together te, more than
four cents per hundred pounds on the tariff
ratee in force on the date of said indenture for
the carniage of grain from Manitoba to a Lake
Superior port.

Parag-raph b cf the saine section reada:
Reductions amounting together te more than
fifteen per cent of the tariff rates in force on
the said date for the carniage of ail other
freight from and te points in Manitoba, and
f rom and te points la Manitoba to and fromn
Fort Williamn or Port Arthur.

That was te last for 30 years. Twenty
years o! the period bas elapsed, and the
guarantee stili hias ten years te run. Manituba bas been einjoyi-ng the ibenefit cf that
reduction ever Qsince that contract was
madle. There is also contained in the Act

Northern, a renewal of the pledge from, the

trust that this miatter is so clear and plain
that the ;Senate wiil flot accept the amendment whicn hias been 6uggested, by the
honourable leader of the House.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: The honourable member from Portage la Prairie (Hon. Mr. Watson) has covered the ground pretty well. I
think the honourable leader ef the Government would be well advised to withdraw
this amendment. It 'would be a very great
hardship to Manitoba. I arn certainly very
much against it.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I als9o object very
strongly to the amendment which has been
proposed. I object chiefly on the grounds
set out by the honourabie gentleman from
Portage la Prairie. Manitoba and the West
have had a bard time in trying- te settie
their railway problems, and they have taken
upon themnselves a great deal o! responsibility. They have had to fight alone, unaided, and when they have entered into an
agreement such as that refe-ed to by the
hionourable member for Portage la Prairie
it should not 'be interfered. with by this
House.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: I have had a communication from the Government of Manitoba stating that it -would like to m-ake
representations on this matter if there is
time. But it seems to nme that the amendment pro-posed is so manifestly unfair in its
retroactive effect that we oug-ht te pass the
section without considering that amendment further. If the Government of Manitoba sent a deputation here to miake representations this would mean additional expense. I respectfully submit that we ought
to pass the section without fur.ther consideration of the amendment.

-Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: May I point
out ta the honourable leader of the Government that, la the event of his acquieseing in the suggestion which has been made
by the honourable gentleman from Portage
la Prairie (Han. Mr. Watson), a like invitation should be extended ta the provinces f arther west. When the Railway
Board made its rather f amous decisian regarding freight rates in the West, it was
necessary, under a clause in the Act, to give
to Saskatchewan a rate proportionate to
that which was fixed for Manitoba. If
Manitoba were now ta be put in a special
class and in consequence ai its special bargain with the Canadian Northeru railway
were to get a better rate than any of the
provinces iarther west, the rates for the
West would be entirely disarranged.
The amendment ai Hon. Sir James

LOUGHEED:

What

would my honourable iriend sug-gest in lieu
ai this section?

Han. Mr. RICHARDSON: I would suggest that aIl tariffs and supplements dating
back for 20 years shouid be done away with
and replaced by a new tarif ; and that there
should be a new tariff iesued ta the public
once a year. It would 6ave the railway
companies endiess trouble. It would be
not only ta the advantage oi the railway6,
but also ta the advantage of the cornmunity.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I can
very well understand the confusion which
niay arise froin an accumulation of tariffs
extending over a couple ai decades. If it
be true that the tariffs continue ta, be used
for that length o! time. my honourable
friend may see a solution of the difficulty in a eection providing that a tariff
sbould not remain basic, so. to speak, or be
supplemented, -for mare than 20 ye.ars.
Hon. Mr. RICHARDSON: I thin-k the
law sbould require that new tariffs be issued every year, in the month af August,
so that the shipperé3 may have them on
hand and know how ta arrange their buisinos s.

That seems to be perfe.ctly fair; it is

Every one who is not familiar with rates

SENATE
THE CASE 0F MIlS. FLORENCE DAILY.
Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. GEORGE TAYLOR: I wish to, draw
the attention of the Governinent to a case
of a very serious nature that has arisen
owing te 4*he war. 1 refer to, Mrs. Daily of
Gananoque, the widow of the late Timothy
Daily. At the time of her inarriage te Mr.
Daily she had a son of two or three years
of s.ge. Alter the marriage this son went to
live 'with the Daily fa.mily, who clothed
and fed him and sent hlm to, school. He
was a very clever. boy, and when lie was
twelve yesoes of age, he went to, work dn one
of the factories, where he reoeived a very
good wage. which. he carried home every
Saturday night and gave to, his mother.
He rexnsined at worlt until he was seventeen years of age. The boy was a musician,
a good bugler, and enlisted iii May, 1915.
as a ibugler, went overseas in March, 1916,
and was killed in September, 1916. Shortly
after the death of the boy, the steipfather,
Mr. Daily, was taken sick and died, leaving
M-rs. Daily w'ith a fa&mily of five, small
children.
I was -written.to in regard to the case, a.nd
brouglit it before the Pension Board, from
whom I received a letter, which I sent te
Mrs. flaily. It reads as iollows:
1 Ïhave the honour, by direction, t eknowledge reoelt of ian apicaoetion for pension
on your behaif on account of the death of your
son, the soldier marginally namned, and to lnform
you that it is not consldered that the evidence
subrnitted in support thereof establishes the
tact that you were wholly or rnainly dependent
upon the deceased ifor support at the tirne of
bis death, as 15 requlred by the Pension regulations te entitie you to pension.
It is regretted, therefore, that the claini canflot be favourably entertained.

When 1 came to Ottawa, I went before
the Pension Board and pre.sented Mrs.
Daily's dlaim, and received troni them the
folloiwing letter:
March 26th, 1918.
Senator George Taylor,
The Senate. Ottawa, Ont.
Sir,-I have. the honour, by direction, to refer
yeu te your recent cal at this office relative to
the dlaimn for pension of the mother ot the marglnally noted and to inforin yeu that the case
bas again been submnitted to the Commiissieners
for their consideration.
2. It Is regretted, however, that no additional
evidence bas been submnitted which weuld cause
the Commissioners te alter the decisien already
arrIved at viz.: that Mxrs. DaiIy bas net establehed the tact .that s5ie was wholly -or znalnly
diependnt upon ber deoeased. son for eupprt
at the timne of bis death, as required by the
Pension Regulations.
non. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

3. While the tacts show that probably the
burden of Mrs. Daly's support would have
fallen upen the shoulders of the deceased boy.
unfortunately the Pension Regulations make no
provision for the prospective dependency ot a
parent. It is hoped, bowever, that legisiation wll
soon be enacted givlng the Commissioners
power to award pension in such a case, wben
you may rest assured *that Mrs. Daily's claini
will recelve sympathetic consideration.
I have thle honour to be, Bir,
Tour obedient servent,
Stanley B. Coristine,
Secretary Board of Pension
Cemmissioners for Canada.

When this young boy enlis-ted he contributed $15 a rnonth assigned. pay, to, his
mother, which she received up to, the time
of his death. Had he li-ved, he would have
been the main support of the family. It
is true that. her husband had insurance on
his life to the extent of $1,000 in some
friendly seciety. It teck $300 to pay the
hospital and funeral and incidentai expenses, which left $700 with which to huy
ceai du-ring a veTy severe winter, and to,
madnîtain the family, but Mrs. Daily has
had to go out and do char work. I think
At is the diuty of the Government te have the
regulations so amended that the Compensation Board can deal with cases of this
kind. This country is tee big to, allow a
weman with a faniily of emali children to,
suifer in this way.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 1 would
say te my honourable friend th.at the case
te which he has referred is -a very regrettable ene; but the conditions are se changin- that it seems te have been impossible
for the Pension Board te, make provision for
ail the conditions, which. have arisen and
wliich may arise from time, te tirne. As my
heneurable friend doubtless knews, the
Pension Board is an independent body; it is
net influenced by the Government, or by
any department of the Government. It has
been placed upon an independent basis se
that it cannet be said that the beard bas
been subject to any influences. But, as I
amn informed, the Pension Board will from
time te time consider the new conditions
whicb are arising, and may possibly see
sorne way in the near future of meeting
such a situation as that explained by my
honourable friendý. While I do net commit
myself with respect te the situation, it i£
possible that this case may be brought te
a happy termination by the making of seme

in respect to the question of the use
af the different languages. I know the
feelings of the railroad cmployees who
speak both languages, and they are ail in
accord in this matter. Strange ta say, it is
because of the urgent representations made
since lest session ta the legisiative representatives of the various organizations by a
French Canadian railway employee that we
are asking that the proposed subsection be
not emrbodied in the Bill. I would point
out to honourable gentlemen that the proposed clause was originally intended to
refer only to the conductor of a train who
cornes into contact with passengers; but it
,goes mnuch further than that by declaring
that ail those who are employed on local
trains running ini the province of Quebec
shaUJ be conversant with bo'th the English
and French languages. There are to-day in
the province of Quebe-c many engineers,
firemen and baggagemen on local trains
who do not corne into direct contact with
passengers, and who cannot speak the
English language; yet they are permitted
to pass their examination in their native
language because they do not understand
English. I venture the statement-and
there are, within -ound of rny voice, men
who can confirm it-that there are on our
railways in the province of Quebec French
Canadian employees of 30 years standingHon. Mr. BELCOURT: The sooiner they
leamn English the better.
Hon. Mr. -ROBERTSON: -and who would
be -deprived of their positions if they were
required ta carnply with such a clause as is
propas.ed. No good purpose could be served
by passing such legislation. So far as I
kriow,

there

scarcely a canductor who cannot speak, Eng-lish fairly well. The train orders given on
aUl our Caniadian railroads are expressed in
the Eng.lish language; therefore, the -conductors must be able ta read and write English in order to accupy their positions.
There is scarcely a conduct-or in the province of Qnebcc who cannot speak enough
French to converse with the passengers
reasonably -well. So, in -addition to being
objectionable ta the English-speaking, railway employee who would be affected, the
clause would far more sêeriously affect the
French-speaking employees in the province
of Quebec.
Furthermore, only a few days ago our
attention was called ta this matter by men
employed in the railway service in British
Columbia, who expres-sed the fear that they
would be affect-ed if this proposed legislaHon. Mr. IMPTERTSON.

tian were passed and a knowledge of the
English languagýe were insisted upon before
a persan could be employed on a railway in
other provinces of the Dominion. They said:
" We cannot speak the English language
fluently, end wve fear this will strike us."
They are men who have left the province of
Quebec and are now engaged in the railway
service in western Canada.
I would further point out that neither the
employees nor the employers have ever
asked for any such regulation. May I çal
the attention of the committee to what I
believe is the cause of the introduction of
this proposal. The gentleman 'who intraduced it in the House of Commons a year
agao is not now in Parliament, and perhaps
I ought not ta make any direct reference to
what bis motives were; but I have studied'
the records of last session -and find that the
gentleman w~ho introduced the measure
gave n~o specific instance of any abuse which
justified its introduction. However, one
niember of the other House did make special
reference Vo a specific instance which in bis
judg-ment justified the introduction and the
passage af the proposed legislation. That
reference is repor-ted at page 3514 of Hansard of July 18, 1917. The gentleman -who
spoke was the Hon.,3Mr. Lemieux, who said:
Two cases were given a little more publicity
t.ha.n the others. One concernied nomne young
-boys comning home tram college, and the other
was a case of gross misconduct on the part of
a conductor on the Canadian Northern railway.
In the first instance, some students were going
from Rigaud ta Montreal. They were thrieatenied
with arr'est by the condaxotor of the train because they could not understand him. and he
insisted that they should understand hlm. The
doors of the car w-ere locked, and had it flot

been for the Intervention of a gentleman whase
naine w-as mentioned, those boys wauid have
been arrested when they reached Montreal. because. according ta the conductor, they had
refused to pay their fares. The case which
happened on the Canadian .Narthern was on a
new line In a new district. The conductor was
ignorant of the language of the passengers, and
an the occasion referred ta he handled very
raughly one of the passenirers who did not undei-stand hlm.

body ci students, aome thirty in number,
boarded the train ait Rigaud,.going home
for -the Christmas holidays, and deciined
to present their transportation ta the conductor on his request unless lie would 'converse with them in. the French language.
The conductor was an Irishman, 1 believe,
and, unfortunately for the harmony ci the
occasion, he did not feel like compiying
with that request, but x'espectfully urged
that they should produce their transportation to Montreai. Two stations down the
line the conductor informed the office at
Meontreal that lie haël thirty passengers who
declined ta psy lare or produce transportation, and ivhen those students were met at
Montreal by the proper officiais ta inquire
into the matter, one of them aitated that
they -had so acted en instructions from the
brotheT or tescher cf the school, who had
told theni before they left Rigaud that they
were not ta deliver their tickets unless the
conductor %vould s'peak tao thean in the
French language. Now, hon. gentlemen. I
submit that if lègisiaition of this sort is
enacted mitwill encourage exactly that sort
of thing, which wiIl &bemost unfortunate,
and detrimental to peace beitween 'the peopie cf these two provinces.
Hon. Mr. DkNDURAND: But the legislation only appiies ta local -frains.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I arn coming ta
that. While this clause would apply ta empioyees on local trains within ithe province of Quebec, I desire ta cali attention
teo the tact that many, in f act ail, local
trains runn-ing west and south out of Montreal run thraugh. territory other than the
province cf Quebec-either through the
province cf Ontario or threugh various
states of the United States. Trains betrween 'Montreal and Toronto are designated
local 'trains, yet same -of them aré tbrough
trains, running through the province af
Quebec for 30 miles and through the qprovince of Ontario for 300 milus. It appears ta
me that the people of Ontario would net
de.sire ta have a conductor on a train
running ail the w'ay froni Montreal ta Toranto who couid indistinctly spesk the
English language. The grievance would
be greater than it is at present.
Furthermore, there are certain American
railways cancerned-the New York Central,
the Central Vermant, -the Rutland, the
Delaware and Hud-son, the Boston and
Maine, and the Maine Central, every one
eof which ruins local trains ta the cities
of Montreil and Sherbrooke. I submit
that it is impossible ta *apply any sucli

203

rules ta those roads, which are under the
jurisdietion oif the United States, and I
question the jurîsdiction of our Parliament
ta say ta the United States: - Yen shail
employ Freneh-speaking conductors on your
own trains runnin-, within your own country." 0f course, that is impractîcable, because the terminal points are in the United
States, and a change of crews would be
impossible. This is why I submit that
thia matter should not be made contraversial, or lie included in the Act, particularly at this time-or at anby other time
for that matter. No hardship bas existed
by reason of the present conditions, which
have obtained for thirty yiears. JThis
clause would affect men whe have been
in raitway service for many years-because
I may explain that befere a railway empioyee can obtain a position in the passenger service he must have started as a
spare brakenian in freight service, and
have worked his way up and beconme a
freight conductor, and eventually a passenger conductor; and àt is only after years
of service that he is capable of taking
charge of one of those. passenger trains.
Therefore it would work a very great hardship on. many emplayees-not only Engiish-speaking, but aven more disastrously
French-speaking. This 'very day there is
in this city a conmnittee representing the
emnpioyees on one of our large railroads,
whic.h includes delegates from the province
of Quebec; and those delegates, Frenchspeaking men, brought this question before that committee only this forenoon,
and sent word ta their legisiative representative that they desired ta urge upon
us not te pass that legisiation, as it wvould
be ta the disadvantagçe of the men whom
they represented in the province af Quebec,
French-speaking Canadians. But, in addition te the effect oi sucli on the railway
employees,
international
complications
miglit arise, ewing ta the fact that neither
the employees nor the railway companies
have souglit this legîslation.
Another reason which I think ouglit ta
be taken into consideration at thie tine
ir. thet the British North America Act itself 'gives ta every citizen cf this country
the rîght te use and speak cither cf those
languages, the language cf his choice. I
think -section 133 of that Act makes that
perfectly elear, legalizi'ng the use of either
langu-age; and it would lie moist unfortunate
if without seriaus provocation Parliament

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

would hbave hbeen no ro-w in this case.
Hon. Mv. ROBERTSON: The faot is thaï
the first etaition 1beyond Rigaud where the
train stopped was Hudson. The boys were
told that they 'would have to present their
tickets, psy their fare, or leave the -train
at Hudson. They decided 'to do neither,
but stuck to the train, and the conductor,
jnstead of forcibly ejecting them, as the
rule would have permitted him to do,
adoptedi the other course, with the Tesult
that I have mentioned.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: Well, hie was too
lenient.

trains. My honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) bas spoken of the desire of the
railway employees to rnaintain the situation as it is, and not to add this amendment; but there is a very large constituency
whiich must be taken care of and conside-red, that is, the travelling public.
Railways and railway employees are muade
for the service o! the public. Now, I put
the question to my honourable friend.
what would that public say in any section
of Canada, hie it iBritish Columbia, Prince
Edward Island, or ini the middle provinces,
i$ on a local train running within a province froin one point to another, the coinpany had an employee who could not understand the language of the entire population,
or even 90 per cent o! it, in that section?
How long would hie remain on that train?

to have been accepted generally as fair.
It is not like the law of the Medes and
Pereians, that cannot be altered; it is aimply power given to the Railway Board,
on representation made, to declare that on
a certain local train employees should be
bilingual. My honourable friend says the
proposition works both waya. Certainly it
does, and the niinority in Quebec has rights

but if it happens that there is aomething

I siniply put the question. My honourable
friend Baya: -Things have gone smoothly,
and why introduce into this clause this new
principle?-' It is no new principle; it ia
the affirmation of what should exiat. We
have in the province o! Quebec tWO Taces

races shaîl be itreated wil.h fairness and

decide whether on certain roads a certain
class of ernployees-conductors, for instance

APRIL 19, 191S

This discussion
Hon. Mr. CLORAN:
proves that the two languages are necessary, nof only in social life, but in comnmercial, industrial, and every other kind of
life in Canada. It also proves that the peopie who are trying to suppress the knowledge o! French are doing- a grievous wrong
te 'this Canada of ours. Insfead c! aboiishing French they should be teaching it to
their children, and doing like the honourajble senator froin Sas.katchewan (Hon. Mr.
Michener). who said thdt he wa.s very sorry
thbat he had not had the opportunity of
Iearning that. language, but that when his

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I cail mhonourable friend's attention 4o -the fact
that I did net say that he should know
oniy one. I think I stated that every citizen
of Canada has the right to use the .language
of! his choice, either of the officiai languages.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: That is praoct.ically
the saine thing. You have a right to speak
French; I have a right te speak English.
But -suppose I go to you, a servant of a
public company, such as a railway, and
speak te you in English, and you do not
know English, what will you say? "Je ne
comprends pas." And I answer back, I
do not understand, eithex." WVhere are we
going to be? You have an absolutely con.
stitutionai xight to, use French, and you do
not know English; I have a right te use
Enghish, and I do nof know French. Who
is goàng te give in? We are both in the
treniches. An honouirable senator near mne
says, "'Do it by signs." But we are not

going to give in? Is if -the man who is
ap'plying r!or service in a company which
the law authorizes him to, appdy for? I staîte
this so -as to show the absolute necesaity of kno-wing the two languages if

arn not saying- that where there are no French
people whatever, or where there are very
few, a man should know the two languages
before obtaining a position in a publie coinpany; -but in the interests cf the company

that their servants in localities peop]ed

Rerterring ta Bill "-A," now under consideratian

Hon. Mr. CLORAN.

Legislative Boaard of the Bratherhood of L.oýcomotive Engineers, held in Ottawa, March 25April 6th, 1918, composed of representatives
from ail provinces in Canada, including tIre
province of Quebec, this matter was fully discussed. It was the unanimous opinion of tîtese
representatives that this propased legisiation
îvould result in a great hardshtp and injustice
ta a large number of experienced French Canadian emplayees in the (province af Quebtc, as
well as ta other Snaployecs In the course of
whose employment they would be requiîed ta
operate trains within and outside of tre province
of Quebec, and their repreaentative w-as instr-ucted ta enter the atrongest passible Itrotest

surrouniding- the eanployees. and the conditions of
train operatian, as welt as thre convenience ta
the travelling public, we are strongly of the
opinion tirat ne good pur-pase can be served. by
the proposed legislation, which, if enacted, arîd

enough to allow the matter to stand. He
hias brought a communication from the
railway employees of Quebec. 1 would like
tu~ endorse that. R will stand by the labour
unions ail the time, as long as they are
ini the right; but they ought to give Parliament a chance to see what is the strength
of that position and what will be its consequences. I quite agree with the honourable senator who has just taken his seat,
that we ought to be very careful in passing
laws that are going to effect future generations. There is no immediate hurry about
this matter. The province of Quebec, I
think, through its representatives in this
House, would like to have a word to say
on if,. I ar nft extreme in my views even
on this matter, and I arn prepared to
modify them, and to have the House of
Commons arnendment modified. It is absolute nonsense to ask a Frenchman who is
an engineer, and a good one, with probably
thirty or forty years of service, to give up
the handling- of his engine because hie canflot speak English; and if, would be equally
absurd to asIc an English fireman to give
up shovelling coal into the furnace because hie cannot speak Frenchi. But there
is sense in requiring- that the railiway eniplovees who have to deal with the public
should know the two languages. The liononrable gentleman froin Tantallon (Hou,

to observe that this was the first it-em,

and had those honourable gentlemen been
very seriously desirous of being here to deal
withi this ms.tter, they ought nlot to have

that the matter should be allowed. to stand

Th-en section 372 would deal with crossings
and section 372A wvould deal with wires that

Hon. Mr. BELC-OURT: What is the ditterence between the two?

The honourable memnber from Mille les
(Hon. Mr. David) asked nie to ispeak for
him on this point, becau6e we compared
notes. The subsection as it stands would
be unworkable in the province of Nova
Scotia, where we do not work by by-lawa,
and the honourable senator from Mille les
says he knows of hundreds of placer, in the
province of Quebec where it couid net be
worked. In the second place, 1 do noît
think it is correct legislation, for municipal
institutions are within the jurisdictien cf
the local legisiatures, and should say for
therneelves hoiv the consent is to be expressed; 1 do not think ive ought to dictate on that point at ail. We give them perfect protection when we say that their consetmust -be had.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: There is a decided objection on my part te requiring a
by-law on every occasion. For instance, a
telegraph company may '%vant te meve a
pole a few feet or yard-s, and in order to do
that iegally they would require te get the
consent of the municipality, which would
have te go through the formaiity cf passing
a by-law.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: As I understand
the amendment, it would leave the matter
entireiy in the hands of the municipal
counci], which weuid mean that in smail
niunicipalities the niatter %vould be ieft to

the section stands, if I understand At

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Or the

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: But notice inust be
given te the people generaily.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No. There
are two classes of by-laws--one ciass that
must be stibmitted te the people, such as
money by-iaws; but this does liot corne
under that class, but is an erdinary by-iaw
pasýsed by t.he municipal concil.
S-14J

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: There wouid be
more notice to the people if 'the consent
had to be expre&sed ýby by-law than if done
by the council by resolution.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It maight
be done by reso&lution or by-law. The people
*may not know anything about it even if
doue 'by by-iaw.
Hon. 2Nr. MACDONELL: The amendrnent
leaves the clause open, requiring only the
onsent of the, mun.icipality. The mover cf
the amendment statesl that by-laws are flot
used in hie province, and a sirnilar statenment has been made wiith reference te
Quebec; buit in Ontario and in the West
generaily, I think, the consent of the municipality can be given .by a committee of
council, and in m-any cases certain officiais
are clothed with sufficient authority, nomninally or prima lacie, to give the consent of
the municipality. Sitreet comnmissioners and
other officiais are empowered by by-laws or
rescolutiong to give or withhold consent with
reference to certain things connected with
highways and other matters. In Ontario,
an officiai eau frequentiy give the consent
of hie municipality. I think it would be
*higbly improper to leave the matter open
-for a mere official, perhaps of a large city,
to give the consent of the mur4icipa1ity on
a matter of very grave importance. I believe we are -&Il agreed that the municipality shouid %be coneuited and sho'aid consent; *but if we sîxuply say: -"the consent
,of the rnunicipaiity" and not "expressed
by by-4law," serious matters mighit be left
to the discret-ion of an officiai.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I wouid iike te ask
if it is net better to leave it in the hands
of the local iegisiatures cf the different prov-.
inces, which have jurisdiction over municipal institutions, te say w-hat shall mean
consent.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: That wo.uid require ail the provinces to begin Iegisiating,,
on a matter w.hich is created now. What
is the objection te leav.ing- the wcrds
-"expressed by -by-law ýý" As far a.s I knov,
a by-liw is rcquired in ail important
nia/ters cf that kind, xvhereas if the
question is le'ft sinîpiy to the consent cf a xnunicipaiity, there is neo
check or safeguuard se far as Ontario
is concerned. I sce no objection to the
word "by-la-%"
remaining in, because a
by-iaw can be passed by a council itseif in
five minutes if it is niereiy a pro forma
matter and ail the people in the community havé agrreed upon it. whereas the omnis-

212

SENATE

sion of that word would leave it to clerks
and officiais, which I think would be unIsafe and improper as well as quite unnecessary, berause the word "by-law" is timehonoured in legisiation of this kind. A
municipality can act officially only by byIaw.
Hon. Mr. POWER: The honourable gentleman frorn Toronto (Hon. Mr. Macdonell)
views the matter entirely from the Ontario
standpoint, -which I think is a failing of
Toronto people.
lion. Mr. MACDONELL: You cannot exclude Ontario.
Hon. Mr. POWER: There are certain
other provinces outside of Ontario in which
the consent of the municipality should be
as necessary as it is in Ontario. If the
words "expressed by by-law- are letft in
the subsection, in the province of Quebec
you could flot get any consent at ail, for
they have no by-laws, and consequently
cannot give consent.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: How have they
done in the past?
Hon. Mr. POWERi The people oi Toronto are very public spirited, at any rate
so far as Ontario is concerneti, and they
will see that ne consent is given except in
a way that meets with public approval. Se
there is no object at ahl in leaving in these

Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: Their case coulti

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Wben
you say the consent o! -the municipalities
shall be given, it would be held in Ontario that it would ibe doue by by-law. The
municipalities have it within their po-wer
to say ithat it ehall be doue by by-law or
by resolution. In Ontazjo there are only
two ways o! doing it, and wve leave it to

plicated. one. A man may suddenly awaken
to the fact that he has a dlaimi against the
ccmipany, that there lias been an imiposition of some toli which. he thinks is flot
correct, and hie at once launches an action
for triple damages. He may have a very
imperfect knu)wledge, -r nc knoiwledg-e at
ail, of what the tolls should be. As the
honourable gentleman from Kingston (Hon.
Mr. Richardson) has said, it requires a
man of considerable experience to famniliarize himself with tolls. 'Therefore, to pre'vent actions of this kind, it is desirable
Ïhat the board should say whether an
action wlll lie.
Hlon. lMr. BEDCOURT. As a niatter of
fact, the amount involved in most of these
cases must be a very small one. In ninetynine cases out of one hundred it would
be a very email amount which would bie
claimed, and this provision would cornpel
the man who wanted to dlaim a few dollars
to corne to Ottawa in order to get the pernission of the board to institute proceedings.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: Viotld not tîjis be
a fair criticism of 'that eectioxi? That last
paragraph wvas Tneant to prev'ent the wantoîî

can see tha-t it gshould flot be leftwide open
without the consent of the Iboard being Tequired, just as in so many actions the consent of the Attorney General is required.
The object of requiring- the board's cons6ent
is to see that there really is a prima facie
case.

Hon.

Mr. MACDONELL:

I bave a re-

quest from the Toronto Board of Trade witbl
reference to this section. I will just read
the request tlîey make:
This Is a provision giving power te 'brjng
action for infractions of ord'ers reepecting toilas
and providing for reoovery of three times the
arnount of the actual damnage which the person
complaining is Proved to have suffered,
It is
now provided in sribsection 2 that no action
shall be conmenced for the reoovery of such
daniages without leave of the Board being first
obtained.
Tire ierchants think that there is
no need of the complainant being put to tire expense of buth applying -te the Board for leave
and then to sue, and, they thlnk that the matter
might 4re lef t to -the Drdinary courts to deal
with without the neceseity of any preliminary
applioation to the Railway Board for leave to
proceed with the action.

It seems -to me tirat tHe principle in-"
voived in sub8eettion 2 is iundamientaIlb
wre ng. If we are going to authorize everv
commission or board of a public nature in
this country -to represent the Crown and
be satisfied before a claimant cao proce-ed
to sue, it is a serious niatter arnd one that
will lead, I think, to very great dissatic-

faction uitimately. The courts are in existence. Either they should be courts
whjch are free to ail men, or they should
be closed to ail men. It is right that the
Croin, for many reasons whicha 1 will ot
deal with at the moment, should have the

ri.gbt to deternîine whiether or flot the Kin '
shial be dragged into court and made tbe
defendant in an action; but tha t is, quite
a different miatter. Ail laywers know that

a fiat is pract-ically neyer refused te a sane
man acting- in a bona fide way. s0 that
even tire Kinig miay be proceeded ag-aiinst
in bis own court withi tIre utmost freedoiin

if tbere is any foundýation for a dlaim. 1
rbink- it is wrorng in principle to put a bar
across tbe door of the courts cif tis Domiiniioni, and reqttire the consent of any bodv
or an%- commission before a man cao enter
tbe Iribunal and asit for the King's justice.
.1t tire sanie timie, it occurs to mie tîrat
îirree tinies tbe amou-nt of the damag-es
is a pretty stiff penalty.
'Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The amiount of
thie damnages is always small.
Hon. Mr. '-NACDONELL: In any case
I tirink we sheirld not alhoýw this provision

to nove that.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But I have rnoved

Hon. Mr. POWER: I just wish to direct
attention -te the fact that there is something besides -tbe triiple damagaes. Section
390 begins:

So a cornpany may ha sued for penalties;then. if the person 'who feais bîmself parti-

cuiarly injured wishes, be can bring an action for triple dainages; but hie has first
to get'the leave ef the board. I tbink that
is a very reasonabie provision.
Hon. ?Mr. CIORAN: The clause is one
that should not ha toler-ated. in any British
comxnunîty. Nobody sbould be obligad to
go to an outside panty to get justice in the
King's courts.
Hon. - Mn. POWER: But the Railway
Board is not an. outsîde party.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: Nobody should be

Wby fýrce a

Columbia or from Prince Edward Island to
corne to Ottawa: to secure the right tço go
*to the Kings court 1-:r justice? The t 1 îing
i.- :ibEurd and ahouid r.,t ha tolerated. Ti!chonourable leader of the Governrnent is an
attorney of high standing in bis own province. Hçpw would be like any of his clients
who had suffered a paltry damage of $5 or
$10, and wbo is entitled under the iaw to
secure $30, to have to corne down to Ottawa
to make out his, case as be munst do before
he is efltitled te sue for three turnes the
arnount? The honourable leader of the Governrnent is advocating this clause; but if hae
*were out in bis own province, or in bis o*wn
city, and advocated that apart from bis
capacity- as leader o! the Governinent, the
people in bis own constituency would sunpiy say: "You are trying te block British
justice in this country." I would ask the
honourable leader of the Goverinent to
take into consideration the objections which
we put forth on behaîf of the great
public. That. is fair. 1 do not believe
that there is any danger that people
will take action for $25 or $50 danages for
no reason but simply to, bother the coinpany. To obviate the objections, the board
rnight be consulted as to the propriety of
taking an action of dýarages over a certain
amount, say, over $500, which-would make
worth while a trip to Ottawa to get permission from the board. A similar procedure
is followed in our Suprerne Court and Pnivy
Council case. 'A person cannot -take an
action to the Privy Counicil for less than
$2,000. His powers are limited to the courts
of Canada if ha has a dlaimi for $1,900, and
if ha loses it, ha bas no further repeal; but
if he bas a lam for $2,100 or $2,500 and it
is set aside by the Supreme Court, he bas
the right of appeal to the Privy Council.
Sometbing of the same kind can be put in
here to protect the rail'way company se that
persons 'wiil not take action for damages
useles,é4y or simply for the purpose of annoyance.- I do not believe that among the
nerchants there would the any who would
do that. If the principle governing our proOedlure ini regard to suprene court and
Privy Counicil cases were adopted, if the

16

SIENATE

same idea were in.troduced in this section,
that might cover the situation. We might
provide that no action of damages against a
railroad company should be take without
the consent of the board if such action is
for over $100, $200, or $500. 1 ar n ot particular about the amount that would be
fixed. Such a provision would flot antagonize the great mass of people whd have
business relations with the railway comnpany. By this clause as it stands ail the
peorer classes with smali actions of dam-.
agaes would be antagonized. If a man is
applying te, the board for leave to take act..n
of damages against a rail-way company fer
$500 or $1,000 it would not bc tee rnuch te
require him te get the permission of the
board. The bonourable leader of the Government says that ail a man has to do is
te write to the board, but we know what
that would mean; the letter wouid be
pigeon-holed. Is the Railway Board going
te grant permission te take action in court
simply on the strengath of a letter? And
would flot the company have a representiative corne down te Ottawa te protest ag-ainst
that consent 'being given? I tbink if this
clause cannot be amended it had better be
strickeu eut; bot if you want to give certain rights te the railway companry. the
way I indicate is, I think, the proper one.
It is already involved in our court procedure.
Tbe arnendn]ent ef Hon. Mr. Belcourt was
rregative: yeas, 6; nays, 12.
Section 390 was ag-reed te.
On section 193-other railways:

Hamilten we have the To-ronte, Hamilton and Buffalo railway running along Hunter street througb the centre of the city,
easterly and westerly, and an agitation bas
been g-oing on for rnany years te have that
railroad rnoved over te the Grand Trunk,
wbich is on the nortb side of the city, so ae
te have ail the railways corne in on the
tracks cf the Grand Trunk or some other
joint terminal. The matter has been up
before the Railwiay Board several times.
It bas been decided that the Railway Board
bas ne jurisdiction te require this diversien. A very elaberate report hae been,
made *by tbe most eminent engineers in
Canada as te ho-w tbis should be carried
eut. The railway companry lias speat a very
large arùiount of money on its tunnel and
its ether works, railway stations, etc., and
ne person ef any conscience eould ask that
the railway cornpanry make this diversion
at its own expense.

I thinkit is a very proper amend-ment if

Hon. Mr. THOMPSON: That is pretty

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: This is a very imsprung upon us suddenly, and I think we
should have time te consider it.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I certainly think se., too.
Ho-n. Mr. BOSTOCK: If -my honourable
friend e'ives that as -a notice, we wili consider it Pnother day.
Hon. W'. B. ROSS: It may be that we
niay xvaxt to enlarge or alter it, because
it deals 'with the important thing in the
world to-day. It is said that London, England, has 74 railway, stations, occupying
4,000 acres of land; that it takes 700 local
trains a day; and one question now b efore
the English Rail.way Board is to get legislation like this to enable the whole business
ta be done with three stations.
This
amendment is very far-reaching and very
important, and may turn out to be very
wise, but I would like to see it in print
and find how it would stand in relation
y
te other sections.
RHon. Mr. LYNOIH-STAUNTON: 1 quite
agree that it is a matter that should be
very carefully considered.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGREEJJ: This is
probably the largest proposition with which
we have had to deal -in the whole Bill,
and the mischievous principle underlying
it seems to be that in order f0 meet one
local situation it is proposed to pass general legislàtion s0 disturbîng in character
ac possibly to render useiess enormous expendifures which, have been made. I very
much doubt the propriety of giving authority to the Board in such a case as this,
to permit municipalîties or other bodies to
fhreaten the stability of any railway undertaking at any tîme when caprice or whimsicality may suggest that a change is desirable. It seems to me that in matters of
this kind stabîlity ià one of the fundamental elements or factors of every great
undertaking, otherwise we could not enter
upon an enterpri8e such as a great railway undertaking, involving cosfly terminais, when it would be within the power of
some municipal corporation to put the
Board in motion for the disturbance of
the whole enterprise.
Hon. Mr. LYNOH-STAUNTON: But the
honourable leader of the Government must
not forgef that by my proviso the expense
to be borne by -the railway company is flot
to be greater than the benefit they receive.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: In a case
of this kind would it not be better that it
should be deait with entirely upon its
merits, by legisiation introduced by the cify
of Hamilton or the parties interested?
Hon. Mr. THOMPSON: Yes.,

217

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Let- me
illustrate. In -a large and growing city,
residents in one section, which mighf ho
larger and more influential than another,
might think, that they could move the
board to miake a disturbing change in the
other part cf the city. It seems to me that
it would be injurious to make one section
subject to the operation of ail the mischievous elements and conflicting interests
in a great city. In such a case as my
honourable friend refera to I am satîsfied
that Parliament would give every consideration to a Bill to bring about sqjne specific
change, because they would be able te go
into all the facts, and ail information would
be available te assist Parliament to come
to a proper conclusion.
Hion. Mr. RICHARDSON: Where a municipality decides that a change would be of
advantage, they should be able to have it
made. In this country the custom of
having our railway stations together is
growing. Why should Hamilton have a
railway frack and station in the heart of
the city, bringing noise and dust, when the
track could be put down near the Grand
Trunk railway? Many other cities are
suffering in the same way, and I thifik this
is an excèllenf suibject f0 bring before this
House. The Railway Board would ascertain what advantage, if any, the change
would give the railway company, which
would not -be asked to contribut e any more
than the value cf 'the advantages they
would receive.

simply trifling with our national existence
as well as with our intelligence.
Hon. HFWIVTT BOSTOGK: Honourable
gentlemen, 1 have listened carefully to the
speech of the honourable leader of the Government introdu-cing this so-called Order in
Council te tbe Huse. H1e has told us, what
is very true, that the country is to-day faced
with a very grave and £erious situation, one
that we neyer expected Canada would be
faced 'with wben we -went into this war.
The situation is such a grave one that At
calîs for very energetic and prompt action
on the part of the Government, and I think
the whole people of this, country expect the
Government to-day to do its duty. But
while we are prepared to support the Government in everything that they think it la
right to do in order that the interests of
the people of Canada msy be safeguarded
and tbat we may do our duty as part o!
tbe British Empire, yet it is necessary for
us on tbis side of the House to point out to
the GoveTnment the irregularity of the step
tbey are taking in bringing this motion before Parliament as tbey are now doing.
Let me point out to bonourable gentlemen, first 6f ail, tbat tbis is a motion on
the Order Paper introduced into the Houe
o! Commons and into tbe Senate. at tbe
saine time. It bas not yet been passed by
the bouse o! Commons; I understand they
are stili discussing it, and tbey may amend
At. I do flot say tbat tbey will do so, but
according to my interpretation it is open to
an amendment, and it is witbin the right
of tbe Commons to amend il if tbey wish.
Until that motion comes before us from tbe
Commons we really do not know what it is,
therefore we can only discuss it as it stands
before us.
Now. what does this motion propose to
do? After reciting the urgent need of
reinforcenents, and that il is deemed
essential that, notwitbstanding exemptions
beretofore granted, a substantial. numnber of
men should be withdrawn fortbwitb from
civil life for tbe purpose 'o! serving in a

rmilitary capacity, and baving regard to the
number of men immediately required, and
wO
on, it goes on to say:
Therefore His Exceilency the Governor Generai in Council, on the recommendation of the
Ilight Honourable the Prime Minister. and under
and ini virtue of the powers conferred on the
Gavernar in Council by The War Measures Act.
1914, andi etherwiee, Je pleaeed ta niake the foliowing regulations3 which âhaU cSne into force as
soan as approved by resolutian of bath Houses
of Parliament, and the same are hereby made
andi enacted accordingly.

Ttien it goes on under thse head of
"«Regulations" to say:
1. In these regulatians,<s) "Minister" shahi mean the Minister of
Militia and Defence.
<b) "Act" shall mean the Military Service
Act, 1917.
2. Ciass 1 under the Act shall, In addition ta
the men Included therein as he saiti Art
mientlaned, include ail men wbo,(a) Are British subjects; and
(b) Are flot ivithin the classes of persans
described In the exceptions mentioned In
the schedule ta the Act; and
(c) Have attaineti the age af 19 years; but
were born on or since lSth October, 1897,
and
(di) Are unmarried or widoivers withaut
children; and
(e) Are resident in Canada.

Now, that is an amendment te the Miiitary Service Act, section 3, whieh says:
<1) The mnen who are liable to be calleti out'
shah! consist of six classes descrjbed as follows:
Class 1 Thosewho have attained the age of
twenty years and were born not earlier than the
year 183 andi are unmarried, ar are widawers
but have no chIld.

Therefore tbis motion proposes te amend
an Act o! Parliament. It is-stated that the
autbority for doing so is given under ýthe
War Measures Act; but, if bonaurable
gentlemen will look at that Act, tbey will
see tbat tbe War Measures Act, which was
passed by this Parliament in the second
session of 1914, says, infsection 3:
The provisions of sections 6. 10, il and 13 of
this Act shall only be in farce during war, invasion, ar insurrection, reai or apprehendeti.

Section 4 deals with the evidence of war;
section à relates to war existing since
August 4th; then section 6 states:
Thse Govemor in Counil. shall have power
to do and a4stherize eu.ch acts andi th-iag, andi
te make from time te tfrne such orders andi
reguhations, as hie may by reason of the existence of res.h or apprebendeti war, Invasion or
Insurrection desira neoese.ry or advisabl-e for
the secity,
defence, peace, order and welfare
of Canada; and for greater certainty, but nat
so as ta restriet thse generalhity of cthe foregxiing
ter'ms, it is hereby declared ljhat the powers of
thse Governor In Council shall extenti te ail
matters coeiing wit.hin the classes of subjects
hereinafter enumeratei, thet la to say:

?22

(a) oena-orship and, the control, and suppreeplans.
si00 of pusblications, writings, maps,

(b) arrest, detention, exclusion and deportation;
(c) control of the harbours, ports and territorial waters of Canada and the mnovemeuts

(d) transportation by land, air, or water and
the control of tihe transport of persons and
things ;
(e) itrading. expor'tation, Importation, produiction aud manuZaicture;

2. AU orders and regulations made under this
section sihaîl have the (tome of .law, and shall
be eniforced -in such manner and by such courts,
officers and authnoiities as 'the Governor in

thereunder, shall be affected therelby, nor ghall
any right, 4rivilege, obligation or liabiiity acqulred, accrued. accruin.g or incrurred thereunder

Honourable gentlemen, that ia the &ection
of the War Measures Act whem- tihe Govien-ment tihink t.hey get the power -to amend an
Act of Parliament by iesuing a reguliation.
There are in this House iawyera who have
more experience in the law than 1 have,
but I do flot think there is a single lawyer
in this House who can maintain ihat under
that section the Governmeni has the power
to amend an Act of Parliament.

so far as 1 know, those are the only powers

Now, thai Act wvas passed for the purpose
of making valid auy acts of the Governnment that it was necessary for tbem to

before Parliament assembled. It was rigbi
and proper, that, at that session of 1914,
when we were called dowu here when war

have been put ou the statute book to validate any action that the Government had

to do their duty by the people of Canada.
But that Act can have no effect at all on a
.statute that is passed through tbis Parlisment, and after ail those acts are doue at a

authority te, the Goverumeut to amend a
statute thai bas been carried through botb
the House of Commons and the Senate and

it can give ihem no authoriiy to amend an

My honourabie friend bas spoken tenigbht of the trouble and difficuliy thai the

here thai if tbe Government proceeda in tbis

oui these regulations ibey will find themselves Up againsi very much greaier difficuliies than they have experienced se far,

because I want te see tbemn carry out the

members called it the funeral-undertaking
departnient.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: One does not know
whether the Department of Justice lias bewen
consulted.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh. yes,
I can tell you it has.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: Did they give it an
Irish walce?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I can only point
out to this House that the situation of -Canada to-day is flot as difficuit or as strenuous
as the position in England; we find that
when the Prime Minister of England realized thie*seriousness of the situation, and
had to deal with the situation in Ireland
and introduce conscription there, he did not
proceed in the way the Government here
bas done with this nieasure, but hie brought
down a Bill before the British House of
Parlianient, and put it through ail its
stages, to provide for the extension ta Ireland af the conscription mneasure then in
force in England. I understand that the
British Governoment bas wider powers under its War M.\easures Act than we have in
Canada under our Act; and if the Imperial
Gavernnîent cauld find time, and thought it
desirable and neceszary, ta praceed by a
Bill for the purpose of extending the conscription nieasure of England ta Ireland,
I think that we could have found time also
in this Parlianuent of Canada ta deal with
a measure ixi a siimilar way.
I think that the Goverrnîent, lias made a
seriaus miistake iii this Inatter, and I would
urge upan thin, even at this tiime, ta withdraw this motion and deal %ith this matter
in the way iii which it shauld be dealt with,
by bringing in a Bill and aniending the
Act. in a praper îvay. I fear that the Geverniment have faund t:hat it is sa much
easier ta pass Orders i Counceil that tJiey
wisli ta do awav wit-h Parhaiaent altogether.
Away back an Decenîber 3, 1917, they passed
an Order iii Caunicil which reads as follows:
His Exccllency the Governar Generi in Council, on the recommendation of the Right H-onourable Sir Rlobert Laird Borden, the Prime Minister. and under and in virtue of the provisions
of the Military Service Act, Is pleased 10 order
and il la hereby ordered that in any case w'here
a person engaged in agriculture has appiied for

exemption and such exemption has been refused, the Minister of Militia and Defence, if he
la of the opinion that the services of such per-

son are essential

for promoting agricultural

production, may, by order under his hand, discharge such pereon fromn Military Service.

Tfhat was an Order, in Gauncil dealing
with the question of exemptions under the
Military Service Act.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: Th-at is bow they
carried te Nortb'we6t.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: This w-as passed at
Ottawa before the electio.:, and, 'it went forth
ta the people befoTe the election as a statement ithat the Government was prepared
to exempt men for agricultural purposs
from one end of the country to te other.
Themn a further Order in Council 'was passed
on tihe seule date, which reais as follo'we:
Elie Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation at the Acting Minister of Agriculture, and under and in virtue of
the provisions of the War Measures Act, 1914.
and the Mllltary Service Act, 1917 is pleased
to authorize and doth herebv authorize the Minister of Agriculture to appoint a representative
of the Department of Agriculture in sucli countties or districts in any province of Canada as
he may determine;
1. To attend the sittings of thé tribunals appointed under the Military Service Act, ta guard
the national interests in connection with the
production of foodstufis;
2. To appeal from the decision of the tribunais In any case wliere, In his opinion, the tribunal bas not given due weight to the urgency

ot maintaining our food supplies;

3. To investigate and report upon appeals or
applications for exemption where the ground of
appeal or application Is that the party aszlrig
exemption should in the national inlerest bý
retained in food production rather than enrolled
in the expeditionary for-ce.

Hon. Mr. CLORAN: Whiat is the date of
that Order in Council?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK. That is, also d.ated
the 3rd of December, 1917.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: Killing their own

that it was important in the intereats af th-e

from the Minister of Agriculture, statlng that
by Order of the Military Authorities, Leave of
Absence Boards have been - ooritituted for
each Mllitary District for the purpose of dealing with applications for leave of absence of
personis orde'ed to report for duty under the
Military Service Act, 1917, and
That the view of the growing necessity of
maintaining and increasing the food production
of the cou ntry, 't is necessary te give special
attention to applications made on behaif of
farmers and farm labourers for such leave, and
te that end il is expedient that an agricultural
representative be appointed for each Milltary
District te act as adviser te the Board in cases
in whichi agricultural interests are involved.
The Minister, therefore, recommends that he

Th&t shows that a4t that time the Geverninent considered that the production of

far as to aay that in the ýcarrying on of

that if tho civilian population of France

representation, made through this Act they

Hon. L\r. PLANTA: Just a moment ago
my honourable friend esaid they were
Liberals.
Hon. '.%r. CLORAN: Yes, they were; but
the Governinent was preaching two doctrines. First they said: "Farmers shall be
allowed to remain on the land ta produce
food for the troops." Then the Government
preached another doctrine. Tbey said that
more men wvere needed -M~r the Iront. Iii
spîte of the declarations of the Governiment,
the Siftonian policy was 'ta go ta every
farmer and tell him that hie would not be
exem.pt-ed unless hie voted for Union Govern-,
ment. The farmers becam-e fri.ghtenied and
consented te vote for tlie Union candidate
on the ground that they would be exempted.
This is true not only of the West. Why,
my good friend General McLean-he used
ta be Colonel M.\cLean-in St. John, sent
out a circular signed by himself, ta the
farmers in New Brunswick, especially in
hiýs own. constituency-I have the doicuments in niv office-stating that men who
would vote for imii could go ta the courts
and get exemption thraugh his partner, a
lawyer. That is how the Union Governnient forced their way into powerby deception, hv fraud, by threat. They
did it flot only' on thie plains of the
North-west.
1 amn sorry te say that
they did it iii the trenches. in the baspitalN, in the harracks, and in tîLe camips,

Parliament passed no farther back than

honouraible leader of the Opposition when
he says tb'at the Government should bring
down a Bill. They sbould have the courage
and the manhood to propose a Bill, Ro that
the people may underetand it and Parliament rnay act according to British constitutional lawv. We are not opposed to lilling
up the trenches with *our sons. I for one
arn not. No farther back than ]ast week,

to be bulldozed hy a Government. I -do
not want to be seized and throttled by any
Governrnent. My loyalty je ini my heart,
in rny mind, and in the blood of rny family.
Loyalty is in the blood of ail wbo feel as I
do. The Goverument have no rigbt to
corne before the country with false and
deceptive legisiation and do what tbey are
now doing. These are the points, and I
hold that the honourable leader of the
Opposition bas taken a proper attitude in
protesting against the manipulation of the
British constitution by the Government.
Let the Government corne down rnanfully
and ask to have their Military Service Act
am-ended. Ie it because tbey are ashamed
of their previoue legislation t.hat they are
Irving now to hoodwink the public? They
have promised under the Military Service
Act and through their Orders in Council
that no farmers, no farmers' sons, no
farmiers' needed aid, in the form of
labourers or otherwise, should be conseripted. That has been their declared
policy Up to the present, and nou', under
thle guise of an Order in Council, tbey
corne and sa\': "All that .we promised, al
ilhat wve pledged ourselves to do, to secure
power, we cast it -acýide." By one feil blow
they take away frorn tbe people their
zacred rig-hts. That is the condition of
things. Is that an bonour to Canada? la
that creditable to our statesnianship? Is it
not worse thian kaizserisinf So, honourable
gentlemen, we are followîng a path that
leads neither to honour nor to usefuines
on behialf of the poor boys who are dying
in the trenches. This is flot the way to
serve thoni. This is not the way to keep
the honour of our country aloof frorn deception, Io keep our Government aloof
frorn securing power tbrougb fraud. '%Vhat

things wbicb dernand the attention of this

not all of the tirne, and the Liberals
tbrougbout the country wbo in the last

through false pretenees will at tbe firet
opportunity caet the vote that will drive
the Government from power. Tbe Government under the pret-ense that they want to
save tbe boys at tbe front, claiming that
tbey bave autbority under a War Measures
Act wbicb limite their power, are oversteppîng their po'wers every aay in the week
and -every week in the montb. Government to-day je no longer by Parliarnent;

point of vie-w, je the condition of tbings

now, by another Order in Council thet je

Parliament je to ho ebolished. It je put
into the banda cd whorn? Into tbe bande of
a censor, or a Speaker. Why, in the naern
of the British constitution, has the voice
of Parliarnent to be re-ecboed hy a servant
of the Crown or of ParliameTt? That is 110w
on the tapie. Parliament je no longer to be
free, rio longer to have the right to criticise
ill-doing, no longer the right to suggest
wise action to the Governrnont, end all our
freedom of speech jes to be put into tbe
hands of one man, the censor or the Speaker. le noV that an overt.hrow of everything
that England hias fought for during the peet

These are crimes again-st constitutional liberty under the British regirne, and we in

PRINCE EDWARD IUSIAND RECRUITING.
Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. JOHN MeLEAN: 1 would like to
bring to t.he notice of this honourable House
a matter with reference to a dlaim for separation allowance. There vas iu Prince
Edward Isiand a dootor by the naine oi
Gillis, who died and .let a family of ithree
sons and two daughters. The family ruoved
to Winnipeg 'where two of the sons enlisted, leaving t.wo daughters there. The
cilher son veut to the United States about
six years ago and has not been hesard of
since. The tiwo sons went to the front. One
of themn was killed and the other severely
wounded. One of the sioters is in the
hospital, au invalid, sud the whole expense
of supporting her falis upon the eister who
is now living iu Winnipeg aud earn.ing her
own living. I have a letter f-rom a uephew
of muine who saw her a short time ago, sud
I have also a letter from herseif. I do not
think At is necessary to read ail the letter
fromn my nephew but I will read enough to
enable the House to understanid. It says:
1 wrote you last year about this matter, but
neyer reoeived any reVply.
Since then lier
brother bas been kiiled. in action, and it bas left
her In a bad position, as she Is the soie support
of her sister Fiorrie, who Is an invaild in the
States.
Twvo of lier brothers went to the wnr, airnost
at the istart. one bas been badly woufl(ed, and
the Dther killed.
She bas a third brother, about whoni she
speaks of in her letter, and ahe cannot locate
him. and dos flot know if he is stili living or
flot.
It appears that ber brother Clarrie, who was
killed, failed to talce out a Separation allowance, and after he enilsted seems that be could
not get it through, and bad to proceed Overseas
without havin« the matter fixed up.
HIe then assigned half of bis pay to bis sister.

Another case has happeued lu Prince Edward Island te which I would caîl atten-

tion. In the Lall of 1916 a call was made
teo Prince Edward Island to furnish 100 men
for art.llery and others for infantry .and lor
the navy. My son, who had qualified as
lieutenant, and a young man by the naîne
of -Davidson,1 -of Chiarlottetown, aiso a lieutenant, vent through the country recruiting, and I, along with a good many o.thers,
assisted, asking for volunteers for ithe
artillery, 'aiso Ifor 'the inlautry, and
foS
the navy.
In cur section we
secured thirty-two men for the artiillry,
18 for the infan'try, and 14 for the navy.
Those mnen vent aeros to England. There
were in the party 84 men from différent
sections of Prince Edward Island. I do flot
know exactly how many of them *were for
the infantry, but there were quite a number
for the navy. Imrnediateiy on their arrivai
at Liverpool they were ail put into the infantry. Upon the iieutenant's claiming that
the men were eniisted for the artiiiery 'they
were tu>ld that they couid eithe-r go into the
infantry or go back to Canada. However,
the men 'were ail separated-from each other.
This situation continued for two or three
montha. I wrote then to ;Sir George Periey,
calling his attention to the matter, and
stating that the parents of those young men
who had enieted for the artiilery were finding very great fault because some of them
had been -cent over to France as infantrymen within tliree months of their arrivalin
England, though they had enlisted as artilleryrnen. The answer that I received waa
that in the càbiegram that had corne across
asking for 500l men fromn Can-ada for artillery, the figures had been changed *by the
telegraph comipany to 5,000, and it was
found wben ail arrived in Eng-land that
there were more men for the artiliery than
there were guns available. Sir George Perley nientioned that after making inquiry hie
had iearned that ail of those men stili in
Engiand were being put into the -artiilery
and the rest would be put into the artîllery
as soon as they were located; they had been
sent over to France and w.ere ail divided
up. As honourable gentlemen will understand, the parents of those young men w'ho
were sent over feit very indignant. Eventuaily two of those mien who vent over to
France as infantrymen were kiiled at the
same time aud another was gassed. I want
to caUi special attention to the case of a
youug man by the n.aine of Campbell, who
was kiiled. His father is paralyzed and
totaiiy heipiess. They have a arnali farmn

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Are there many
of these lands abandoned as the resuit of
men going to the front? Is that one of the
reasons for this ActP
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Those
men are protected. In fact, service at the
front counts as reeidence.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: I understand that
the hlomestead inspector has to> make a
valuation of the improvements. Prevdiously,
the person who app4ied for canoellation
made the valuation. It seerns te, me that
this Bill le taking powers out of the istatute
and putting them into, the hands -o! the
minister. I do not object te that at ail. As
a mnatter of fact, I think the late Mi.nister
oi the Interior was a ]ittle too anxious to
have everything crystallized into a statute.
1 think that -the department can be better
administered by regulations well applied.
1 should like to aek what amount is outetanding on seed grain relief and aeed and
feed.
Hon. Sir, JAMES LOUGHEED: I amn
sorry that I cannot give my honourable
friend the information. I understand that
it is a small amount compared with what
was advanced.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: What w-as the total
amount advanced?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEE.D: I think
itwas $13,OOO,OOO.
Hon. Mr. WATSON < It would be intereeting to get that information, and I would
ask the mini6ter to make a note o!' it and
bringý it down on the third reading.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yee.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Paragraph c seems
to work a*hardship on a mnan. What was
the reaszon for the Government dealing wîth
the matter in that way? Why s.hould he
have to pay for the seed supplied to a former man?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Re had
the advantage of the seed.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOOK: Not the man who
is taking it over?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: He need
flot take it over unless he is prepared to
psy for that. It is simply a charge ag-ainst
the land, like a mortgage.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: I think in many
cases the seed supplied- was of more value
than the land. 0f course, this only applies
to the case of a man who wîshes to take
up the land. He does flot have to take it

Hon. Mr. WATSON: In addition to what

to know how many homesteads 'that received seed grain were abandoned.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I will get
that information..
Section 1 was agreed to.
Sections 2, 3 and 4 were sgreed to.
On section 5-Absent on military or
naval service, and for three months after
discharge, to be counted as residenice:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: What is the alteration in these two clauses?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This provision will exctend to -the members, of our
Allied forces.
Section 5 was agreed to.
Orý section 6-Issue of letters patent to

Hon. Mr. POWER. Clause 3 seems to be
rather sweeping. I should like te ask the
honourable -leader of the Governxnent if it
does or does flot involve a change in the
existing law?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED. No. That,
I understand, is the old Act.
Hon. Mr. -BOSTOCK: Has the minister
got the old Act before him? If he has, I
think he will see that there is a change in
sub-section 3 after the word "Act."
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, yes.
My honourable friend from Halifax (Hon.
Mr. Power) refers only to subsection 3 ?
Hon. Mr. POW.ER: Yes.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Subsections (c), (d) and (e) are new.
Hon. Mr. POWER: Do I understand that
in the law as it is now an alien who bas
not been naturalized cannot zet letters
patent-for a hornestead?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That has
been the law. I will just read the old Act.
It says:
Letters patent -for a bornestead shal flot issue

that, on compx1etion of the requirements for the

Han. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: An alien

who has gone te Europe to fight for an
enemy country cauld nat get a patent without taking the oath*that he had not fought
with the enemy's forces.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: There is nothing
in this Act to show that.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Sulb-elause a covers

Hon. Sir JAMES LOU&HEED: I have

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: What price does

Hon. Sir JAM'%ES LOUGHEED: Under

On section 12-sale of agricultural lands

Hon. Sýr JA'MES LOUGHEED: The old
section 32 applies to ag-ricultural lands purchased under regulatione muade by the Gov.
ernor ln Council. It le not necessarily confined Io homnesteads.
Hon. '-\r. WATSON: The minister would
not have authority to allow land to be sold
for $1 an acre that was purchased for $3
an acre as homuestead land.
Hon. 'Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That
would not apply to a pre-eruption. It only

applies to a homestead. which a man earns
by residence and duties.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: It seems t0 me thaf
this might be interpreted f0 allow the minister to reduoe the price froru $3 fo $1.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, because under no provision of the statute bas
hie the right to sell a homestead. The Governor in Council could do this at -thepresent
time; but it is now proposed that the minister rather than the Governor in Councîl
should exercise that right, as hie je the on]y

Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: This gives another nian an opportunity of getting that

On section 17- ithdrawal of portion of

Hon. Mr. GORDON: It eeems to me that
sixty days' notice of withdrawal of a portion o! a timfber [berth .by the minister is
not eufficient. The notice mig.ht come at a
time -when the license holder %va.s not abile
to take off the timber that waô on it. At
one season of the year it might be ahl righit,
but at another season it might flot.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This iS

Hon. Mr. GORDON: 1 6uggest that the
notice of withdrawal should be ninety days
instead of six-dy da"s.
Hion. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If the
case required an extension of time, surely
thie niiiiister would grant it. We will miake
it ii:iety days.

Hon. Mr. WATSON: It seenis to nie that
tis section puts in the ha.nds o! the minister a pood doal of patronage. If a man holds
a tiniber berth, and there is any part o! the
area which lie does not wish to retain, hie
cail iinake application to the minister, who
ivill ztrike it out of his berth, and thus
relieve hirn fromn paying ground rent on it.

to provont iorest fires-that they have to
pav a certain amount on the ares of the

conditioni of holding the berth. Imnder this

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Certaiinly
the officiais who deal with these matters
have as much knowledge as a lumberman.
Why should an area be tied Up for ail time
under a license, when a large part of it
niight flot have a sufficient quantity of
timber for use?
Hon. 'Mr. EDWARDS: In the old Act
there is a provision for withdrawal of the
license in case the land is fit for cultivatdon.
If this country is anaking one mistakze
grester than another, it is the depietion -of

is quite as important to, Canada as the retaining of its lands.

with the hi.nourable gentleman on the importance of iliaintaining forest reserves; but in
northern M1anitoba and Saskatchiewan there
are niany places where a timber berth has
been granîted to soine miii man, and a town
has be-en built ýnear it; and, slthough the
nierchantable timber had been cut off and
the berth practically depleted, the very fact
that the people could not acquire any of
the land for the purposes of cultivation, has
held back the whole district. I think this
is -a vers- ;ise clause. I differ wvith some
honourable gentlemen. 1 think the Minister

APRIL 22, 191825
of the Interior ought ta have some discretionary powers in this matter; I think
the 'trouble during the last ten or flfteen
years bas been that he bas had too littie
power in dealing with matters of t.his kind.
I agree with my honourable friend fromn
Rideau (Hon. Mr. Edwards) as ta taimber
areas in Ontario. Is the Goverinment going
te tiake a piece of tirnber land ta build a
town or for hoenesteading if the timber is
not ail taken off P I do not think any
mirniter of the Crown 'would be guilty of
doing that. Leave iA ta the discretion of
the minister.
.Hon. Mr. EDWARDS: There are conditions and conditions, and 1 say at once
that q do not know the conditions in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta; but, s0
far as the eastern portion of this coountry
ie concernied, this provision wouid be a
very seriaus mfistake.
.Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: For a
great rnany years this hasa been the practice
of the depaftment. Where an area has
been deniuded of timber, or bas an insufficient supply of timber ta warrant its being
continued under license, the Government
rg1ieves the licensee of it, and it reverts
ta the public domain, te be used for any
purpose that may be considered 'wise.
lion. Mr. GORDON: But if the hicensee
does niot want ta relinquish it? He may
think it is valuâble and be willing ta pay
the ground rent upon it, yet 'the minister
says, «'It is not valuable, and you mnuet
release it."
Hon. *Sir JAMES LOUGIIEED: There
is no reason 'why an-y person should play
the dog- in the manger. If there is no comnmercial timber upon the l'and, there is no
reason why he ehould tie it up for ail
zrne.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Sometimes there ie
a dîfference of opinion as ta whether there
is commercial timber upon the territory or
neot.
Hon. Mr. WATSOfN: I think that as
much as possïble the reeponsibility of protecting the timber that rernains on the tireber berth and is valuable for commercial
purposes oaght te be leit ta the man who
holds the license. The aid Act, which this
is wiping out, provides:
When any poartion of a tituber berth has nat
upan it tiniber in sufficient quantlty ta make

it commerciaaly

vaiuable

of

the

kind

and

dimensions descrIbed in the license, the Minister
may declare that portion lit for settlement and
wîthdraw It £rom, the -berth.

But the provision now being made is that
the minister may withdTaw any portion of a
timber berth -which he thinks fit for settierient. 1 understand- that at the 'present
turne the holders are under obligation ta provide a certain portion of the cost of forest
-rangers for protecting the 'timbeir from fixe.
The area is v8lcable not &i:nply becauso
tituber fit for saw-miil purposes, or for
Fawing, is taken off it. I know timber reatives in the West, for instance the Riding
'lountain reserve. which have not inuch
tituber fit for sawrniil purposes. but which
aie important for the purposes of fire proti ction. Attempt', have oe,,zr zn:de ta reduce the Riding Mountain timiber reserve
fur the purpose. of .providing soine homesteads along t-he edge of the rese'rve; but
*,he Governinent hau maintainpâ the policy
timat that reserve is worth as mnach or more
than the farm lands adjoining, becausp,,
as honourable gentlemen who are familiar
with the West know, if a fire we-e alluwed
te get into sucli a reserve and denud,, .ît of
timber, the snow would meit more rapidiv
and the Âssiniboia river would be dried up
ir' the summer time. We have ta protect
those reserves- for the purpose of rainf ails
or moisture, and in an agricuiturai country
iL is just as important ta have the land reserved for tha't particular purpose as to.
have it cuitivated.
Now, according ta this provision, a persan
who has a 25-mile timber berth and bas
10 miles of it skinned off and says, -I wart
ta throw this out," can be reiieved of payinghis, share of the annuai dues for forestranging for the purpose of keeping fire out
of the'district. That scrub land may bc
just as valuabie, on account of the effect
on rainfail, as if it contained timber that
was fit for saw-niill purposes. The amatitimber growing up on those timber berthe is
of great value ta the country and ought tu
be protected. and the man who leases th'it
timber berth and bas good merchantabte
timber on it ought ta be taxed for tho purpose ôf heiping ta keep fire out. By thiclaupe you are enablîng the mini&ter ta re
lieve the holder of a license entireiy ç-f
those responsibilities which he bas at the
present time.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I should imagine
that 'this clause is a protection for the lumberman.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: I think se too.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL. It looks like that.
At the sarne tirne, if there is any difference
of opinion such as that mentioned by the
honourable g-entleman fram Nipissing (Hon.

SENATE

236

Mr. Gordon) it can be arranged. The legal
represen'tative of the lumberman can appear before the minister and argue bis case,
if hie thinks that the timber limit is wortb
holding.
Hon. à1r. WATSON: The honourable
leader of the Government can informi us if
my idea of the present law is flot correct
that the owners of timber berths are required to pay a portion of the forest-ranging
expense.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOU<GHEED: Yes, but
the Government administers the fire-protection regulations 'regarding those forest
reserves.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: But the licenseholder has to psy.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: And the
owner provides bis share. The withdrawal
of a certain ares frorm a timber berth would
flot in any way affect the enforcement of lire
regulations. The regulations continue.
Hon.. Mr. WATSON: Yes, but the person
who bolds the timber berthHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: He may
be relieved of the payment of bis share.
Hon. Mr. WATSON. Yes.
Hon. 'Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But there
is no reason why he should continue for
longer than the period of the license.
Hion. Mr. WATSON: 1 thin.k that for no
excuse should the forest reserves in Manitoba or in Saskatchewan be reduced-for
cultivation or for any other purpose. 1 believe those lands oug-ht to be maintained
for ail time, for the reason which 1 have
jus't given. I believe they are more valuable for the purpose of conserving inoisture
than for agriculture. The accumulation of
snow which preserves the moisture for the
streams in the summer time is greater than
it would be if the land were under cultivation. In many cases only a small portion
is cultivsted. 1 remember that in the Red
Mountain reserve some years ago a fire
started on Gilbert plains and burned right
across to Rossburn, a stretch of country
about thirty by sixty miles. That damage
will never be fully repaired. A lot of valuable timber was burned. A great deal of
the landl burned over is un-fit for honiesteading. We lose in every case of fire.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: I would like to
emphasize what I said a moment ago about
the desirability of allowing the minister to
have discretionary powers regarding this
H-on.

Mr. DANIEL.

matter. My honourable friend. froin Portage
la Prairie <Hon. M. Watson) may remember
very well the case at Lac du Bonnet. A lumberman some years ago secured a large area.
including a whole town site ,and taking
in land north and south along the Winnipeg
river. After a while that town grew to be
a fairly large place. A great many settlers
came in and settled along the river, near
where the land had been taken. up, and
a great many imore settlers fromn the
province o-f Quebec camne in, looking for
land along the river. and could not get
any, The timber had been cut o>ff for
miles around this t0wn. The itfinher berth
had been practically denuded of ail merchantable timber, though there was a lot of
cordwood on it. Time after time 1 myself
appealed to the Go'vernment to have -this
land thrown open for settlement. There
were dozens and dozens of inei inaking
applications for that land. It was good
land, splendid for agriculture. Something
was done: eome of.-the land was released.
But I hold that this clause in the Bill is
absolutely necessary. The minister ought to
have discretionary powers in cases of this
kind to say to a lumberinan:- "You canino.t h-old. up this whole district; men are
coming fromi On.tario and Quebec, wanting
&orne of thie land for fa.rms ato put their
families on, norw that you have eut off al
the timber that is worth anytbing." The
minisster ought to be able to deal with a
maitter of this kind. 1 do not doubt that
my honourable friend from Portage la
Prairie (Hon. Mr. Watsop) bas bad a similar experience in other parts of the province. 1 cani understand-that what he says
about Riding mountain and other reserves
is absolutely true; but it is not the intention o! the Governimenit, 1 am sure, to int.erfere with those timber reserves.
Hion. Mr. TODD: In the province of New
Brunswick cases somewhat similar to this
have occurred with Tegard to Crown l.ands,
as between the license-bolder a.nd the Government, the Governnient claiming that the
land, being depleted. o! &ts.tiniber, should
be given out in free granits for setitlenient.
The arrangement generally made there was
to give the license-holder, -when be claimed
there was timber on the la.nd, sufficient
time to take the -timber off, and after that
time to give eut the land in free grants.
Why could net 6omething of that nature
be done in this case?
Hon. Mr. ýGORDON: That is just what is
wrong with this clause. A person is granted
a license without being given any specific

APRIL 22, 1918
time in which to take off the timber; then
this paternal legislition is introduced,
w.hereby 'the tninister inay corne along and
say, "You have deple.ted the timber of -this
10-mile area, and we take it from you hecause we want àt for agricultural purpose-s,"
even though it imrnediately adjoins an area
on which there is a large quantity of ttimber. The farmers corne in there and your
tîmber is destroyed. That bas been the
case in Ontario and Quebec, and it will be
the case in the West if such clauses as this
are enacted. WVhy not, when selling #his
timber, grant a license for five or eight or
ten years? The licensee 'will then know
he has to take off timber in that Urne and
he gats it off.
Hon. Mr. TODD: I do not .think it would
be satisfactory to the license-holder tio
have hie licensef limited as to time. He may
want to put a mill and other equipment oi
the land, and would require a permanent
license. Would flot an addition to this
clause giving the license-holder a certain
time to take the timber off at the request
of the minister proteet -the license-holder,
and at the same time prevent -the land frorn
heing tied Up? If the ti.mber were worth
taking off, the license-holder would then
take it off, or, if he did not, he could find
no faul.t.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: In the
first place, we deal only with land on which
there ie practically no timber; in, the second
place, we allow 60 days under the amendment-and I arn willing now to eirtend the
peTiod ;to 90 days-in which to take off
what littie timber remains. In that way,
I think the situation would be fuUly met.
Hon. Mr. TODD: That was exa.ctly the
ground taken in New Brunswick in every
case-that there wvas no tirnber on the land.
Though that -,as the viewNpoint of the
Governinent, the license-holder generally
clairned there %vastimber. 0f cour-se, 60 or
even 90 days, is a short tinie in which to
take timber off.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: I thi.nk that honourable gen.tlemen are looking at this question
frorn different view-points. I ar n ot objecting to this clause from the standpoint
of the lumberman. The principal reason
for withdr-awing, the land 'from the timber
berth is flot that it is agricultural Uand
which is wanted for farming purposes. I
arn inclined to think tihat the application
for this clause cornes from the men holding
timber .be'rths in the West, who want to be
relieved of a good deal of mileage they are

holding at the present time, and on which
they have to pay their annual dues.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We always
did relieve them; that bas been the practice
for vears and years.
Honý. Mr. WATSON: What bas been?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: To relieve thern of any part of the biruit which
had been depleted o4f timber, or 'which it
w-as not desirable to hold.
Hon. 1fr. WATSON: I think that the man
who holds a timber berth and wants stili
to retain a portion of it for the purpose of
getting valuable timber off it. ought to be
taxed for the purpose of keeping fire out
and protecting it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: He is.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Under this sect.ion
the minister rnay relieve him.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But the
fire protection systern goes on alI the saine;
it is mainitained by the Gyovernment.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: But the mnan who
holds the timber berth is not taxed for part
Of it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: He is
just relieved of the rent of that portion.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: The section in t.he
old Act appeals to me as much better. It
provided for cases where land was Tequired
as fit for agricultural purposes. I venture
to sav that under this section there will be
a great number of square miles of timber
berths taken out of the 'present leases and
le.ft with no person to look after them.
Sub.section 1 of section 17 was agreed Vo.
On subsection 2 of section 17-reduction
of rent:
Hon. Mr. POWER: I.Voccurs to nie that
this subsection is susceptible of arnendment:
(2) Upon the withdrawal o! fl yPortion of a
tiniiber berth. the renta1 to be paid under the
license shall be reduoed in proportionx to the
aîea withdraw'n.

A inan secures a tîxnber -berth of 25 square
miles. He is suppoaed Vo know what the
land is like when he applies for it. He
gets these 25 miles- and after a little while
it appears that 15 square miles of the 25
are comparatively valuelees-there is very
little timber and the bulk of it may be rock.
The Governnîent under the Act have power
to reduce the amount that he has to pay
- in pro-portion to the area withdrawn."

SENATE
My criticiSmn is on these last words, because
the 10 miles which he retains may be geed
timber land, and the remaining 15 square
miles may be alniost valueless for tixnber
purpases. I think tlîat. instead of saying
"in proportion te the ares withidrawn,"
we should say, «"in proportion to the value
ol the area -withdrawn." I think that is an
amendment that would commend itself ta
the 'minicter's good sense.

navigable rivers for -the purpose of carrying
out such public works as harve been authorized by the Federal Government from time
Vo time. No direct legisiation has been
passed upon the subi ect expressing what
the au.thori.ty.of the minister may be as to
making eueh entry, and it is therefo-re
thought desirable 4o bave Vhs expressed ini
direct language, so that the Federal Goverument rnay exercise the neoesgary authority which is inoidentai to the carryiug out
of such works, in being permitted to go
upon the bed of any navigable river flotwithstanding any dlaim 'which snay be set
up as to its being vested in -the province.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I should like to ask
the honourable minister il there is any provision i another portion of the Act for
paying compensation, to the parties wh.ose
property may be seriously damaged by the
exercise of the powers provided for in this
section.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I cannot
conceive of any damage arising in such a
case. It is purely -a technical right.
Hon. Mr. POWER: Weil, I can.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: In whait
way might damage -arise? The department
is flot going int possession cf the navigable water; they are simply en.tering on iV
for the purpose of carrying on works. In
the first place. the Government 'would have
a righit to enter upon s navigable water for
the purpose of carrying out public works,
but a technical question might arise as Vo
whether a trespass -were being coramitted
in their so doing. If my honourable friend
has in view any damage that would arise
from such course, I should very mnuch like
to know IL.
Hon. Mr. EDWARDS: I suppose the general idea is that so faxr as -the Dominion
Governuient is concerned it is only a questien of transportation; it bas no right Vo,

honourable gentleman bas disclosed here
are very des'irable, I think that it is quite
unnecesary that a new department should
be created for the purpose of attending to
them. IV could he donie just as well in the
Militia Department, where there are plenty
of men who could perform these duties,
without creating a new department with al
its staff. I mentioned the ether day that
in the United States, 'where they have a
population of over a hundred. millions, and
a country which, taking its habitable surface, is as large as Canada, they have only
ten meashers of the Cabinet aIl told. Here
we have now over twenty. I think that
when one of the mem bers of this Government has been emphasizing lately the desirability o! individual members of the community exercising the greateat economy. we
mîght -expect somnething different from this
wholesale creation of nlew departments.
Hon. ilr. McLENNAN: Without Vouching the latter part of tihe question which
the honourable Senator from Halifax (Hon.
Mr. Power) 'brought up, namnely, the multiplication of departments, iV seeme to me
there is a very distinct adivantage in having
this work separated from the Militia Departmnent. I speak as one who bas had
'the pleasure of assisting the honourable
leader of this Hous iu Vh.is work since its
inception. Essentially the work of the 'Militia Department is Vo take a citizen and
turn him into a soldier. The work of this
department,.which embraces the operations
of the Invalid Soldiers' Commission and of
the Pensions Board, is Vo, Vake a man who
lias be-en a -soldier emporarily in defence
o! his -country, acting from the highest motives, and turn hima back into a civilian,

given him Vo make a good citizen of him.
IV seems Vo me, and I think iV would seem
Vo the honourable gentleman on reflection,
that military influences are noV the best

therefore the separation of it fromn the Militia Department is a vqry desirable thing.

APRIL 22, 1918
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The
question of navigable waters has been
establisqhed over and over again by the
Privy Council. Those waters are vested in
the Crown through the Federal Government. The Public Works Act gives pýower
to th;e Miniater of Publie Works Io have
"the management, charge and direction of
the following properties 'belonging to Canada, and of the services in, this section
enumerated, namely, dams, sawmill works,
construction, repairs of harbours, powers
and works for improving navigation on
any property, and the veeeels, dredges, etc.,
slides, dams, piers, booms for worlcsz,". etc.
So that there- is no question as to the
navigable waters being vested in the Crown
through the Federal Governnent; and it is
ancillary to the exercise of that power that
the Federal Government has the necessary
authority to enter upon the bed of a naiigable stream, althoLlgh that bed nlay be
vested in the province. Otherwise it is
quite manifest th-at the power vested in the
Federal Government could not be exercised
at afli.
Hon. '-%r. POWER: I do not object te
the Federal Government using the power,
but I do object.to their taking the property
of people without compensation.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There is
abundant provision made in our statute for
compensation to which any persan may be
leg-ally entitled.
Hon. 'Mr. POWER:
te knoiv.

That is what I want

Hon. Sir JA'MES LOUGHEED: The Bill
only gives authority to officers or -ervants
of HiS M\ajestv or contractors for the work
'to enter upon. dig up. dredge and remove
any part of the bed cf siich navigable wvater,
or to builti or erect any %werkstherton, as
may be directed or authorized b' the
Governor in Council or biv the minizter for
the improvernent cf the navig-ationi.* The
whole qiuestion turns upon that of navigation. If the streani is not a navigable one,
then it is nianifest that the power cannet
be exercised. If it is a navigable stream,
then that power is vested in the Crown, as
I have said, through the Federal Government, and the Government may have powers
that are ancillary te the proper exercise of
that power.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: But nearly every
stream would be a navigable streamn, and it
se-ems to me that there would be great
danger of the Federal Government, in the
S-161

exercise of this power, infringing on the
rights of the provinces.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: Do you net think the
'word "navig-able" there means tidal?
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: If it means onily
*tidal waters, that is another matter; -but
we have no authority for taking that view
of the definition of the word "navigable."
Hon. Mr. ROSS: I have neyer examined,
the question for the purpose of arriving at
a concluision, but my impression has been
that the Dominion -Parliament controls
matters relating to tidal waters. I do net
know that the Dominion Parliament bas
power te interfere with fresh water streama
or inland lakes. 1 would like te look up
that question.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Would net the fact
that ne one can build a wharf to interfere
with navigation de away with the objection
of the honourable gentleman from Halifax
(Hon. Mr. Power)? It appears te me that
the law already denies the right te any one,
whether lrom a provincial government or
otherwise, te bud any pier or make any
obstruction that would in any way interfere
with the navigation of a navigable stream,
unless-at ail events--he bas the permissien and authority of the Federal Government. Se, if ne one is allowed te interfere
with the navigability of a river, I do net
see how anv one could be injured by the
operation of the Department of Public
Work-s improving the navigation of a streamn
or water.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Yes, but it may interfere in this way. I had better explaiin
by ci'ting a case. A dam is being built on.
the French river, and it bas beeji and is
now interfering with nav.igation. The building of that dam -bas caused a great dose teo
lumbermen who had been using that river
for the past thirty or forty yeara, and they
theughit they were entittled te compensation, but could net get. any, and did net get
any.

DEPARTMENT 0F RAILWAYS AND

SECOND READING.

Hon.,Smr JAMES LOUGHEED:- moved the
second reading of Bill 42, an Act Vo amend
the Department of Railways and Canais
Act.
He said: This is a Bill Vo give authority
te, the Minister of Railways Vo acquire rolling stock and equipment Vo an amount not
exceeding $50,000,000. It is very necessary
that this equipment be secured for the
purpose o! meeting the demands which are
nov being made upon the departmenit for
rolling stock and motive power. The
Government is called upon, noV on'ly Vo,
furnish rolling stock and motive power for
the road which iV is operating, but also to
assist other roads, which cannot at the moment secure rollinga stock or motive power
froui the different in.dustrial concernis enThe tran-sgaged in itheir manufacture.
portation companies in Canada are at
present confronted uîith the difficulty o!
obtaining sufficient sumrs Vo enable them to
purchase rolling stock. As honourable gentlemen know, our industrial firms are precluded fronu entering the London market
to float any of their debentures, and Vo a
very large extent the American market is
closed to them, and this can be done successfully only through the Govern.ment. It
i noV necessary Vo say that when any
rolling stock or motive power is taken over
from the Government iby the transportation
companies iV is done for a consideratio>n.
Hon. Sir jA3,FES LOUGH25IED.

The Governiment, in operating the National
Transcontinental railway, wilI have to,
'furnish rolling stock for it. This largely
applies also to the Grand Trunk Pacifie; it
applies peculiarly to the Canadian. Northern; and the Goverament will have to gý),
or has already gone, to the extent of loaning motive power to the Canadian Pacifie,
a certain conaideration being given itherefor. It i flot necessary for me to mention
that the building of the rolling stock, as
well as of engines, is dons by tender and i
scrutinized in every possible w.ay.
Hon. Mr. McSWEENEY: What is the
amount of the tenders that have been accepted? This fifty millions is flot the
s.mount originally asked for. The amnounit
originally asàked for was $100,000,000, but
that bas been ceut down, Vo $50,000,000.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: For instance, 75 engines have beeni ordered ior
the Grand T.runk Railway system. $4,500,000 is being expended on enigines alone.
Co'ntraots were given a few weeks &go for
rolling stock valued at practically $33,000,000. Ail the large industrial concerns in
Canada, I believe, have received -their
share of those co.ntracts. The ability of
each comnpany Vo carry out a certain contract has, of course, to be taken inito consideration, but the price which h as been
established, particularly for freight cars, is
practically uniform throughout.
My honouraible
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK:
friend has spoken of this rolling stock being
lem~ed to the railways for -a consideration.
The Bill, 1 understand, provides also that
it can be s-old under some arrangement,
such as the issue of securities or bonds.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I presurme that the
intention iz that this rolling stock shalh
be in some cases perhaps transferred to the
railways, and equipme¶Lt bonds taken as a
recog-nition of the debt?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Instead of tlue transportation companies
placing their equipnuent bonds upon the
market, which t.hey could not successuhIy
do at the present timie, those equipmnent
bonds will be handed over Vo the Dominion
Goverument in satisfaction of whatever
purchases niay be made by those conupanies
of the rolling stock in question. Lt is simply
a method of financing the rolling stock and
equipment generally, in view of the imipossibility of miaking- a flotation on the mnoney

SENATE

246

H1e said: Honourable gentleman, this is
an Act to amend the Criminal Code so as
to provide for the revision of excessive or
!nadequate punishments. 1 think honourable gentlemen who have followed the
criminal law must have been struck by the
fact that ini like cases a light sentence is
sometimes given to one mnan and a very
heavy sentence to another. A criminal is.
always tried by one judge, and es we all
kncw, diflerent judges have different ways
of looki.ng at certain offences. The records
show a great disparity in sentences in
criminal cases. 1 know of a case within the
last month or eo where a man was sentenced
te six inonths for having committed a
crime, and within three months anort.her -man
was sent te the penitentiary for seven years
fot committing a crime of exsctly the aame
kind. Lt often happens that a crimins-i
lawyer who is cute will manoeuvre the case
so as te bring it before a certain judge
whom hie knows te be lenient. There is also
a disparity between judges. In the cîties,
where criminal trials are a common occurrence, the sentence is generally fixed, but
in the country districts, where the commission of certain offences is probably more
rare, and a trial does not happen very
often, a man may receive a very severe
sentence. I was teld the other day by a
gentleman who sat on a commission in a
penitentiary, that he asked any of the
prisoners who had anything to say to come
un and make a etatement-and he would
give them every opportunity of airing their
views. H1e was struck by the fact that the
meni who waited on him said: "Can you
explain how it is that a man who is
sentenced in a city is generally sentenced
for a moderate terni, while one who is tried
and sentenced in a country district receives
a very severe sentence?"
I think culminal sentences are more imiportant than civil judgments. If one is
interested in a civil suit to the extent of
$50, hie can carry it to the Court of Appeal;
buT ini the case of a man who is tried by
a judge, and who may be sentenced to ten
or twentv years in the peaitentiary, the
sentence cannot be revised. The liberty of
the su.bjet should be the first consideration of the law. 1 know of a case of a man
who was sent to the penitentiary for
twenty-one years for stealing an overcoat.
Lt should flot be in the judgment of any
one man te give -a sentence that is out of
proportion to the crime nor to dismiss a
guilty man without any sentence at ail.
This Bill is hedged around and protected
so that no appeal can hie taken unless the
Hon. Mr- MeMEANS.

attorney general of the province in which
the trial takes place gives his, consent. The
f urther safeguard is provided that before an
appeal can be taken the attorney general
must umake a representation te the Mînister
of Justice, 'who can then consent to the case
going be'fore the court of -appeal. I think
the Bill as drafted niigh-t be aniended in
that respect. Lt seems unnecessary that
the matter should be ueferred te the Minister of Justice. Lt should be le! t te the
attorney general of a province, who has
the sole control of the law in that province.
If 'the case were tried in British Columbia,
or in Nova Scotia, or in some other province, it.might ibe very inconvenient to have
to refer to the Minister of Justice.
Hon. Mr. POWER: A.s one member, I do
not wish te be committed to the principle
of this Bill.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I suppose the botter
plan would be te discuss it later on. 1 want
te say somnething -about it.
Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: Say it now.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I will support this
Bill. One of the scandals of the admninistration of criminal justice in Canada since
Confederation has been the d-isparity betwe-ea the sentences, first as between the
judges individually in the different provinces, and again as between the sentences
given by judges in one province as conipared with those given hy judges in another province.
I discustssed this matter once with the late
Sir Johin Thompson, and hie said that when
hie came here as Minister of Justice hie was
horrified at the sentences that lie hiad imiposed in the province of Nova Scotia when
he conipared them wîith the sentences luiposed in the province of Ontario. I know,
as a niatter of fact, that a great m.iany of
the sentences that he had îmiposed in Nova
Scotia were iii part remiitt-ed after hie became Minister o.! Justice, iu order ýto make
themi coincide with the sentences jinposed
in Ontario. I remember one case of a man
mho stole a horse and wagon, who rece.ived
ninetten years in the penitentiary. That
mas in Nova Scotia.
Hion. Mr. POWER: They wan.ted te keep
the standard high.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: They did keep the
standard high. You could knock a man's
brains out and get off for less.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There
might not be as muéh use for them as for
a horse and wagon.

247

APRIL 22, 1918
lion. W. B. ROS-S: There is no proper
check. This Bill will go a long way towards
meeting what is felt on the part af the
public to be a want of senae of proportion
and of what, in the last resort, is justice
and fair play. Mankind in general have
a strong sense of what is right, and it is
a mistake tao shake that sense of justice,
as it breeds a contempt and hatred of the
law. Therefore it 1.8 desirable that. we
should have some machinery foi equalizing
sentences. Possibly, if it were workable.
a central authority might be the béat. As
I have said, this Bill will go a long way.
If the attorney general of a province thinks
a sentence ie too severe, or is nat severe
enough, for a particular crime commnitted,
he cen state a case lor the Supreme Court
of the province, who can deal with it. In
that way, instead of one indiividual judge
dealing with it, there will be five or six
or seven, as the case may be. They will
then be able ta confer with one another,
and compare the sentences which they have
inflicted, and they shauld be able ta make
themselves conversant with the sentences
imposed by judges in other provinces. I
will be vei'y glad ta support this Bill.

COM-

The Senate again went into Committee
on Bill A, an Act ta cansolidate and amend
the Railway Act.-Han. Sir James Lougheed. Hon. Mr. Girroir in the Chair.
On section 302-running o! trains; use of
bath languages:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I suggest
that we take Up section 302. That staod for
this evening at the request of my honourable
iriend from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcaurt).
I moved the- adoption o! subsection 2, and
I think my honourable frienid from DeLorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand> moved an
amendment thereto.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not desire
ta pralong the debats on this clause; but,
as the Committee was not constîtuted on
Friday afternoon as it is to-day. I wou1dt
ask my honourable friends ta grant me a.
littie of their patience, that I .may state
in a few words how the question stands.
Section 302 contained three siibsections
when the Bill came from the House of
Commons last year. The section as it is
to-day befare us contains only the first two
subsections. The third subsection, which,
as I arn informed, had the support of the
Minister o! Railways and was adopted
unanirnously in the House o! Commons, is
not -ta be !ou.nd in thé Bill as presented to
this Chamber this year. It reads as foilows:
Âfter the flrst day of January, one thousand
fine hundred and nineteen. the Board niay f rorn
timne to timne make such orders and regulations
as it may deein advlsable ta provide that ail or
any railway employees on local passenger trains
running in the province of Quebec shall be conversant wlth the English and French languages.

I stated on Friday that, siuice this clause
had been adopt.ed by the Commons, the
responsibility for striking it out rested with
the Senate; and, in the event o! the Bill
returning ta the Conimons wit.hout that
clause, its absence would be iioted in the
other Ohamber and therefore it is proper
for the Senate to give reasons why it has
been dropped.

Here are .the reasons given by the employees themselves: fiTrt-and I think it
must be the main reason-it may thwart
or hinder the full .play o! the seniority rigbta
of the employees. Well, honourable gentlemen, I said on Friday. and 1 wank to repeat now, that 'the railways and railway
employeea have not been created for their

public. I understand that a public cornmodity is -for the public at large; and,

Hon. Mr. OLORAN: They would lire him.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If you can
imagine sucli a state of things in your own
section of the country, then you can understand the feeling in the province of Que-bec, where trains leave Montreal for Quebec daily and ottener, and run from Quebec to ]Rimouski and farther east, passing
through a section of the country where
nine-ten-ths of the population are French;
or leave Montreal and. run northwards to
Ste. Agathe and La Tuque, where ninetyfive per cent o~f the population is French;
or run from Montreal through the Eastern
Townships, where the population is mixed;

races who are there. 1 shaîl be answered:
"But that situation lias existed for the last
thirty years, and things have run on
smocthly: *no coxnplaints have arisen." I
must repeat that 1 have seen cases in which
I have been obliged to intervene-- and I
do not travel very much. If I were a commercial traveller, I suppose I could give
you numberless instances in which I had
been obliged to intervene to 'bring about
understanding.
It is in the interest of the railways that
they should serve the public in such a way
as to prevent any grievance arising. But
the Senate of Canada is now face to face
with a -clause passed una.nimously by the
House o! Comnons. "But," you will say,
"it was not before us until you proposed
to add it." No, but it 'was before us last
year, and when the Bill returns to the
Commons that clause will be in it or it
will not. Its dîsappearance will be our
action, od.ur omission. It is welU to face the
question squarely and to decide if it is
worth whule raising the question whethe-r
we are giving more importance to the question than it deserves. I will admit that
the railways generally make an effort to
satisfy the public, yet there are cases where
such a g-rievance rwould exist and where it
may exist juat now. When ail that is asked

ie adopted, a certain number of French
Canadians living in British Columbia wiil

enough to tell me bow many French Caniadians there are in British Columbia whr
do not speak English.
[Hon. Mr. CLORAN.]

Hon. Mr. CLORAN: I don't, suppose

Hon. Mr. BOYER: Suppose there are a
hundred, two hundred, three hundred, five
hu.ndred, five thousand, is it just and right
that a million-and-a-half of people in Qubec should suifer because five thousand of
their compatriots have seen fit to leave
their own province and go and live in British Columbia?
Hon. Mr. POPE: I would like bo ask the
honourable member if he saya, there are
half a million people in the province of
Quehec who do flot understand English.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: Oh, my, no. Th~en
why should we flot follow the example of
all the big English and French railways?
On every railway train, on every steamer
that crosses the Enghicli channel from Calais or Boulogne to Dover or Folkestone,
the minute il reaches England you have
half-a-dozen interpreters at the service of
whomsoever cannot speak English. If you
happen 10 cross from Folkestone or Dover
to Boulog-ne or Calais the French Government or the French railway companies have
a dozen interpretere, entirely free cf
charge. at the service of Englieh-speaking people who do not speak French,
and they are ready to give aIl information
re.quired. Now, in the province of Quebec,
although the country has been setutled for
many years, new districts are being colonized every day, railways have been i-un
in. and it has heen mny experience, flot once
but a dozen of timrnes, te hear a conductor
ask, -"Anybody speaking French on this
train?" I answer - Yes,- and the conductor cave. " Would you be So kind as to
ask this lady what she requires?-there je
a diflerence between the two of us." Do
you know what the difference ýwas? Ten
cents; and they could not understand one
another. If he conductor could bave said
two u'ords in French, "Dix sous,." she
would have understood hirn. He insisted
on savirîg, - Ten cents," and the old lady
did not understand. There are now two
men on each train; ýthere je the conductor
and a modemn invention called the train
nian-because the breaks have been done
away with; aîîd, as üh.is is a li-ft up, I suppose hie will be a colonel next. Now, why
should not ene of those two be required'
to unders-tand French?

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: To, my mind the
refusal of this amendmnent ains against one
of the very iprominént sections of the
British North Amarica Act. My honourable friend from Walland <Hon. Mr. Robertson) in his observations the o'ther day
ref&rred te section 133 of that Act. I do
not rise to repeat the arguments that have
been advanced; but I wish to present an
argument in lfavour of the amendment proposed that is to me unanaverable. In the
province of Quebec froin *one end to tha
other we have a Government railway, running from Montreal to Halifax. People are
en-titlad under the constitution to be q»oken
to in French on that railway. Nov, what
are you going- to -say to that? Are you
going to refuse to apply the constitution on
Governnment railways? There is just as
much necessity for coniductors in the province of Quebec being able to speak both
languages as there is for money orders
and posctal notes and aIl the literature in
the savings banks of the Govarrument oif
Canada to be printed in both languages.
Where is the dietincetion. batween the postal

banks, not only in Quebec but in the othar
provinces, including OntaBrio and British
Columbia, are printed in both languages. I
put it Io the Housa if the refusai of this
amendinent is not a distinct and positive
refusal to apply section 133 of the British'

(Hon. M.r. ROBERTSON: I amrn ot a
lawyer, but I believe t.hat the very section
of the British North Aimerica Act cited
by my honourable friend from, Ottawa 4Hofl.
,Mr. Bel'oourt> gives one the right to plead
his cse in any court within tihe province
of Quebeg- in either of th~e tIwo languages.
Hon. IMr. CLORALN: There is no doubt
about thiat.
Hon. Mr. ROBERITSON: And if my honourable -friend from Victoria <Hon. Mr.
Cloran) were conduceting the prosecution of
a case, and spoke in Frencoh, 'while I, act-~
ing as attorney for the defendant, was
speaking in 'Engliali, and he could not underetand what I aaid or 1 could not understand what he eaid, yet we would both be
exercising our rights, as 1 -understand the
law. Therefore the comparison my hon.ourable friend from, Ottawa <Hon. Mr.
Belcourt) draws would be exactly parallel
to the present 'qituation, and the quotation
ha makes froin the British North Anierica
Avct has, in effeet, a force exactly opposite
to that whieh he gives it.

that is under the British North Anierica

over that if you can.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If it were desirable to say some things that might be
said in connection with this question I
might enlarge a good deal upon the subi ect,
but I think it would not be wise to deviate
too far from the subject in question, or
spread out into too wide a field. I do not
propose to go over the ground that was
covered on Friday afternoon further than
to call attention again briefly to the main
reasons why the railway employees, in
particular, and why I, as a humble meniber
of this House, feel that this amendment
ought not to prevail. I stated. then that
for more than thirty years these conditions

SENÂTE
have been in force, and no complaint has
ever corne to Parliament of which we have
any record; that the gentleman who introduced this meaisure in the House of Coinmens last year did nlot quote a single
incident to justify its introduction; that
another honourable, gentleman in the House
of Commons, speaking in support of the
measure, did mention an incident which
in his opinion justified the enactmlent, af
this legisiation; that
the information
that was given in the other -House
incorais to this case was wholly
rect, the facts being the very reverse;
and the honourable gentleman froin De
Salaberry <Hlon. Mr. Béique) says to-night
that that was a prank and it ought not to
be regarded as a seriaus matter at ail. I
may say for the information of the honourable gentleman that this very day, since
the House opened this afternoon, four rail,way conductors have corne ta me and testified te havîng had similar experiences.
Therefore it is beyond question that these
incidents have occurred, and I do not propose te dwell on them further. The railv-ay employees state most emphatically
that the French Canadian members of th.eir
organ ization do not desire this legisiation,
because it would be detrimental to them.
The English-speaking members do nlot desire it, becauffl they think it would discriminate against them. There is no gainsaying the fact that the proposal is utterly
impracticable so far as concerns the five
rcads entering the province of Quebec froin
the Amierican side, because this Parliarnent
has certainly no authority to say to the
United States, which naw controis these
roads: -You must man those trains with
French Canadians or persans able to speak
beth languages."
Hon. Mr. DANDURtiNU: We are not
claiming the right ta interfere %vith those
roads.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That was the
effeet of the honourable gentlernan's arnendment in the first place; and if vau do not
ir-clude those roads, then honaurable gentiernen are admitting- ihiat in certain partions of the provincte of Quebec the provision is flot necessary. but in ollher partians it is.
Han. Mr. CASGRAIN: Why nat have an
interpreter?
Hon. Mr. ROIB.ERTSON: With reference
ta th-e qucstion of interpreters. -which has
been raised hy honourable gentlemen w1wt
have spoken, it has been stated that for
passengers crossing fram England ta France
-.nterpreters are provided where they are
[Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.]

necessary. To my certain knowledge-and
1 may say that 1 worked on a railway in
the province af Quebec for six years, have
many close personal friends among the
French Canadians in that province, and
know whereof I speak-in the operation of
trains in the province of Quebec it is the
practioe of ail the railway companies, if
the conductor on a particular train is not
thoroughly familiar wi-th the French ianguage, to have on tihe saine train a French
Canadian brakeinan, and there is no doubt
that any person an the train can find an
interpreter in the person of either the conductor or the brakemnan.
Hon. Mr. GLORAN: They do not db it
to-day.

~Hon. Mr. ROBERTION: It may not be
convenient to do it just at a particular
moment; the brakeman may be in an
adjacent car; but 1 say that an employee
able ta Bpeak French is available.
Aitcgether tao much stress is being laid upon
the contention that the passenger has no
way af obtaining seine one ta act as anl
interpreier, because there is net one case
in a thousand where that couid possibly
occur.
The honourable gentleman frein De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) sa.id that we
should atteznpt ta look through the other
fellow's glas&es, or, in other words, as he
put it, that we should put ourselves in the
other fellow's shoes. 1 wouid like ta say ta
the honourable gentleman that there are a
great mnany railroad men in the province of
Quebec who would be glad ta lend him a
pair of their boots right nov', if he desires
ta put hi-mself into their shoes, as he has
suggested.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE:

Would t.hey be

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If the honourable
gentleman (Mr. Dandurand) viewed the
matter framn their standpoint lie would arrive at a far different conclusion.
I want ta make only one other observation, and that is ta point out what I regard
as an absolutely cseriaus side of the situation, entirely apart from its effect upan the
raîlway employees. Unfortunately, tliere
bas been in years paat, and perhaps there
will be in years ta corne, too much stress
laid upon the question of what language
should be spoken in this or in that loality.
That particular qilestion bas caused a lack
of harmony in many parts of titis country
in times past, and ought nlot ta be revived
more often than is absolutely necessary.
We should endeavour ta overcome the dif-

APIRIL 22, 1918
ficulty.
I say to the people of the
province of Quebec in particular and to
many French-speaking people in other
provinces of this counîtry, that that very
provision o.f the British North America Act
which gives to the Canadian citizen the
right to speak the official language of his
choice is of immense value and must be
dear indeed to the heart of every Frenchspeaking Canadian,-Hon. Mr. LILORAN: No doubt about that.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON :-and if tis
amendment should prevail, if this proposed
clause is inserted in the Raiiway Act, Parliament declares in effect: " We have the
power to ignore the provisions and requirements of the British North America Act, and
we are going to impose upon a certain class
of our citizens the obligation of spea-king
both languages, under pain of losing the
exnploymerit which they have worked for 30
years to obtain. "
Hon. Mr. OLOR.AN: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If the aniendmieut is adopted, that is what is bound to
happen.
If it is right to ignore the
provisions of the constitution of this country
in -one case, it wili be in another. Il we
permit that situation to arise, it w~ill bring
about a controversy which wili become
e.cute throughout this country. I say,
honourable gentlemen, that there has been
no specific instance, correctiy or accurately
quoted, that would show the necessity for
the passage of this proposed subsection,Hon. Mr. CLORAN: The entire press of
Quebec are demanding 'this change.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Order.
Hion. Mr. ROBERTSON: -and there is
ample evidence coming in froni many and
varions isources that it is not necessary
and ought flot teo be enacted. But, entirely
part from the local reasons or arguments
that have been advanced, I do t.hink thait
you are striking at the very rock upon
which the liberty oof the French-speaking
people -is founded if you enact that clause.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: Oh, no.
Hon. Mx. ROBERTSON: Therefore I
hope, not only in the interests of the railroad men, but in the intereste of ail our
Canadian citizens, tohat we will not interfere
with the principle that has been adopted
and has been in effect for se long.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Honourable gentlemen, I -have lîs'tened with a great deai cf
attention to what the honourable niember

255

for Welland (Hon. Mx,. Robertson.) bas said.
Personally I cannot see that the arguments
'that hie pute forwaSd apply t<> thii p>articular clause. If t!he clause were mandat-.
ory in istating that 'the Board should do
certain things, I could underetand fhe
honourable gen'tleman's contentions, but
'this clause on.ly leaves the niatter in the
hands o-i tibe Board, and the Board may do
wbat they tbink adv'isable in the .nterests
of tihe general public. The clause had been
put into the Bill, as itwss brought up to
'thie Chamber last session, by the members
of the House of Commona. They seemed
to think that it was a wise and proper provision to insert ini the Bill, and ail we are
asked to do st 'the present Urne lis to replace
tihat clause in the BiU that is now before
us. Sueli a clause leaves it at the diacretion of thxe Board 'to take action ini the matter tif they think it ia in 'the public interest
to do so. They are not compelled to take
action unless they do Vbink it la wise and
in the public intereat. TheTefore I cannot
for myseîf see the soundness of the argument put forward by the honourable gentleman that we are 'treating this matter in
away which is detrimen'tal to *the railway
employees.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, this is not a new question.
Rince Confederation iA has been, like the
poor, always with ue. In 1867 the Fathers
of Confederation readily foresaw the difficulties which wouid arise respecting the
use of both languages, and section 133 of
the British North America Act was passed
accordingly. That section emibodies the
policy oi Canada with respect to the use of
both languages, a policy w.hichhbas been consistently observed from Confederation down
to the present time. Every Government bas
resisted any invasion that was attempted
upon the principle embodied in that section,
not.withstanding the pressure which has
been brought to bear from time to time to
have a departure made in an acknowledgment of the principle that the use of both
languages, instead of eithex language,
should be made obligatory in the province
of Quehiec. I understand my honourable
friend from Ottawa to contend that the
principle embodied in section 133 is that
not only shouid both languages be used in
the officiai literature of the province, but
both langauagaes should be obligatory upon
those residing in the province of Quebec or
elsewhere.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: I did not say that.

a man is appointed by the Government as
postmaster in a parish where the people
speak only the French language and do

net speak or understand French, would
not the peoeple 'be entitled to denand that

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I ain net
going to follow~ the sophistries of my
honeurable friend (Hon. M.Nr. Béique),
because we are discussing here a constitutional right enjoyed by every citizen of

Act; and I say that the Government would
be recreant to the trust reposed in it u-ere
it to seek te violate that pninciple, which
is one of the bulwarks of the liberty of the
subject in Canada, by imposing upon the
subject an impossible condition. But myv
honourable friend frem De Salaberry (Hon.
Mr. Béique) asks me: "' I it not the duty
of the Government to impose by statute

should cast to the winds the prînciple te
which 1 have referred, and im~pose this
obligation upon every railway employee in
the province of Quebec.
Now, I am informed that the railway
employees on those roads in the province
of Quebec, se fan as it is at. ail possible,
èspeak French and English; and it is within the realmms of possibility that practicaUly ail the employees speak both ianguages. Is it flot unreaeonable te suppose
that the railways of the province of Quebec will ignore the sentiment of the people
o! that province by neglecting to place in
charge o! their trains em.ployees who can

pasrenger-and I defy him to show that
such a statemnent has ever been made-he
would not be permitted to remain on the
train twenty-four hours; he would not be
allowed to rernain any longer than 'was
necessary to re-ach the end of his journey.
T.c makze a statemnent like that to go on
record and to go abroad through the country is unfair, uncalled for, and ought to be
apologized for by the honourable gentleman
who makes it.
Hon. Mr. -CLORAN: I would oertainly
apologize if what I said were not true, but
1 cannot forego my own eyesight and my
own ears. Does the honourable mainister
understand that? That is the state-ment
that I make here. I do nmot say that every
conductor is impolite; but 1 tell you that
where there is one case of impoliteness on
thr part of a passenger you wîll find ten
on the other aide.
Hon. .Mr. PLANTA: M-%ay I ask a question?
Bon. -Mr. CLORAN: Let me deal with
this honourable gentleman first.
Hon. MNr. PLANTA: May I ask a question?
Like Sir Boy le
Hon. Mr. CiLORAýN:
Roche, I cannot be in two places at once.
Now, there is a staternent. You have heard
the honourable gentlemran from De Salaberry <Hon. 'Mr. Béique), the honourable
g-entlemnan from De Lanaudiere <Hon. Mr.
Casg-rainX, and others say that scenes have
occurred on trains. I m-as not on their
trains, but I make tue statenient now and
do not withdraw~ it. I do flot charge the
45,000 railwvay einployees of this country
with iinîpolitenessz; I charge that. there arc
somne wvho are inipolite. and one is 100
m any, especially when serving- the public.
That is the apol.gy 1 niake.
Hon. 'Mr. ROBERTSON: I should like
Io remnind the honourable gentlenan that
-thie exception is always found to the rule.
It inay perlhap.z he fouiff ini this honourable House.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: Iliere is no doubt
about that.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Therefore he
should flot put aIl the conductors in that

say one thing: it is a fact that the conductor has a heavy load on his shoulders,
and sometimes is in a hurry and cannot
stop to have a conversation wvith a passenger -who wants information. I have sometimes seen a slighlt appearance of rudeneas
on the part of conductors who were hurrving from one end of the train to the other,
and 1 have noticed that it has a very depressing effeet on the humble people who
happen to be travelling for the first time,
or -who travel perhaps once in a year, and
who are puzzled as to sorne difficulty and
have become nervous. Then we have had
to intervene in the effort to explain to the
passenger what the conductor had said and
that had not been understood. It is ohvious that in order to give good public
service in a section like the province of Que
bec, a conductor should speak the two ianguages. Ail I say t-o any honourable friend
who leads the Governiuient in this House is
that the position that hie takes, and that
some of bis friend& take, is to mie nioct discouraging for the future of this country.
The honourable
Hon. 'Mr. CLORAN:
gentleman who bas taken his seat corroborates ail that I have said, in spite of the
protestation wbich 1 believe wvas honestly
made. The lionourable minister does flot
travel in that province as rnuch as we do.
He lias not been throug-h election campaigns. travelling iroîji village to village
and frorn pillar to post. We have seen a
g-ood deal of the country. It is a long tirne
since the honourable zentleman lias travelled iu Quebec.

remember that the complaint is not made
again st the 45,000 eînployees; it is against
probably a half-a-dozen; but that is six too
m any.
I am not asking to have the 45,000 employees of the railivay companies in this;
country made to speak both languag-es. Tbe
miinister will admit that I arn fair, and that
I do flot ask that any man who bas notbing
to do with the public should speak either
English or Frencb. I arn willing that a
Russian, who speaks neither, should have
work. The railways to-day are seeking allen
labour--Chinese who cannot speak a word
of French or English. I would be the last
man to refuse the rigbt of labour in that
regard. But when a corporation is authorized by Act of Parliarnent to do business on
stich a scale as railvays are, its ernployees
who corne in close contact with the public
should know the language of that public.
Is that extraordinary? Ls that preaching
discord, as the bonourabie leader of the
Government says? Is tbat preaching disunion in the countrv? I do not think it la.
I think I put it well when I said that if
what happens in Quebec were to happen in
Ontario you would not dare to put a man
on a train, local or other-wise, who could
not speak Englisb. He would not be on
that train nor in tbe service tw-enty-!our
hours. In Quebec we do not do that. We
do not ask that tiS man wbo cannot understand French sbould be dismiisszed. 1 have

Tlitre is objection to puttîng in sectiùii

covers both.of them, either moros or along,

there are special powers given to the Railway Board.
Hon. Mr. WATSON:- Do I understand that
this iamendmient would provide for a railway company running a high voltage po-wer

<Hon. Mr. Watson) that any compsny would

Hon. W. B. ROSS: It 'was my intention
to cover the point sny honourable friend

its eenployees, ebould mot have a high tension wire 1there.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Or in the interest of
the travelling publie. I have seen the
traffic in Toronto blocked coxnpletely by
a wire falling over the track. As the amendment reads, it seems to mie it would exempt

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The amendment
covers wires for power -also. My honourable fIrend bhas not said definitely whether
thst would not permit txhe railway coqnpany
to string higii voltage wires along the railway without thé consent orî permission of
the Board.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: No, I do not think so.
If there is the slightest doubt about it, we
'will have te get words to remove any doubt.
Hon. Mr. -MACDONELL: This is, a viery
important section, dealing with at least
three sections which have been careful.ly

As this is the firet notice vwe have liad o!

Hon. W. B. ROSS: The words: "devices,

Hon. Mr. WATSON: We ought to make
it perfectly clear that a railway company

-Hon. W. B. ROSS: I agree with my honourable ffriend from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Macdoneli) that there is a good deal of crisscroasing cif sections; and, ùe there is no. desire to get thie through in anything like a

On section 11-agree'ment for sale, lease
or amalgamation of railway:
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I would like to tnove
an amendment to section 151 of the Act
'which provides for theae agreemnents being
voted upon and approved by two-thirds o!
the votes of the shareholders of each cornpany party theretà. The principle is ai-ready in practice, and there are a number
of agreements of very amali consequence,

which do noV involve amalgamation at ail,
but cannot bcecntered into without obtaining the atpproval mentioned, which at times
is very difficuit. In fact, li one company
with which I have met, a large number o!
sharehoiders are distributed in foreign
ceuntries e0 that it was absolutely impossible Vo obtain their consent. I would
therefore suggest the following additional
subsection:
8. Whenever the. agreement does flot invoive

any amalgamnation, and may b. termlnated by
etther company on givt a notice flot excee5'a-g
twelve months, the. Board may, notwithstin'ing
anything in thus section, by order or regulai lon,
exempt the company from complyinz; wlthi any
of the foregolng conditions with respcc: te any
such agreement
It will b. seen that it wouid have Vo be
an ag&reement which would not involve, any
amalgamnation, and which oould be be, dissoived by a mere notice not exceeding
twelve months, so that it wouid leave the

shareholders perfectly free and flot coinmitted by any agreement which was approved by the board.
-I may state that an honourabie member
sent me another draft o! the same clause,
which I desire to put before the House. It
was to this effect-that the board, notwithstanding anything in this section, may by
order or regulation exempt the company
from complying with any of the foregoing
conditions with respect te any agreement
for selling, conveying or leasing to

any

such comipany, or for any agreement where
the consent of the railways is deemed to bo
unnecessary. I put the two foins before
the House so that the inatter may be discussed to-morrow.

Bill A, an Act to consolidaie and amend

Hon. Mr. Girroir in the Chair.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen, di there is no objection, I would like
the coinmittee to take up sections 372 and
372A. For the information of the gentlemen who have not been following this matter closely, I may say that I understand
th-at there is no difference of opinion in
the House with regard ta the proposed
amendment. The two sections were meant
ta deal with two separate things. The first
was the building of wires or lines across or
along the lines of an existing railway company by another company. The second was
the construction along the Uine of the railway -by the railway compa-ny itself of wires
carrying heavy currents for e]ectîic lighting
and power purposes. For these two sections,
372 and 372A, I move to substitute the
fol]owinga:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUG!IEID.

adopted or evproved by the Board 'for sud'
purpases.
RL.. c. 37, a. 246; 1911. c. 22, s. 7. 1917.
c. 37, a. 4. Am
The first four aâections deal effectively
with the first question, but they leave out

the other question, namely, how to deal
with power and light lines carrying heavy
currents that are constructed on the railway
by the railway company itseli.
I pointed out yesterday that section 287
provides for the orders and regulations of
the board, and the operation and equipment
of a company. In subsection g of that section, to enable the Railway Board to contrai
what should be built upon a railway by the
railway company itself, I arn going ta suggest a slight amendunent. I do flot know
that it is absolutely necessary, but I thînk
it will meet with the views of those who
were yesiterday rather doubtful about it.
Subsection g reads in this way:
The Board may make orders and regulations,<g) with
rspect to the rolling stock
apparatus, cattle guards, applia-xe, sigTýals,
xnethode, devices, structures a.nd worka, ta lie
used uvon Oie railway. so as ta provide meane
for Oie due protection oif propertY, the employees of the coampany, anxd the publie and
ail persons travelling on Mis IMajesty'a service.

The amendment which I propose is that
we should add after the words, - structures
and works-," the words - including power

and lighti.ng wires."

That provision will

APRIL 23, 1918
make it absolutely certain that the Railway
Board 'will have the regulation ai that subject. That is te say, if the railway coimpanies put a power or lighting liue along
the liue of railway the Bailway Board will
regulate that and will maie orders ito pravide
means for the due protection ai property,
and 13o on. Wheii that amendment is made,
I think bath subjects will be covered.
The, insertion of section 372A lias rather
thro'wn the whole Bill out of joint. The sectioe.s are inte.rlocked sud interwoven, -butby
keeping 372 ta eue subject and insertiug
these word8 in aubsection g od section 287,
this 'will be cured. 1 hope that 1
do not -rnisrepreseut anyone when 1
say that I think there is flot any
difference ai opinion on thii amendment. 1
amn simply trying te make sections 372 and
372A as ameuded more workable aud te
dovetail theni into the Act. I have ne desire to lessen the obligation ci the railway

On section 151-agreeniente for ' sale,
lease sud amalgamation:
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: With the leave of the
committee, I would suggest that the amendment of which 1 gave notice be amended
to read as follows:
S. Whenever the agreement de flot Involve
any sale or amalgamation and may be termnzted by etther conWany on g1ving a notice
not exceeding tirelfve months, taie Board may,
nothwlthstantting anythlng la tahie section, by
order or reultion, exempt the conmvany froin
oemplylng with Bfly of the feregalng conditions with respect to any such agreement.
Under isection 151, whenever any agreemeuts whereby any part ai a railway is
conveyed or otherwise disposed of or
affected, it is necessary ta obtain the consent oi two-thirds ai the shareholders. In
practice it is absolutely impossible in mauy
caser. ta obtain such consent. There are a
nuinher of agreements which are ai ne importance-agreements whereby, for instance,
one railway allows another railway te use
its Uines jeintly with itself. -Such agreements, aithougli nat iuterfering at ail with
the ownership ai the praperty and net
being in the nature of a sale or amalgamation, nevertheless cannot be miade wlthout the consent ai twa-thirds af the shareholders. I propose the amendment in order
ta obviate thu.t difflculty. It will be seen
that it is limited te cases where the agreement does not involve any sale or amalgamation, aud xnay be termînated by either
compauy on its giviug a notice net exceeding twelve months.

266

SENATE

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We will
accept that.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: So that the shareholders, wi.ll not be committed and may
dispose of the agreement as they like.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: Speaking as a
laym'an, and recognizing fully the difficulty
which often exista of getting as many as
two-t.hirds of the shareholders together, and
recognizing also that this amendment has
valuable qualities, it seema te me that it
rn'ay perhaps go too far. As I understand
it, it means that there would be no notice
to the shareholders-no public notice in
cases where a purchase or a lease was in
contemplation.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It merely gives ta
the board the power ta dispense with such
notice, if the board deeros advisable. If
the egreenient is of any.consequence the
board will aurely see to it that ail the required notices are given.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: The conlpany's
difficulty might, b. removed in this way.
If the com.painy tried ta get a. meeting o!
shareholders and could not get the requisite two-thirds, then the board migbt
dispense 'with formalîties. The absence
of publicity, it seems ta me, *might be objectionable.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The -agreement may be terminated on 12 months' notice anyway. It is only a running agreement.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would draw
the honouraibie gentleman's attention ta the
fact that there are very many such agreements made yearly, and considerable
trouble would be caused to the companies if
the shareholders had ta be convened. It
wouid be for the board ta decide whether
it would be necessary ta notîfy the shareholders. Then, the agreement may be terrninated within twelve months.
The amendment o! Hon. Mr. Béique was
agreed ta.
Hon. W. B. BOSS: There is a good deal
o! objection ta subsection 6 of section 151,
and I propose ta crystallize the objection
in an amendment. I move that in lieu of
subsection 6 the following be inserted:

ta the Governor lni CounciL

The effect of this amendment is to give
some show too the provincial legisiatures
wjth regard to railways in the provinces,
and not summarily to hand them over ta
Dominion juriadiction.
Hon. Mr. CÂSGBAIN: In the case-of a
road belonging to a provincial government.
would you not need the consent of that
government before you could remove the
railway from its jurisdiction?
Hon. W. B. ROoel: You would, but this
only provides for a report from the board
to the Governor in Coundi1. Then, if the
Governor in Coundil waiits to have an Act
of Parliament passed to take the roed from
jurisdiction of the provincial parliste
ment, that can be done. This proposed
amendment gives the right of an investigLtion before the Railway Board before the
province can be taken by the throat. It
puts that measure of protection between
the province and the Dominion authorities.
Hon. Mr. BEWÀOURT: Should not my
honourable friend provide ini his amendment for some investigation by the board?
The arnendment as proposed leaves it *to
the board to makis a report of that kind
to the Governor in Council without any
-.
investigation at ail.
Hon. W. B. BOSS: Do they do such a
thing'
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: Should they flot
do it? Should flot a report of that kind
be made only alter an investigation? I
think the amendment ought ta provide for
an investigation.
Hon. W. B. ROSS:- But is there flot some
provision which requires the Railway Commission ta investigate everything, and give
reasons for making an order to ail the
interested parties?
Ilion. Mr. RELiOOURT; The honourable
geèntlernan's amendment does not proyide
that the report shall be 'nade after the
p-trties are he-ard. Without a provision of
that kind, the board could make a report
without hearing any party at ail.
Hon, W. B. BOSS:- If there is danger
of that. I have no objection ta inserting
the words, "after hearing ail parti-es interested,"' after the words, "the Board."
Then, subsection 6 of the Bill disappears
altogether.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: Wourld the honourable gentleman substitute the word
znay - for the word - shall "?

APRIL 23, 1918
Hon. W. B. ROoe: I have no choice
mysell. Perhaps it would be better to use
the word *'shall" so that there inay be
nb argument ais to what it meane.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: I -suggested the
wc.rd " may " instead cf " shall," the word
used in the amexndment.
Hon. W. B. ROM: I do net care which
is used. The amendment means that a
duty is oast on the Railway Board which
they will>have te perform.
The emendment was agreed to, and sectien 151, as amended, vas agreed te.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: What about the

Hon. W. B. ROSS: 1 would leave that

there ia a continuation cf damage. I see
no reason for changing that.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL - I think t.hat the

Hon. W. B. ROSS: The honourable gentleman will sec that the last three lines of the
subsection make ample provision for -what
he refera to--if there is continuation o!

a difference of -opinion about this matter,

On section 184-branch limes; provisions

Hom. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The question has arisen as toe whether 'the provisions

The proposal is 'to amend section 184 by
siubstituting in tihe third line of 'the section
thse wordç -and ".figures: "'sections 171 and
172" 'for the word "thoae" in tuhe top line,

171 applies to branch lines. Section 184
would 'then read:

On -cubsection c of section 6-railwaye
controlled or operated by Dominion comnpsnies:

Hon. W. B. ROSS: When dealing with
section 151, we dealt wdth railways -in respect of which contracts for sale, lease or
amalgamation were being made. Subsection c is another way by which the Parliament of Canada is attempting to get jurisdiction over provîÏncial railways.
It is
worth the while af honourable gentlemen to
look flrst at section 7, *which says:
Where any Tallway, thse construction or

The amendment of Hon. W. B. Ross was
agreed to, and subsection c of section 6 was
struck out.
'On subsection 2 of section 33-mandatoTy
orders:
Hon. W, B. ROSS: I move that the words
"or authorized," in iin6s 25 and 26, be
struçk out. A railway company may be incorporated to build a iroad between point
A and point B, and we guard against its
abusing the power given bo it to do that by
saying that unless it commences operations
within two years its charter becomes nuli
and void; but to say that the railway coInpany must Ibuild between point A and point
B, the day after it gets its charter--4hat it
sh-all commence construction forthwith, before it bas had fts engineers out or made a
proper survey o! the whole line, would, I
think, be all wrong. 1 do not -think those
words, '"or authorized " ought to bs in that
section at ail.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN. But there is' an
easier provision than that. Railway companies are authorîzed to build hotels, and
they coulé be asked to build a hotel at
every station. So I think it is quite right
to strike out the words, "or authorized."
Hon. Mr. DANIEL-' Would not that te
going a littie to-o f ar? Supposing a comnpany gets a charter to build a certain railway, pays no attention to the obligations
of its charter and does flot go on with thje
work; under this amendment you t.ake away
the authority of the board to use any
urgency or to compel the conipany to carry
ont its work.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: The honourable gentleman did not catch what 1 said ta minute
ago. In the incorporation of these companies there is aI-ways a time limit of two
years. The werk must be completed -within
two years or muât be dropped.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If we gave to
the board authority to force a com-pany te
do a certain thing, the board rnight perhaops
have to provide money to do the work.
Very often the work is not done because
the conrpany han not the money. In the
Railway Co'inmittee we have very otten
heard the question put: "*Why ehould not
the coinpany, which has the power to build
a branch lins, Ibe7 compelled te do so P" The
answer of the oompauy bas been: "We
proceed according to te amount of money
we have at our disposal."
Hou. Mr. BELCOURT: Th leave in the
-words "or authorized' would cause a'
,usurpation of the powers. o! Parliament by
the board. The board would be doing what
Parliament alone has the power .to do.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We have
authonized snany comnpanies. te build

cour-se, the board would not concern itacîf
with such matters, and it seems te me that
so long as we give power to'the 'board to

it will be. sufficient if the clause reads,

On subsection. 2 of section 369-and mubsection 2 of section 376-telegrapit and telephone bIlla:
Hon. W. B. BOSS: I move that the words,
"'telegrapits or," in the third lime ci euhsection 2 of section 369 be struck out. As
honourable gentlemen are aware, there are
a number of private wires. For instance,
there are brokers who have thqir owu

SENATE

*Hon, W. B. ROSS: I gave a specific
case, that of brokers in Halifax who have
private wires. The lease of a private wire
is a contract between the broker and the
telegraph company, in which the generai
pub~lic are flot interested at ail. The clause
ws it stands interferes with such private
arrangements.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT:
In what way
*would that conflict with section 376? Subsection 2 of section 369 says that no toli or
charge shall be demanded except in acoord.ance with section 376.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It takes
out telegraph toill.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Subsection 2 of section 369 interferes with the right of private
cQntraet between the telegraph coxnpany
and a private concern.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I could
,understand my honourable friend (Hon.
W. B. Ross) suggesting that the leasing of
a telegrapli fine from which no tolls are
chargeable to the public should not have
to be subinitted to the -board; but the
proposed amendment would net make that
provision. It seema tome that that must be
speciecally stated. Thîs subsection makes
provision for the submiasion to the board
o! ail charges or toill, etc.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Subsection 2 of
section 369 provides, if I un4erstand it
aright, that no toila shall ha demanded
except a toil approved by the board under
section 376. What is there in that to prevent a railway company from making an
agreement with any company for the transmission cf private -messages? 1 cannot see
that there is anything.

no toli or charge shali be made for the use
cf a telegraph or telephone wire unless the
charge is made in accordance with toilaz revised and approved by the board. I do not
quite see why the company could net make
a private arrangement for the -transmission
of private messages.

for the transmission

The provisions, of this section shall fot apply
to the lease of telegraph wires where no toil is
charged te the public.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: As the section reads,
prohibition regarding charges is absolute.
The object of the amendment -proposed by
the honourable gentleman &rom Middleton
(Hon. W. B. Boss) is to permit a railway
,.company owning a teiegraph line to lease
it to another company.
Hon. Mr. BELCO1RT: And te charge

not coneerned at adi.
Hon. W. B. BOSS: No.

Hon. Mr. BELOOURT:

way, what he proposes? Why flot simpiy
say that nothing shall prevent the cosnpany
Irom making a private contractP
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes. If
-honourable gentlemen will turn te subsection: 2 of! section ,376, which is the section
referred te, in section 369, they will find
Hon. W. B. BOSS: Subsection 2 of sec- -that it deals with the qsame s-ubject. The
whode situation would be met by a pro,tion 369 reads:

The effect of that is to preclude the leasi.ng of a private telegraph line.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE:

Why?

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It would prohibit
.perhaps the charging for a message, but
not the leasing.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Yes, it doez.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No; it de-clares
that no charge shall be made for leasing or

exercised over the recent change In section 2.
subsection 15, whereby easemnents and servitudes
are placed under the definition of *'lands." This
wiii Introduce great difficuity In citles, towns
and villages, by givlng the right, practicaiiy,
to llght and power companles to put their wires
over and under private property. This is ail
right In the country, but wili very much depreFor
ciate city and town property in any case.
this reason. easemnents and servitudes were originally omnitted from the Act, but now are
thoughtlessiy put back again.
This matter was the subject of a resolution Of
the Executlve of the Union of Canadian Mfunicipalities on the lOth April, Instant, and they
would ask your good offices to have easemnents
excluded from applications or expropriation
matters In cities and towns.

This letter s.peaks for itself, and I have
ne desire to labour the point; but in my
humble opinion this is an excessive and
impreper power to give to ail companies
that corne under the Railway Act. While I
think ample provision should be mnadeý for
preper cases, the new language of this rubsection, which is an innovation on the old
law, is toc wide and ton general, and there
is ne limit to the working- of it as against
the interests of commnunities of ail kinds.
A railway might go through the se'ttled part
of a large city, take easements on properties, on buildings. and on interests of a
nature and kind that we cannot at the
moment contemplate.
Hon. Sir JAM-NES LOUGHEED: Could
that not be settled by- compensation?
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: The difficulty
is that when a railway takes an easeient
it is very often of coinparatively small value
to the railway, and yet the railway tics up
and anchors that man's land for aIl lime,
perhaps running a conduit 15 or '20 feet
below the surface. A man in a town nîight
have a few acres of vacant land of commnight
small value, which
paratively
become of great value, but he could not
build on that land, or inake foundations, or
sink, anything. On the other hand, if a wire
is strug 120or 30 feet above a man'., pro-

perty, it i. there for ail 'time, and hie cannot
build on or through that. The issues involved are so important that I would asc
the committee nlot to be in a hurry to paso
this section, but let it be weli considered. I think that possibiy it might
stand over tili sanie
future
date.
Although the évidence In the Commons
committee wiiich, démit with this Bill filled
ini part four volumes, the oniy case that was
thought of or suggested ini support of this
subek-tion wa.s that of t'he Montreal tunnel,
for which special provision ehou.ld be made;
but let us stop there and go siowly btfore we- enact sncb radical legisiation as
this.
Hon. 8fr JALMES LOUGIHEED: 1 wouid
etate to my hononrable friend that this
provis.ion is not entirely nffw, because I
understaxid that this is substantialiy, if
mot preciaely, the language employed in the
* Governiment Expropriation Act, and I believe it is tlie sme as that in the English
Act. We can very well conceive of cases
where it would be very undesirable that a
railway, telegreph or -telephone company
should be compelli te take the freehold,
whlen ail t1hatthey need is eu casernent te go
upon the lond te string their wires, etc.
It seème to me that oould ail bie settled
b7 compensation. If1 the damage in excessive on account of any casernent, there
is provision mode for compensation, and it
seems te me uniikely te be subject te any
abuse, parlficularly as it in surrounded by
ail the safeguairds whieh we have incorpor-_
ated into the Act. I hope my honourable
friend will see bis way te reconcile hlmself to the language whieh we have u8ed.
Hein. Mr. ThELOOURT: To my mind
these definitions are absolutely necessary,
and the Act wili net be susceptible of being
worked out if they- «re nlot included. My
honourable friend ia looking at this matter oniy from the point of view of the railway company wS.nting te exercise an easement; but in order to construct i railway
the eompany may require ta obtain somebody else's servitude or easernent. For instance, a property adjoining mine is one
on which I have a right of way in connection with my property; the railway
company proposes to conatruct its line over
thbat very right of way; At bas acquired
froin the owner the lond on which tlie right
of way exists, and it has also te acquire
fromn me the right te exercise that right
oi way. How are you going ta work out
the Railway Act il you do not include the
words "easernent" and servitude?"
S-181

275

RHon. Mr. MACDONELL: It haî been the
1aw of Canada that raiiway companies
had no right te take casements and servitudes, yet no one has ever complained.
Hon. Mr. BEWJOURT: That in, not the
point.
My ho.nourable friend'a, point i
that we should not disal with -definitiona
of eauements and servitudes. ri so, we
would make it impossible for a railway
company te acquire any casernent or servitude the exercise of whildh would be absolutely necesaary in order te construct the
railway.
Hon. Mr. MAODONELL:. How have railways heretofore canstructed and operated
their roads without this power?
Hon. Mr. BELCOUET: It would only be
confirming the fact te make The -words menu
the use of a right which bas been exercised
!or rnany years past. That would not be
any reason for striking it out; on the contrary, it would be a very good reason for
putting it in. I have givi you a epecific.
case in which the railway company, after
acqniring from the owner of the land the
right of way on which it proposes te build,
has to come te ipe and acquire the servitude.or casernent froin me. Otherwise the
Act is not vorcable.
Hon. Mr. CASGBAIN: I agree entirely
with the honourable member for Toronto
(Hon. Mr- Macdonell) that we should go
slowiy in granting this right of casernent.'
The case cited by the honourable member
fromn Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) doe net
apply ta this case at ail because hie owns
a servitude or easement which hie might
sel te the Genadian Pacifie rat lway or
another rond.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEEP: How
would they get it if they had -flat the
authority te get it?
Han. Mr. CASGRAIN: It fs bard te explain this matter, and I wouid like your
attention for a moment. This is a very
vexed question. We cannot leave these
words, casernent, servitude, etc., under the
pretext that the company is oniy taking an
ordinary easement. What did the Canadia 1
Northern do in Montreal? Starting froin
Dorchester street and' going up College avenue, for instance,' they went underneath
the stree.t. They had te go under the adjoining properties to a very shallow depth
and only took an easexnent. None7 of the
dlaims are settled yet, and they are likely
ta stand ýin that way for years. Later on,

passing under any one's property is no easement. Easement or servitude means that I
make it easy for you to pass over or through
my land; I give you a servitude that you
can pass from place to place; it is a temporary relief. But here is a permanent
structure; it is not a servitude, for they
have a Tight, and you cannot remove Êhem;
they are underneath your property. Un;der
the word "easement"- the Canadian Northern railway bas been expropriating from
Dorchester street,- wbich ila at the south
end of the city, dlean through across the
city and outside of it, without paying anybody up tili now, and there are many cla&ims
for damages of ail sorts oosning against
thom./
I agree with the honourable member for
Toronto that -we should give special value
to the word easement as we find it here,
for it bas given a great deal of trouble, and
has been. argued, about seriously in courts.
There is a case in point-the property of the
Hon. H. B. Rainville. They passed under
his property at a depth of 40 or 50 feet,
ahakinlg the property by blasting, etc,;
but he took out an injunction through
a very able lawyer in ýMontreal; and, as the
whole work would have been tied up
by the injuniction, the oompany gave
for bis property.
him soma $160,000
Being a smat lawyer himnteli and haying enough influence, he managed to
get it, but he was the only one who was
paid for bis property. That was the first
time we beard of any of those easeinents
under the Railway Act, and the people were
taken by surprise. As a practical man, nlot
a lawyer, I submit that if you make a tunnel undér a property, that is flot an easement, because you actually take the property and you have a rigbt t.o it as far
clown 2ncl as h igh up -as you choose to go,
and anybody occupying it permanently has
net merely an easernent.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We are
not saying it i5.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is the application. I acted as arbitrator in a case
where the railway passed under a man's
property at considerable depth, and yet
claimed tbey were only taking an easement. Our man was obliged to leave the
property entirely, on account of the noise
of blasting going on; stili the company sad:
"No, we are not interfering; we are- only
taking- an easement; we are not taking your
Éroperty." I dlaim tbey were taking part
of the property, and I think we should consider that clause very carefully. The word
Hon. Mfr. CASGRAIN.

- servitude" is a sort of French translation for e.asement. I doubt very mucb
whetber it applies entirely. Ever since Confederation railroads have been built under
this Railway Act without the word " easement." The Canadian Pacific railway has
been built, and when it passes under property it aoquires it enirely. .&notber instance is thiat of the Shawinigan Power
Company, which started to take easements
over property for their wires, but they
found in the long run that it would net
woik, and they flnally bad Vo acquire the
ground itaelf. In Ontario you hfave eeveral
electric Uines, anel they do not take easements; but in Montreal tb.ose dangerous
wires, carrying I do not know how many
volts, pass over a property. A pole might
be on a man's lot, and wires strung acroés,
and if those wires broke they would burn
down barns and boeuses; yet the coinpany simply say they bave an easement.
They say the man cannot recover damages; still he has this lightning threatening his house ail the time. I tbink this
House should be very careful about granting powers wtiich would permit companies
permanently to a.cquire property and establish works of this kind. An easement or
servitude may be granted in a case-where
there is a ballast pit, say, three-quarters
of a mile away from a railroad, if the liork
is of a temporary nature. A right of way
to that balaat pit might be acquired for
a certain length of time, alwayq provided
that a reasonable amount was paid for the
land during the time it was in use.
Hon. W. B. ROSSl: I think the hionourable gentleman who bas just resumed his
seat <Hon. Mr. Casgrain) and the honourable gentleman from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Macdonell) both make the saine mistake
in imagining that this definition enables
railroads te get wbat they neyer had befcre. The bonourable member from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Belcourt) has pointed out tbat
there are two sides teo the question. An
easement is just as valuable to tbe owner as
it is to the railroad. If you do net ènlarge
the meaning of the word - land," you will
have a Railway Act that will not be workWithin the last tbree months I

very point, and the definition of land which

will have the third'reading of the Bill deferred for a couple of days in order that,
those who are specially interested may take
communication of the various amendments.
Then the Bill could be amenided on the
third reading, if there were reason Vo make
any further amendment.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE: Oh, no. Let it
go.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, I wish.to express my appreciation of the courtesy, attention, and
interest exhibited by the Committee of the
Whole in 4ealing with this Bill.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN. We are to be congratulatect on having had a good Chairman.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: With*very
great satisfaction I move.that the committee rise and that the Chairman report the
Bill as amended.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I should like to make
just ône observation before the committee
rises, and- that is to express my entire concurrence in what has been said by the honcurable gentleman from De Lanaudiére
(Hon. Mr. Casgrain). I' think that,
although the discussing of this measure in
Committee of the Whole may have been
alitt]e bit trying to gentlemen of our age
and infirmities, still il is better calculated
to give the publie a correct impression of
the sort of 'work that the Senate does than
dealing with the Bill exclusively in one
of the select committees. I think that the
discussion of this Bill and the amendments
that have been made to i. are calculated,
when they reach the eyes of the public, to
inipress then with the idea that the Senate
is not, after ail, a thing whîch exists only
to be abolished.
The Bill was reported with amendments.
On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed.
the amendments were concurred in.
STATISTIOS BILL.
SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of Bill 32, an Act respecting
the Dominion Bureau of Statistics.
He said: This Bill îs very largely a consolidation of the legisiation which -exiets
at the present time on the aubject of statistics. It is intended to -enlarge somewhat
the etope of the department s0 as to cover
branches of statistics into which, up to the

present time, extensive inqulry has flot
been made. When 'the House goda into
comamittee we can discuse the varions
clauses'cf the Bull more particularly than
I care to do at present.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Under section 22
of the Bill, dealing with statistica of trade
and commerce, the Minuster cf Trade and
Commerce wiUl apparently have those
statistics, under bis o'wn hand; but I cbserve that by subsection 2 of that clause it
ia provided: - The Depafîxnent of Oustomns
shahl send to the Dominion Statistician,"
etc. As I understand the malter, the
statistica cf the Department of Trade and
Commerce and those of the Department of
Customs are almoat erattly the isame. It
would appear from thie clause that the
Customs Department us going to issue its
statistes almost entirely separately from
the Department cf Trade and Commerce. It
seema to me that, if there is duplication in
that particular case, It is hardly necessary.
I desire to draw my honourable friend'a attention to this -matter so that he maày be
able to inform us when we go int committee.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The Department cif Custome is the on.ly source
frein which cuStoms sbatistics would be obtainabile. When bhey are forwarded to the
Stabistical Branch cf the Department cf
Trade and Commerce they -may loaeibly
be arranged somewhat difierenbly, but the'
main source of information is the Department of Customs.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.: I do not think my
honourable friend bas c4ughb the point,
but we can discuss it further when -we go
into committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second lime.
YUKON ACT AMENDMENT BILL.
SECOND READING.

Hon Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the

ernment has in mind, if any. Therefore I
regret that the honourable member for Welland (Hon. Mr. Robertson) is not in the
House at the present time. It is a f act that
the United States and Canada entered into
an agreement providing for the interchange
ci agricultural and skilled labour. That has
been published in the official reports issued
by the United States Govern.ment; but I
have flot heretofore seen any reference te it
in any Canadian publications-newspapers
or other records.
The Man-power Bill recently passed will
largely increase the depletion of Canadian
labour avaiuable for. agricultural and industrigl purposes; and, if we are going te
continue what we may cail the essential
industries, those which are necessary for
.Canada's ghsre in the ýpro.secutien of the
war, it ie incumbent upon us to see that we
take advantage, in some form cf the mobilization cf labour end endeavor -te follow
along the lines that hiave been set by the
United States. In tbis regard we are in a
much leas favourable position than the
United States. A very much greater peroentage' cf çur available man-power has
a1réady been reruited, either by voluntary
enliatment or consiption. and we care again
going to draw much more largely on our
man-power. The percentage, of men who
have been withdrawn f rom industrial pursuite ie very much lairger than the percentage thath as been withdrawn fromn sinuilar pureuits ini the United States. Notwithst.anding this fact, and notwithstanding
the advantage that the United States have
over us at the present time ln this regard,
they have coordinated ail their efforts.
Alt.hough. as a rule, when addrewsing this
honoureible House, il dislike to refer te
voluminous notes or te quote from documents, 1 feel it incumbent upon me on this
particular occasiop to refer solely te officiai
documents published by the United States.
I arn sure that this House, and I hope that
in some way the country through the discussion in this House, wiii realize the great
advantage that has accrued te the United
States frorn prepaxedness in this dfirection.
The United States have adopted a plan
which, I regret te say, it net extant here.
They publish a daily officiai -bulletin, vwhether Con.gress às in 8e.gsion or not, which
gives a brief synopsis of every order that is
passed and every action that is taken hy
the Government o! the day. Therefore one
bas only to undertake more or less researchi
in order te ascertain and follow exactly the
progress of events over there. Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS.

As Bo=. as they realized that they were
in the war and that the labour situation
viculd likely become of great. importance.ý
the United States organized what they oalled
the United States Public Service Reserve,
and the following statement le issued by
the Department of Labour in co-o.peration

I have pointed out the first step -taken
was the organization of the United States
Publie Service Reserve. The next step was
the formation of the National War Labour
Board, end 1 want to point Out te you
how successfully they have gone from one
stage' to another until at last they have
coordinated ail their efforts. JI quote &rom
one of the reporte of that board in regard
te the mobilization of labour:
For the puripose of mobilizing the iabour

'Phese agencies should b. given opportuntàty

APRIL 24, 1918
I have -One into this matter pretty
thoroughly. There is a wealth of informnation available in regard not ondly to
ehi-pbiiilding, but also to food production,
coal mining and every other one of wnat
might be called the es.sential industries. I
do flot wish to occupv the tirne of this
House by goiang into too rnuch detail. I
will therefore confine niy remarks to the
question of shipbuilding, with the understanding that the saine methods applied to
that industry àre applicable to every other
industry, essential or non-essential.
The War Labour Board having arranged
to, anobilize the labour supply, it became
necessary to take sorne action in regard to
the adjustrnent of the wagea that the labouters; should receive. Otherwise the mere
fact of their havîng mobilized a large and
effective force of men willing to work in
essential industries might have caused far
greater confusion, because each particular
plant or each particular place to which
the men xnig.ht be assigned wvould arrive at
a different basis of reniuneration. So the
next step was the organization of a Labour
Adjustment Board. In this connectiont I
tel et to t.he Shipbuilding Labour Adjustment Board. It arranged a &chedule of
wages, wvhich %vas flot unifo-m, but was so
adjusted as to be equitable for every section. of the countrv frorn the Atlantic to
the Pacific; and, in is--uinz their reports
as to the ternis that would be accepted.
by the emplovers a.nd the wvages paid to
enip'oyees, they included this paragraph

The United States Shipping Board cails upon
the State and-local counicils of defence to aid
the United States Publie Service Reserve in

volunteers.
'Your State must raise its quota

Your State

are.
The actual enroliment is to be performed by
the agencies of the United States Public Service

but the United States Shipping Board relies
upon the State and local counicils of defence to

other essentials is g-reater to-day than it
was even a year 4ago; and who knows, if
we are backward in 'well doing, but that
by the time we are well organized. and our
labour and industrial organizations are coordinated we rnay be too late? Perhaps the
registration which is to take place in June
inay bring about some appreciable me-asure of success in this direction; therefore
1 have taken this opportunity of drawing
the attention of this honourable House to
this matter. I shall be very glad indeed, es
I arn sure this, House wil be, to receive
any information in regard to what measures are being taken by the Go'vernment
along these lines.
Hon. GIDEON ROBERTSON: Honourable gentlemen, I deep]y regret having been
absent during the last hali-hour, because I
wanted particularly to be present to hear
the remarks of the honourable gentleman
who hag itist taken bis seat. I was unavoidably detained by import~ant work in connection with the Canada Registration Board.
Some gentlemen from outside of te city
-who had to leave early this afternoon came
in on the noon train, and I c.ould not consistently decline Vo nieet thera. I make
this explanation in the hope that you wil
realize, honourable gentlemen, that it was
because of necessity in dealing with this
important question that 1 was absent, and
not because of any p:ersonal inclination.
It is extremely difficult for me to attempt
to reply to the honourable gentleman from
Toronto, flot having heard ail that lie said;
but I t.ake it that his reinarks generally had
to d-o with the labour situation in Canada,
and what arrang-ements IWve been made
bet.ween our Governînient ed the Government of the United St.ates %vith reterence
to the interchange of workmen, and what
our locý-al situation is with referencte to
present aud prospective supplies and demiands for labour.
.
lun anzwer to the lioxouraîrle ffentleiiiî a n
first qjuestion, I mnay say: a n arr'angemen-it
iS in effect between thie United Statez Department of Labour aud the D.epartnment of
Immigration and Golonization for tbe interchbauge of agricultural workers."
In titis conection 1 ntav siaîe ilhat 1 bial
the honour and pleasure of being a
parly to that agreement between the two
Governments. 1 accom.panied the gentlemen
from the Departinent of Immigration and
Colonizattion who reacited te understanding. As a resuit of our visit to Washington,
an agreement somewliat in the formi of a
trealv wvas reached between ibe two Gov-

APRIL 24, 1918
ernments, whereby we were to receive, and
we have already received, se6eral thousand
v.farm labourers who have gone into the
Canadian Weet. They wil¶ help on the land
and will very materially increase the
acreage of grain sown iii' the West this
year.
The answer to question No. 2 is: "'The
urne arrangement covers tihe exechange of
skilled workers." There is a sliglit restriction in regard to that. Skililed labourers
ean only be exchanged between the two
* countries when each. Government has been
eatisfied that the- workmen -cannot be
obtained in the country where they are
required. If there are eoeployers in tihe
United States who deaire to wilthdr.aw a
large numlýer of skiiled labourers from this
country, .they cannot dlo 80 if the labour
can be obtained in their own country, and
tbey cannot do so even then without the
-consent
of our Governent, and vice versa.
The answer to question No. 3 is: "'The
terme of the arrangement are set out in the
attached copies of a reciprocal agreement
mode at Waahington on January 25, 1918."
The answer to question No. 41se: "The prospective employer in the United States eatisfies himself as to the qualifications of any
labourer hie wishes to imiport fîren Canada,
and similarly, the Canadian employer satisfies himself as to the qualifications of sny
labourer to be importied fromn the United
.States. Vie United States Department of
Labour on the one hand, and the <Department of Immigration and Colonization on
the other, decide on whetiher auch labour
should be allowed te leave one or other of
the respective countries, as well as decide
on whether such labour should be allowed
to enter."
The answer to question No. 5i is: "It is
impossible tc 6ay at this date how far the
man pQwer registration will <be used to govern this, exýchange of labour but undoubtedly it will Ibe of value in detoerxnining',what
class and arnount of laboufr shal <be allowed
tc leave Canada, and what clans and amount
ef labour it will be found necesssry te import."
As it may be interesting to honourable
gentlemen, I will take this occasion of
niakîng a brief reference to thie undertaking of the Governanent in connection
with the inventory of the - nan-power of
Canada.
I think the Honourable Mr.
McCurdy, who is a member of tihe Canada
Regi stration Board, made an announcement
or a public comment in tihe other House
a day or two ago in regard to this same matter. If the House will bear with me, I
will try. to give a little information in

285

regard to the work of thes Board. As
honourable gentlemen no doubt realise, it
is no small undertaking to attempt te
arrange an organisation for the registration
of approximately 5,000,000 in one day.
Nevertihelesa we are preparing an organisation for that purpose. The work is well
under way, and I anticipate th<at some time
in June-the date will be decided upon
as far in advance as possible-we shaîllask
every resident of Canada over the age 'of
sixteen years to appear at one of the places
appointed and fill out a registration card,
when lie or se will receive in return a
registration certifloate signed by the Deputy
Registrar, which will be the certifloate of
identification for tise holder, andwhicis
will indicate tc ail inquirers that he or Éie
han been duly registered.
I will not weory the House by going
into the details of the reasons tisat pronspted
the Government tc undertake tii registration, further than te" say tihat it je being
done with the hearty co-operation and
approval of almost aIl the interests in,
volved. For months past varieus interesta
in Canada have been pointing out tisat
there was a very serious scarcity of labour
in this country; on the other hand, other
interests, labour intereste in particular,
have held to the view that while there
wss a scarcity of labour in some places
there wos a surplus in others, and that
if labour were equitaibly distributed tisroughout the country tihe supply would meet tise
demand. After a conference, 'which was
held in January, between enembers of the
Governmentand -a large delegation of labour
men, numbering some fifty-five, it was
igreed tisat labour would cooperate with
the Government in taking steps to ascertain
as a business proposition whether or not
there was -a real ehortage of labour in
this country. The position taken by the
labour men was that if tihere was a shortage
it would have to be admitted, but if there
was not they would assist and cooperate
with tihe Govern-ment in directing tise available labour irito the channels where iA
could be most usefully employed. The
brief investigations tihat we have been
able to make thus far indicate Abhat tihere
are a great many men in this country who
are engaged at their chosen occupation for
only a portion ef the year. We hope to be
able to assist tihese men in obtaînîng ensployment in useful industriee during other
portions of the year, perhaps in localities
somewîhat distant fromn where they reside.
By reason of such distande they were not
able individually te find employment,
though they might have done so through

286

SENÂTE

assistance such- as that eug.
gested.
The ultimate objeet of the registration
system is to bring to the door of the employer of labour the workmen he requires,
and to obtain for the workman who is out
of employment the opportunity of employment, so that tbhe utmost efficiency and the
greatest production may resuit from the
number of workrnen available. Inasmuch
as the labour men themselves, as well as
the employers of labour, and I believe aur
rpeople
generally throughout the country,
are aIl in hearty accord with this plan, and
rbelieve
thie is the proper thing ta do, perhape the only proper criticisim that might
rb.
levelled at it is that the work ought
ta have been undertaken a littie earlier.
Every bonourable gentleman, if he agrees
with what I have said, can rendes useful
assistance to the Board of Registration,
which has been offered the cooperation of
fraternal, labour, women's and other organizatians, municipal associations and
provincial governiments. In nome instances
public achool. buildings have been placed
at the disposaI of the board for registration purpoaes. I trust th-at every honourgentleman will impress upon the people
rable
within the district whieh, he represents,
as h. meets tbem, the importance of ail
what they cau ta make the registra-doing
tion plan a success. If every person in
Canada over sixteen years of age will register, so that the record may be complete, we
can niake valuable use oi it, and.give very
material assistance ta workmen, to eniployers of labour, and to our citizens generaily, and perform a service which -will
be ta the future advantage of îndustry in
this country. I desire to express the hope
that everybody 'will feel that the purposes
behind the taking- of this reg-istration are
absolutely laudable and in the best interests of aur people as a whole.
I presume the honourable member from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Nicholîs) has -made
sanie reference ta the situation in sanie of
our large industries emrploying great nunibers of men, such as the mining and shipbuilding industries.
Sinoe the war broke out there have
not been any industrial dispute., causing
I may
a cessation ol railro.ad. traffic.
perhaps be pardoned lor oalling the
attention of the House to this particular fact, that about 170,000 employees
of aIl sorts on our Ca.nadian railways
--that is the -estimate made by the
general manager of one of our large rmadls,
and not my own figures-have worked loyal]y hand in hand ta keep the transportation

rsystematic

lion. Mr. ROBERTSON.

business of this country going s.moothly, regardless of the fact that in many instances
the increased compensation granted by the
railways bas not altogether met their necessities. I desire ta say further that it is very
largely due ta the fair consideratian tkxat
aur Canadian railways have given to the
needs of their employeea that friction has
been avo'ided iiithe railway world sinee the
wer becan.
In the mining industry there has been
sanie difficulty; but at the pres'ent time,
s0 far as my knowledge goes, there is very
little fear of serions industriaI strife during
the present year. I thirik that the arrangement the. Goverument has mnade in the western coal fields, in what is commonly known
as District 18, has 'worked very well. 1
have had sme personal. experience during the past few nsantkis in deaixg with
the question of wages and rwarking conditions for a nuniber of thousands ci minersin the province of Nova Scotia, and desire
ta pay m.y respect.ul admiration of the loyal
position which tbey took. They made very
sericus personal aacri-fices te meet thse urgent request that wasmsade ta them ta do
nothing at this time that would tie up the
coal mines or ¶he t-ranaportation of necesaary war supplies. On the. other hand,
their esuployers very materially improved
their compensation ansd rates of pay, but
not nearly te the extent that the men had
hcsped for, or in my opinion merite1, under.
the circunistances.
In the shipbuilding industry there have
been prospects of difficulty, due to the continued abnormal increase in the oost af
everything tise workman bas ta purchase
in order ta live anid maintain bis family.
The. shipbiuilding industry is peculiar, inasuuch as -most of the work is done by
cantract, and whe.n a shipbuilder takes a
contract at a certain rate hie bases it upon
the accepted cost of labour and material;
but those costs have been rising rapidly,
and no doubt the shipbuilder bas been encountering rnany difficulties. However, the
Minister of Marine, 'who bas jurisdiction
in this matter, bas taken such action that
the prospect of trouble has been very largely
removed, and within the'past few 'weeks
at
understandings have been arrived
witb respect ta conditions of emiplayment
and rates of pay for many men engaged -in
the shipbiuilding industry in the Great
Lakes area which I tbdnk wlRl very-largely
eliminate the poesibility, or at least the
probabiIity, of any industrial strife arising
in t.hat important field of industry during
the present year.

APRIL 24, 1918
Hon. Mr. BOSTOC K: -Does that eirtend
ta the Pacifie coast P
Bon. Mr. ROBERtSON: My inf ormation
with -respect ta the Pacifie coast situation
is that a commission of inquiry was
appointed. by the -Gavernment a short time
ago and is now i.nvestigatiug the particular
question that lias arisen there. The Minister of Labour has that matter in charge,
snd it is progressing satisfactorily, and I
a.nticipate that a satisiactory solution wifl
b. reached.
As to the steel industry, dnring the past
few years in the province of Nova Scatia
a very important induetry in the production
of iron and steel has devloped; thousanda
af men are employed, the number having
increased ta probably more than double
since the war broke ont. Saine difficulty
arase there flot long aga with reference
ta the recognition of the rights of the cmplayees ta organise. -Honourable gentlemen
knaw that this lias been a vexed question
throughout this cauntry, indeed over the
whole af Niorth America, for years past;
but it is gradus.ily becaming leas and lesa
serions, becanse not only aur Goverument
but that of the United Statee bas for years
recagnized as a general principle the right
of workmen ta belang ta any arganizatian
af their choie which governe the v)articular
clasa of business in which they may be
engaged. As long ago as 1907 aur Industrial
Disputes Investigation Act was--passed,
clearly implying auch recognition an the
part ad the Dominion Government, which
supplied, through the Act, the machinery
and proper meaus for adjusting-dkzputes
when representatives cf employeca failed ta
reach an agreement with their employers.
This question became somewhat sente in
the steel works in the province cf Nova
Scotia, approachiug the breaking point as
between the employers and employees, and
I think the men withdrew their services
f or twenty-four hours. However, the assurance by the Government that the nmen
would get a square deal, and that they
would immediately appoint a-commission
ta make inquiry, which they did, induced
the men to return to Work, aud the matter
is now under investigation by the commission, sud I anticipate that the whole trouble
will be adjusted satisfactorily without any
interruption af -business.
Hon. Mr. MeS WEENEY: Is that the

s0 there is only one organization ta deal
with there naw.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May.I correct
my bonourable friend ini that impression?
What is known as the P.W.A., ar the Prowhieh
vincial Workmen's Association,
existcd among the minera in Nova Scotia
some years ago, and the United Mi-ne
Workffs' organisation. whieh came inta

tigation conducted by a Royail Commission
appointed, by the Government. That Commission sncceeded. in getting .the two conflicting organisations inta what is knowun
as the Amalkamated Mine Workers of Nova
Scotia; but that organization is -separate and
distinct sud in no way a part of the organi-4twon ta whieh my honourable friend

Hon. [Mr. ROBERTISON- While it is true

work man in Canada is less that it was four
years ago. Yet, in spite of that situation,
the workmen throughout this country,
taking them. as a whole, have absolutely
stood by their work, when under normal
conditions they would not have done so,
because of their desire to assist the Government -and the. country in prosecuting
its war efforts ta the utmxost, ta make production of every sort as great as possible,
and to îhelp in every way ini the effcient
ecÏrrying an af the war. I trust that that
attitude is appreciated.
Han. Mr. DANDURAND: The honour-'
able gentleman -las spoken oi this registration as a help towards lmproving labour
conditions. Ca.uld he give us an idea of
the working plan of the Government for
the enipicyment of people in our cities who
are not in the labour-ing class, and yet who
will be registered, tram 16 up to 60' 1
refer to clerks, members of the liberal pro-'
fessions, and other civilians in cities, who
are wonde'ring what their dutie-s will be
and what will be expected of them.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I reply ta
my honourable friend iby making a littie
further explanati 1ýnP I om-itted to state
that representatives of the labour organizaliions who had a conference with tihe Gevernment in January promised ta endeavour
ta obtain as f ax as possible the voluntary
offer of -workmn throughout Canada, ta
meet the requirements. For instance, if a
hundred men were reqnired in the shipbuilding industry in sanie particular yard,
the labolur organizations concerned would
undertake -ta obtain that labour. Furthermare, it is proposed that the needs af eniployers will be made known ta *every coinniunity through any organization with
which it is passible ta cammunioate; and
I think hanourable gentlemen are aware
that legcislation is pending- which it is contemplated will encourage the formation and
maintenance of labour bureaus by the provincial g-overnments, and that financial assistance ta that end is being affered by the
Dominion Government. If the provincial
governments throughaut Canada wsill estab.
lish provincial labour bureaus, the infarmation that will be gathered. in this registration can (be cammunicated ta liheni,
and if in any province there ma:y be a surplus of labour of any sort it can be distributed ta another province where it may
be required. As an illustration that came
ta aur notice a 'few days -ago, I may paint
out that tihere are several thousand niiners
short in the province o! Nova Scatia, yet
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

there are many tinineTs in other provinces
who, tempararily at lea.st, are net being
etuplayed: If it can be arranged by sanie
systematic effort that each prôvincial. bureau can be kept in touch with what la-bour
is available, or can repart its requirements
ta sanie central body, we hope, by means
ai the information we callect, ta be af much
assistance te those pro4vincial organizstions,
or such others as may be created by municipalities for similar purpases, or any
others, no. matter of w'hat sort, that may
inquire for information.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The question
I put ta my honourable friend did net caver
the labour, world; A~ referred te the niany
thousanda af people dwelfing in cities who
are nat in the labouring classes, and yet
who will be registered, and who are wonderîng what will be expected of them or what
will be done with thema. Throughout the
whole Dominion city and town people as
well as country people will be registered,
and I aimply put the question, which has
accurred -te me by examining the different
forms which. have rea.ched me, what will
b. expected of the pei4e who are not
among the labouring element and who can
dispose o! sorne timeP
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think the
snswer te my honourable friend's question
is that in the questionnaire there is oe
specific, question-I think it is No. 12--put
te every persan who registers: "Will your
circumatances permit you ta leave yaur
present work and go elsewhere on national
service?'"-er wards ta that effect. Any
resident af this country, no matter what

af which my hanaurable friend speaks.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Will my honourabie
friend say whether registration has taken
place in the United States such as that ai
which he speaks in this country?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Iu the United
States a complete registration, much. more
detailed than is proposed ta ha taken here,
has been carried out Iby certain States,
but not as a Federal undertaking, I believe.
Plhe state af New York, for example, recently
took a very comprehensive registration,
even ta the number ai pigs, calves, cattle
and horses, and the number ai bushels of
grain that each. persan h-ad raised in the

APRIL 24. 1918
previous ye-ar. I do not think registration
has yet -been made a Federal undertaking
in the United States.
Hon. Mr. DAVID. if I nderstand correctly what the honourable gentleman has
stiated, there will be only one day for the
registration. How will it be carried out
in regiens only lately opened for settiement,
where people would have to travel twenty
or thirty miles te reach the place of registration? I suppose there will be a bureau
which will be open only during the registration day.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It is not anticipated that any person will have to travel
a great distanoe to regieter. The plan
adopted is that there will be places of
registration .provided within the same
districts as polling places were provided
for at the st Dominion election. The
,area of the polling subdivision will be
that of the registration subdivision. So I
thînk it will be possible for nearly every
person to reach the registration place on
the appointed day. It is intended under
the regulations to provide that the houri;
of registration shahl be from 7 o'clock in
the morning until 10 at night. That will
give every person an opportunity to register
at sorne time within those heurs. If for
any good reason -a person is unable to deposit his registration card on the appointed
day and re-ceive his certificat-because hie
is confined to bed. by illness, or absent
from the country, or any such reason-it
is permissibie for him to register at the
post office within thirty days êfter registration dey; but a reasonable excuse must
be offered for failîng to register on registration day itself.
One furthber remark may be of interest.
Any person imay register at any registration
place, regardless of whether that is his place
of residence or not. Any honourable gentlemen who may happen to ha- in Toronto on
registration day can deposit his card in
Toronto and receive bis certificate just as
if hie were at his own place of residence.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Honourable gentlemen, the minister (Hon. Mr. Rober.tson)

Toronto spokie particulariy with reference
te shipbuiiding, and there ia ne doubt that
there must be shiphuiiding in this ceuntry
and aUl over the wordd, because, we are
serry te admit, the submarines are sinking
more tonnage than is being huilt in the
wheole warid. I think they are sinking
about twe tons for every tan that is heing
produced throughiout the world, and if the
present rate of lasses continues liong the
situation wii become very serious. There
is no doubt that Canada must have shipbuilding and that the United States require
a tremendous amount of tonnage in erder
te keep. net a very great number ot men,
say a million men en the other side. That
requires ail the available tonnage to-day.
It requires five tons per year te keep ene
man on the ot.her side, with food, ammunitien, etc. That shows how many shipa are
required, and the United States have net
enoughi ships. Se I take issue witli the
lionourable gentleman tram Tenante as te
the desirability et imitating the United
States. I sincerely hope, and I helieve,
that we shail proportionately do better than
tha United States. The honourable gentlemian fromi Tarante told us that the United

registration cards, food economy registratien cards, and se on, and when we are
asked, -What does this ina? we are

Two questions have been .put by the
honourable gentleman from Mille Ilefs (Hon.
Mr. David) wlîich ought te be answered
more plainly, se that the regaistratien of

The hionourable gentlemnan asked if everyoaýe would have te go te the polling booth
to register, or whether the head of a family
could not register for t-he whole family.
The answer lias been given that everyone
froni sixteeni te sixty will -have to go te
the polling booth -and register-it would
be the saine as an election.
If there are twe hundred electeors in an
electoral subdivîiin it would be impossible
for ail the people in tlîat district to register. WIiv? Because at an election only
r
two lîuidred peofflé have to, .. te the

each person registering. How is it possible
to do that in one day? I understand that
the registration centres wvill be open froin
eight o'clock in the morning until ten
o'clock at night. Even so, it would be
impossible te register one thousand men
and to answer ail the questions which
vill be asked by thein. WVould it flot be
better te carry eut the suggestion made
by the honourable gentleman from Mille
les and allow the head of the family to
register? He could make an affidavit gîving the required information about himself,
his wife, his sons and his daughters, and
Under
that would end the wvhole iatter.
that method thiere would be only two hundred men going te the registration office
instead of a thousand, and -the registration
would be more easily and more correctly
done. In addition to that, you have to
consider the menib)ers of the family. Very
soon it will be seeding-timie, and the
farmer will have to hitch up his horse
te drive his wife and his sons and daughters to one of these regýistratin places.
They wvill probably spend a wvhole day in
making the journey; se it will be net only
in practicable, but practically impossible,
te carry out the registr.ation in this way.
I understand that t.he registration la te
take place on a certain day. If one of the
nembers of the familv is sick, wliat tiien?
Jf the hesd of the fanîily registered for
the whole fanîily, lie would lie able te
answer for the fainily, and if anyone were
sick, he could produce a certificate from
the family docter te thlat effect. If this is
done, time and trouble wvill be savcd, and
the registration will l)e carricd out just as
well or better than if every nmeiber of t-be
family had te register.
I understand that there will be as inany
as twelve questions asked of a person
registering, because the honourable gentlemani has said that the twelfthi question
would be answered in suchi and such a way.
The greater the number of questions to be
answered the longer it will take for the
family te register. .1 think the honourable
gentleman ought ta consider-this point and
aniend the cards se as te overcomne thîs
difficu]ty.
De LoriThe honourable gentleman fri
mier (Hon. MAr. Dsandurand) lias askzed a
very proper question, and it seemns to me
that the honourable gent(leinan froni Welland (Hon. Mr. Robert.sen) lias evaded it.
Though he is very clever and spoke very
weIl, I understand that ho cannot on the
spur of the moment answer that question.

of labour to-day. I think that in every
part of Canada there is a very great dearth
of labour in every department of our nndertskings. A suggestion vas ruade in another place a few days ago that a very
large number of men might be taken from
one of the provinces of the Dominion to
the province of British Columbia for lumbering operations!* That woùld be ail very
well for the lumbering indnstry of British
Columbia, but it w'ould certainly be very
detrimental to the lumberers of the eastern
portion of Canada, because il there is any
industry in which there in À dearth of

I amn a lumberman, and while it is not important ta the Empire or ta Canada
*whether I succeed in may undertakings, it
i. important ta Canada and the Empire
that vis should havé sufficient lumber as well

of this var. As everyone knows, the first
requisite is food, and the next is clothing,
but I amn afraid there is going ta be a shortage of both.; andI arn very sorry ta say

with 'those exceptions there is very little. I
am perfectly convlnced'. that this country
will raise a billion bu.shels ai wheut in the
future. In 1883 w. ghipped aur flrst wheat ta
Europe; in 1915 we -ralsed 350,000,000 ibushels
and we had 200,000,000 bushels. shipped ta
Europe. Il my advice given ta the Hanse
st yeax bad been taken, we wauld have
rai.sed mare wheat this, year than 'will b.
ralsed. I prapoged. that -we ehould put tractian angines on the prairie, sud that we
ehould ean.vaa every farmer and find how
much mare land ha cauld sow; 'but nothing
was doue. However, the f armers themselves obtaineal traction engines, which they
were auble ta do because they have been «etting a very large revenue froin production,

crops. In Alberta last year the traction
engin. was going 24 houre a day, with threa
shifts of eig4ht hours each, and the acreage
lu our Northwest this year -will. be increased
by 10 per cent in the whole, snd in some
places tby 20 per cent. I would noV have
gone into these figures but for the rem.arks
ai the hon-ourable isenator from Rideau
about Vhs country, ta 'whioh I take exception, and I thought I would state =y 6ide
af the question.
Hon. Mr. EDWARDS: Might I just add
eue word, nat for tihe purpoee of combatting
rny hanourable friend, but to correct a
stateinent which he mrade. I was at a large
convention of lumbermen lu New York a
few days ago, and hadi an opportuuity af
discussing conditions in the West, East end
South, and 1 discovered that in Canada we
wera paying very much higher 'wages than
they were in any part o! the United States.
Hon. Mr. RICHARDSON.

Hon. Mr. DAVID: Will the honaurable
gentleman fro'm Kingston (Han. Mr. Richardson) answer thia question: how does
he explain the statement in newspapers
that 90,000 people axe needed' from the
easteru prouinces, of Canada ta assist the
farmers of the western provinces?
Han. Mr. POPE: Does not the honourable gentleman know that -a large numxber
of people wanteé ta «et out of our provinces last year, and, went iuta the United
States and worked iu the woodG in order ta
save their necks from conscription?
tHon. Mr. DOMVILLE: This debate tends
ta create -the impressin that we cannot
build ahipe in New Brunswick because we
cannot «et labour. Now, all 'we want is
the judicicue help of, the Governîmnt,
which niy honouralble frieud bas said will
b. given. We have akilled shipbuilders
in New Brunswick, and we eau increase
the num!ýber, and eau train others 'with very
lit.tle difficulty; but the people vaut ta
understand in what position they will be
placed. by the lestering hand of the Governinent 60 that they may b. able ta get
capital ta carry on this 'work; that is al
that ia holding Lhem 1baok. Il we could. get,
a friendly expression of thie Houee and
of t~he Goverument that they are going ta
look ahead and see ho* they can develap
Canada, then our part will be doue. Years
aga New Brunswick was the largest place
for èhipbuildiug in the world. The industry
fell off then because there was na place
ta develop the iran aud steel for girders;
but that industry bas now been developed
in Nova Scotia so, that in various places in
the Maritime Provinces we can assemble
and put ta«'ether what the steel plants create.
I was very much pleased with the remarks
af the Minister w.hen he said we waut ta
look aut for the future and net sit down
aud say we have got nothing. That is, the
kind of impression we need ta seud broadcast over this tountry: we must give the
peaple hope. I would like the Minister ta
give us same littie outline ai what further
aid is ta be given ta this industry, and
we will take care of aur end of it, for we
can build ships with any people in the
world. Nova Scotia eau produce the iran
aud steel, aud we cau -have aur ,rolling
miii bend it, aud eau put it -togetJher.
Where I came lrom everybady is willing ta
lend a hand, barring a few politîcians who
are struggling for place-more heads than
helmets; but we must net listen ta them

~Mr.

O'Connor must make way for the Minister. of Labour, 1 fancy.
Hon. Mfr. ROBERTlSON- With reference
te the remarks ei my honourable friend
from Portage la Prairie (Hon. Mr. Watson),
I can state truthfully, having somè definite
knowledge oft what occurred, that the Minister of Labour did not interfere with the
business of Mfr. O'Connor.
Hon. 1fr. WATSON: We know frorn the
public press that Mfr. «~oxmor sitated that
the minister d'id interfere, and that is one
resen which Mr. O'Connor gives-that he
was not permitted te, manage his own staff.

in his correspondlence. Anybody who wants
to read between. the lines wvill know that.
Anyhow, the point I rais i this, that Mr.
Crothers has interfered in a matter here in
tihe city of Ottawa, whioh hie had no right
to interfere in, according to the dzctrine
laid down by the honourable gentleman
representing the labour 'interests in the
Oabinat.
Hon. Mr. POWER:- With respect te the
case of Mr. O'Connor-I know I amn out of
order, but Iperhaps yeu will pardon me for.
a moment-I think that Mr. O'Connor was
a very geod public servant. He discharged
hie duties adrnirably. He collected a goed
deal of valuable- information, *and put
before the people of this country the exact
situation with respect to food supply. But
I cannot say that 1 feel that the withdrawaq
cf Mi. O'Connor from the position that he
occupied ie a very serions loss to the
country, because, although Mr. O'Connor
made these investigations and made these
admirable reports, the Governrnent neyer
took any -actionh whatever en any of his
reports. What in the use of keeping a
valuable officer hard at work if yeu do not
make somes use of the product cf his workP

Hen. Mr. ROBERTSON: The staff was al
attached te the Departrnent of Labour, and,
unless the minister of a department has
suprerne and final juriadiction in contrebing
the affaire of his department, the business
cannet be carried, on. Any honourable
gentleman must .be aware of that. If a
subordinate efficer in any department will
net be subservient te, or have respect for,
the visihes or deocisiens of the head of the
department, and they corne into confliet.

this Bill il hie has any figures *as ta the
number of employees that will be necessary by reason of the establishment ai this
department.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON- It is impossible
ta give any accurs4e estimate. At the
presentt time it would be 'jmrely a~ guess,
because cd! the fact that no one can foresee
wiat the luture has in~ store. The 'answer
ta the question depends very much on how'
long the war continues, and how rnany -of
cur gallent 'boys who eventnaiiy corne homea
will be disabled and maimed and will have
to corne under the care, supervision and
direction of this departrnt.

As I then stated, there are new about 4,000
returned mien taking advantage ai vocatiional training, and about 3,000 in lihose
bornes which are at present under the administration ai lthe Departoment, oi Soldiers'
Civil Re-esta'blishment. That nuinher will
increase,.not only as the war prooeeds, but
as aur forces are Teturned ta Canada. At
the present Urne there are, i the hospitals
acdGreat Britain and France, 1 think aver
20,000 men who have suiffered frorn casualties ai different kinds. A fairly large proportion ai these men will necessariiy be
cared for in the hornes caming under this
department. There will be a corresponding
increase in vocational training. Ths.t, ai
course, will be governed by the nuniber of
disabied men returning ta Canada.
Upon demobilization taking place, the
cast af Vhis department will be very largely
governed by the question ai enpioyrnent.
If emplayment for aur dernobilized men
shall be easily secured, the cost wili be
very rnuch less; but if we flU upon tirnes
when the Governrnent will have ta make
very special efforts ta oeanre or ta provide
ernpiayrent for these tien, the coot of the
departinent will iho increased. correspondingiy. The department will take aver the
work ai the ald Hospitals Commission, with
the exception ai that portion afi t which
has passed ta the Departmnent ai Miiitia.

its business with the- Gývernment through

Hou. M.r. BOSTOCK: I under.stand-that
this departrnent is reaily taking over the
work done by the Military Hospitais, Cosmission. I suppose that a large number -of
the staff of the Milîtary Hoopitala Comnmission will norw be transi erred ta this
depaiitment. My honourable iiriiend <Han.
Sir James Lougheed) the other day stated,
I think, that as soon s the men were discharged f rom rnilitary service they would
corne under 1this departrnent, but that as
long es they were under rnilitary discipline
they would be under the Mii ia Department. Therefare I eresume that the whoie
organization oi the Milits.ry Hospitals Catimission is gaing ta be dilvided, part going
ta the Militia Departrnent and the rest ta

ÏPUBLIG WORK8 AMT -4NDMENT

CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE.

-On motion of Hon. Mr. Robertsoni, the.
Sonate went into committee on Bill 40,
an Act ta amend the Public Works Act.
Hon. Mr. Poeter in the. Ohaïr.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I would ask whether
this Bill ahould nut provide for compensation in case of invasion of rights or property fram the.carrying on oi public works, and
would, sueet the following clause:
If In the carrying out of any auch works the
rlghts or property of any province or person are
Invaded, due compensation shall be made and
paid. and the amount thereaf shall be deterniined as provided In chapter 143 of the Revined
StatutAs of Canada. 1906.

It would be by the Exciiequer Court,. as

private rights sud private property.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Has my
honourable friend looked. into the Public
Works Act to ascertain whether pro'vision
has not already been made for paymnent
o! compensation? It seems ta mie that there
muet ho a -provision in the machinery we
have for entering on p5roperty.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: No, the"e ie not.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It seems
ito me th.at compensation ehould: be paid
if damages are suffered by the owner oi any
private property, and there muet ho saine
general provision for that.
-Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I do not think there
is.

Hon. Mr. GORDON: I arn very gl.ad that
this amendmnent has been 'euggeeted, because the departmnent hbas always acted as
having this power already.

302

SENÂTE

Hon. Sir JAMES LOU GHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Whenever the Government requires te take any property under the Act respecting expropriation of
laMn, the machinery for compensation is
provided in chapter 143, and there is nothing to cover a case of that kind in the
Public Works Kct.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Would not the bed
of the river be land?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: No. The Privy
Counicil decided that the province owns.
the bed of the river, but the Federal Parliament bas t.he right to use the be of the
river for the purpose. ef improving navigation; se that such a case -would not cali
for compensation, as At would be the exercise of the Federal right. But there may
and will be cases where the <ievernment
under this Act may affect private preperty,
or poesibly even property belonging te a
province. If in carrying out their works
thejy invade any 'private or provincial right
-they
should pay for it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If my
honourable friend wil hand in that amendnment as a notice, I sha'll ask that the conimittee rise, and we will give every conuideration to it.

CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT BILLREVISION 0F PUNISHMENTS.

Appeal. I would therefore meve that thp
clause be changed to read as follows:
whefl an offender has been convicted of an
lndictabie offence other than one punishable with
death. the Attorney Generai of the province In
which the conviction was had may direct that
application rnay be made to the Court of Appeal
for the province for the revision of the sentence
passed.

Hlon. Mr. CHOQUETTE: 1 think it is
only fair that the attorneys general of the
provinces should have the right that the
amendmen# proposes, but I would go lu-ther. Prom my experience in Quebec I
think we ought te give more authority te
the Attorney General, and relieve the Minjeter of Justice of detaile which can be
better settied by the officiais of each province than by the Minister of Justice himself. Therefore I wouid suggest etili further
to amend this clause by eaying that the
Attorney General, upon the application of
the party so condemned. wiIl have the
same authority in regard to remiesion or
mitigation of hise entence as the Minister
of Justice, or that it can be done on bis
recommendation. The Minister of Justice
may stili take un appeal froni the sentence.
Not only that, but I do not eee why the
Attorney Generai of a province, who knowe
by bis officers ail about the triai, shouid
net be, in a better position than the Minister of Justice te remit or mitigate or
reduce a sentence.

against a littie girl, and there was.quite an
uproar in thie province about iL. Within two
or three months another man -was convicted
on a similar charge, and I arn informed and
believe tb.at the circumstances surreunding
bis case were in hie favour rather than in
the other. yet he was sentenced te penitentiary for seven years. Probably that was a
just punishment, but if so w.hat about the
man who gel ouly six months? This Bill
provides that in such a eaue as that, if the
Attorney General -is net satis-fied, bis. officers
can make a report to him, and if be flnds
there has been a great miscarriage cf justice, he aimply issues his fiat on behaif cf
the prisener, and the four or five judges
who coustitate the Court of Appoal, aiLer
reviewing the circumstances, can correct
that error. I would net go any further than
that at present. I do~ net se how my
honourabie friend could think for a moment
cf introducing an aemendmrent giving the
Attorney General cf a province pc>wer ta
remit or reduce a sentence on bis own initiative. I would certainly oppose such an
amendling clause. I do not thinik il wonid
be f air to the Ateorney' General, as there is
aiways a door open fer the play' of politics
in a matter of th.at kiud. In this case it
goes before the judges af the Court of Appeal. and is net open ta the play cf politica,.
,or f avouritism, or anything of that kind.
Hon. Mr. OHOQUETTE: I quite agree
with the amendmnt ci the honourable
gentleman and support it, but I go further.
I would add ta the authority the fiat cf
the Atteoney General cf each province, and
give him the same righit as the Minister of
Justice te give- a ticket of leave te a prisoner.
Hon. MT. MeMEANS: I do net think
that would be constituticinal.
Hon. Mir. CROQUETTE: Yes, I t.hink iL
wesild. 1 ceuld cite hundreds of cases in
which the Minister of Justice ha been
bothered with sinall matters, sucli as the
reporting on sentences, giving tickets cf
leave, and'pardoning. For example, aome
peeple are brought, befoTe me, and I condemun them. te j ail or peuitertiary; and the
Minister of Justice neyer remits a sentence,
neyer gives a ticket~ of leave, for*dees anythiing with any of those pirsoners 'without
asking me for a report. Very o~ften I report in lavour cd the prisener, and about
tbe time his -sentence bas expired by bis
good conduct or by the goed report of thé
jailer, 1 recommend that, as he has served
fifteen months eut cf Lwenty, or twelve oul

u

of flfteen, he be released on the god report
he has received. The report is generally
accepted by the Minister of Justice, but
it takes. moniths to get bis answer. I know.
a casç where the prisoner'e time .had expired before the ans'wer arrived. Why?
Becau8e -the Minister of Justice bas te deal
with ail the cases i the 'whole Dominion,
and we know the tune it takee te get ri~ports huom British Colinmbda or Prince E&
ward Island. If a man has beeno.ondemned
for flfteen gnonths and bas served étwelve
months, hie family or his attorney may peititicx the Miniâter of Justice to release him;
but notb.ing ie done until a report is received f rom the judge wiho paassed eentence;
and, though the judge rnay r.eport ian hi.
favour, it would take two or three xnonthz
for the order ta be miade releasing the
prisoner. Why not in snob cases @ive the
Attorney General of the province the
fiane xight as the Minister of Justice
has, and lot the report of the magitrate or judge be sent ta the Attorney General instead of ta Ottawa.? Then
let the Attorney General release the priponer if the report ia favourable, or else report ta the Minister of Justice or to the
Court cf Appeal if there i. anything wrong
with the sentence. In that way we could
eziped.ite maatters, the Minister cf Justice
would be relieved of a lot of work, and
the prieoner in. wboae f avour the report-le
made 'would not bave to, wait for suonths for
action. IL would be a good thing in the
interaats of justice and cf ail poor people'
who are condemned. Thougb the sentence
is generally just, there mnuet be errer somtimes; but, as the Miniater of Justice dces
net act except alter a report from. the province, why net provide, in this Bill te give
the Attorney General -the rigbt te decide
the case at once, .or, if yeu wish, put a
limitation that the amendment would net
ýpply iu the case of sentence to death,
or te penitentiary for hife, or for à stated
number of years.
Hlon. W. B. ROSS: The honourable genitleman has said that he accepta the principle of thîs Bill as stated by the henourable gentleman from Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE: Yes.

60 years crude ail lias been obtained in
Scotland by the retorting of the shales of
that country. The Scotc shales contain
only about one-half the crude oil and less
than half the nitrogen present in the shales
of the Maritime Provinces. Of late years
this trade in Scotl*and lias been very profitable, and the conditions of the world's
supply and the consumption of ail warrants
the conclusion that trade conditions will
reinain favourable.
In the year 1914 the world's total production of crude ail wvas 400,483,489
barrels,
each of 35 imnperia] gallons. In that year
the production of the United States w~as
265,769,569 barrels; in the year 1915 it ivas
281,104,104 barrels; and in 1916, it wvas
3'24,375,503 barrels. There is no doubt that
the total production of the United States in
191#' exceeded 350,000,000 barrels. The large
increase in the production of the UJnited
States will have made up for the reduction
of the output in Roumania and Russia
caused by the present %var. The present
total production of the worid miay safely
be taken as exceeding 400.000,000 barrels.
During the last four years the large stocks
of erude cils previouslv lbeld in thc United
Staites have been gýradually depleted, and
it is expected that by the end of 1918 these
stocks will be eliminated. It is therefore
probable that the present consumption of
the world is around 500,000,000 barrels per
year.
l'le increase of production in the United
States hias been from ail secured froin nev
ail fields. The production from the aId oil
fields is reduced year by year. It is flot
,n'sîble that many discoveries of new ail
filds located in the States will occur, or
should thev accur the location of tlîese new~
fields is likelY do be in reLions inconveniently- placed for transportation. In the
United States attention lias latclv been
called ta the large deporitF of oil-hearing
sha!es situated in Colorado, Utahi, Arizona.
and MNonitana. These deposits are ta be
developed, but as it rcquirez very considerable capital ta develop and work a deposit
of oil-bearing shale, it is idiiitted that no
more crude ail can be expected framn the
ne%% source of supply than will make up
for the certain decrease froîi the ail fields.
The reasons why the ail-shale deposits of
the Mýaritime Provinces have nlot been
developed are flot difficult ta discover.
These reasons are: the industry ta be succe'ssfuilihas ta be undertaken in works of
very considerable magnitude; the cost of
constructingc such works cails for a very
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE.

considerable capital; the material
and
machinery required for such works is flot
mianufactured in Canada; the machinery
required is in flearly ail cases special, and
moreover has ta be adapted ta the qualitv
of the shale it is intended ta operate. The
quaMity of shale varies within wide limits.
Each of these shales requires its awn
peculiar treatment.
Certain antagonistic interests in England,
Scotland and the United States have not
hesitated ta prevent the opening up and
operaiting af these deposits. Not only have
!jlse r,'iîorts been freely spread, but great
pressure lias at times -been brouglit ta bear
upon financial hauses to prevent them from
providing the necessary capital. These
statements can be proven. Again, for soe
years there was no one in Canada wvho was
qualified ta take hold of the construction
and' operation of such works, nor was it
poszible ta find in Scotland any ane who
bein- campetent, understood Canadian conditions. This trouble nov lias ceased ta
exist. '-%r. Louis Simpson, industrial engineer o! this city, has given seven years
in Europe and Canada ta the study af this
prohlim
The information he lias
u
aoquired, conibined with knawledge he bias
already acquired in the construction and
manag-ement of industries that call for vcry
expert technical knowledge bias removed
this difficulty. Mr. Simipszon designed arnd
constructed the first .hydra-electric power
bouse operated in Canada, and is a memiber of the American Electrochemnical Sac;etY.
1 desire t0 state:
That in iny opinion the manifest p)ublie
iuterest of tbe Dominion of Canada sbould
cease ta be lost siffbt of, and tbis so important but so longc neg-lected Can2dian asset
should withiout further delay7 be treated in
a statesuîanlike mianner, irrespective of
narrow-minded prejudice or cf a fear to
undertake wliat may be, a riew departure.
Tbat the interests cf Canada demand that
the $22,000.000 before mentioned shi~c.s
ta ble sent out o! Canada year by year.
That the interests cf Canadian agriculturists and cf the general public demand that
a limit bie placed upon the price at whichi
gasolene is sold.
Thiat the initerests af Canadian manufacturers and cf the general public demand
that the production o! fuel ail in Canada
shaîl be increased and, that a limit bie placed
upon the price at wvhich fuel and gas ails
are sold.
That the initerests of -Canadian shipping
demand tbat arrangaements be made ta pro-

vide a constant supply of high grade fuel
oil at reasonable prices.
Tliat the intereets of the returned soldiers
demand that the development of these
natural resources of Canada, in the development and utilization of which. rany
returned soidiers can be providied with profitable empicyment, under ideal local conditions, be forthwith undertaken.
I feel that the reasons herein given are
more that sufficient to justify the Government considering the question with a view
ot taking immediate action.
Now, 1 arn goiug to give you- some etatistics which will supporit the argument I am
making and should go 'with it, because
Washington is now sending investigatore
to Nova Sootia and New Brunswick te inquire into the inatter, and they should te
fortified with such facta from here a will
show ithat the subjeot, is thoroughly understocd and that we do not depend upon the
ipse dixit of anybody ta know what isirequired.
In -1917. according t<> the etiatistics furnished by the Division of Minerai ]Rescurces
snd, 6tatistics cd the Depaatment of
Mines, under the direction of J. MeLeish,
the importa cf petroleum and petroleum
producta were valued at $21.455.326.
The
statemenit furnished me shows how much
of this total value is macle up of illuminsiting oua., how much of petroleum and gas
cils, how muoch of gasolene, par affl.i wî z,
etc. Figures are given for ahl these products obtained fren ptroleum tbefore it
goes into the handa of the refluer, whose
work is another branch cf -the business.
I have also a report wh.ich I received yesterday from the Commissioner of Customs,
who has very kindly supplied me with
data for 10 years respecting the quantities
imported.

The total quantity of ail, coal and
kerosene, distilled, purified or refined,
irnparted for consumption for the ten fiscal

307

years ended March 31st, 1909 ta 1918. was
114M74,487 gallons, valued at ($7.565,065,
In the Bame ten yesrs -the total quantities
of other oils irnported. for consumption
were: îlluminating cils, 1,258,416 gallons,
valued at $547,573; other products of petroleum, 60,514,243 gallons, valued at $7,811,057; crude petroleum, .1,167,480 gallons,
valued at $90,630; lubricating cils, 39.969.676,
gallons, valued at $5,426,824; and gasalene,
209,217,646 gallons, valued et $27,462.M0.
You. are ail familiar with gasoImae, and it
is not necessary for me te expiain that it
is an urgent need ail thxe year round.
The total imports cf petroleum producta
cf ahl sorts ini the last ten yesrs amounted
to 1,944,859,930 gallons at a declared value
of $100,631,665. Iu the last 12 xnonths thxe
total imported was 387.9%2,711 gallons. and
declared. value $24,889,433.
These enormous fuma of -money were sent
out cf Canada to, purchase cil that could be
produced in our own country, both in Nova
Scotia and in New Brunswick. It, would
seem,,therefore. that I amn justified in bringing tAxis matter before the Heuise in the waY
I amn doing.
I will net trouble you with ail ithe detaila.
but 1 want to place on record a few
statistice. Those enornious sums of moneY
were sent out of the country because we had
net risen sufficiently high in our ideas of
investigation to show what could be done
in this country. I was very glad te, hear
my friend on the other aide of the Houae
<Hon. Sir James Lougheed) say that the
Gcvernment were considering what ould
be done in the future. We have ta mralte
up for ail that vast expenditure we are
now putting eut and for our war lasses,
and we must assist -as f ar as possible inew
industries in this country in order that the
returned soldiers may be provided with
suitable occupation. Therefore if you.conaider these figures ycu will realize that an
immense saving of money could 'be effected.

SENATE

I do not wish ta weary the House with
any lengthy debate on thýis question. My
endeavour is ta bring the tacts s0 torcib-ly
befare the country that they cannot be gainsaid by scientists or stock operators, but
must be accepted as representing accurately
what Canada can do and what this country
has ta offer ta the capitalists of the world
ta -induce people ta coine in and develop
these industries as we are unable ta do
because af the immense amount of money
required.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: I think this ie one
of the most important questions that bas
corne belore the Senate this, session, and I
have much V.leasure in seconding -the
motion. We ail realize that the supply cf
oil in the Pennsylvania ail fields and in
other parts of the United States ie grawing
less, while the demind for ail is growing
greater. On accaunt of the numeraus
inventions which use cil as motive power,
the time is not far distant when the diiferent governSments will have ta look
beyond the present ail wells for their
supplies af ail. I had intended ta make same
remarks upan this subject, because in the
province of Nova Scotia, tram which I cames,
there are very extensive deposits of cil
shales ta be faund in the counties of
Hants, Pictau and Antigondsh. I think the
honourable member for Rathesay (Hon.
Mr. Domville) is ta be congratulated on
the study which hie lias given ta this smbjeot, and on the way in which he. lias
brouglit it ta the attention af thie House.
As I wish ta make some further remarlis ou

ta meet the requirements ai the General

in casualty lists or in any reports ta reveal

Hon. Mr.. McMEA.NS: On behaîf of the
honourable member from Selkirk (Hon.
*Mr. Bradbury), I beg leave ta move that
the Bill bie nat now *read a third. time, but
be amended as follows:Add the 'follawIng ta clause 6 as subsection. 4
of section 25:
"(4) It shall te -prima facle evidence that-a
perron la not entitied ta obtain letters patent
for a hoenestead, If having been originally a
aubject of, or resident in, any of the statea now
at war with Hie Majesty and having become

persan bas, at any time since the firat day of

ontrary ehall be upon any such person."
Page 4, line 4.-For "las" substîtute "asub-

Hon. Mr. POWER: With the amendment as a whole I have no quarrel, but I
would draw the attention ai the Hou&e ta
the fact that it cantains an unu6ual and
what I consider an unreasonable addition
in the words af the last line: "and the
burden of proof ta the contrary shall be
upon any sucli persan." That is not anly
contrary ta all aur traditions of British
law and British sense of lair play, but it is
practically making the poeitian ai the
claimant -an impassible one. While I do

Hon. 'Mr. MeMEANS: While I arn only
rnoving this arndment on behaif of the
hon>ourable genbleran from Selkirk, I canflot agree with the suggestion made by the
honourable gentleman from Halifax. I
think it must be apparent Vo every member
of tbis Houe. that il a man residing in
Canada goe to Gerrnany immedýiately 'pria?
to the war, and then cornes back to Canada,
il would be almogt an irnpossibility for the

within bis own knowlodge, and I fan>ey that
la the reason why the words ini question are
put In. I think the burden of proof -should
properly be upon the clairnant, because he
is the only one who has that knowledge,
and if lie is able to negative the charge that
he vwent to-fight against the Allies, it would.
b. a very eimple rnatteri-or hirn te prove

this is a different matter, -for this man vent

closed before the Bill could pass, and we
had to take it up again this year; but this
clause was left out.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Will my
honou-rable friend from Granville permit
me ta refer him ta page 3512 of the Gommons Hansurd, from which he will find Vhat
Mr. Boulay moved what was practically the
same as this amendment, and apparentiy
it was adopted. by the Commons. He said:
1 move that this subsection be amended by
adding thereto, the tollowing words:
"And ail employees coming ln contact with
the travelling publie shall understand bath
official languages of the country."

I was unde- the imipression that Mr.
Boulay had moved this subsection, and it
would appear that such was the case. Apparently, to make d'oubly aùdre, the Minister
of Railways rnoved it again.
Han. Mr. OHOQUETTE: Mr. Boul.ay, the
member for Rimouski, a friend of the Gov«ernment, suggested the clause ta, the. Government, and the Government was so impressed with the suggestion that tâhe minister taok upon himsetf the responsibility of
moving it. When my honourable friend said
that it was proposed by a prîvate membez
he was not mtaking -an accurate statement.
Every member of the Hanse may make
suggestions ta the Governanent. If I were
ta propose something ta the leader of the
Government in this House, and if he were
impressed with my proposition as one that
was just and fair, and were to take it and
anove iL himself, the Government'would be
responsible for it, and those who voted
agaainst it would be voting againat the Governmient.
In brin'ging t.his matter before this House,
I do flot think that I eau be accused of
doing any1thing that is unjuet or unfair, or
raisin.&racial issues, because I simply foilow the lead of the Minister af Railways.
In his speech the othe-r dey, the honourable gentleman from Welland (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) mentioned a resoiutivn that was
passed by representatives of certain railway
organizatians, in which the foilowing appeared:
The proposed legislsitiob might re"ut in a gra.ve
Injustice ta many experlenced employees in the
'province of Quebec who are not conversant with
the English language. but who are perxnitted
to converse in their native language in the
course of their eînployment, and ta even pas:
their oral examninationa ta the positions af
conductors or engineers ln such language,

If that was signed by members of the
,organizatian in Quebec, they certainly had

not a knowledge opfthe actual conditions,
becaus-e 1 knew that there is flot a man in
Quebec who will acoede ta it. Ail the men
employed by the railways in Quebec are
conversant with bath languages. I d'are say
they would nat be able ta retain their positions if they could flot *speak English.
Further, in order ta impress the French
memibers of this House, the honouraie
gentleman from Welland said:
I explaîned ta the flouse on Friday last that
there were French Canadian men reuiding in
British Columbia and working an railwayu who
atated that they object ta this clause being
enacted because It wauld militate againat them,
and prabably a movement wauid be put on foot
that, would snake It impossible for them ta
work upon a railway ln the West because theY
could flot speak Flnglish.

I defy t~he honourable gentleman ta name
one =nan, one conductar, one brakeman,
one statian agent, in British Columbia wha
cannat speak Engiish. In order ta 'be fair
ta the people of British Columbia, as I
wish ta be fair ta the people of my o'wn
province, I amn willing ta -have the legislation anaended sa as ta campel ail the
Frenchi eanductors on British Columbia
railways 'ta learn Engish or ta, resign their
positions. The Engiah public in British
Columwbia have just as much right ta have
the conductore there apeak their language
as the people of Quebec have ta have the
conductars in that province understandi and
speak theirs. I arn willing ta vote for an
amendment ta campai. every railway employee in every province ai this Dominion
ta epeak 'bath languages, and if my people
cannot tinderstand English so nrnch the
worse for them. I wieh ta show that this
is not a question ai French or Englîsh; it
is a question af 'bath offic.ial languages being
learned anud spoken by everyone, espe-cially
by those who are in the employ ai the
public. I do nat wish my people ta be
handicapped as my hanourable friend from
the West (Han. Mr. Michener) has been.
1 aim convinced that that is the oniy right
thing ta do, and that it wiIl accomplish
mare good, nat only for the provinces, but
for the country and the Empire at large.
Now, honourable gentlemen, I wili not
detain you any 'longer on this question. 1

clause so just, so fair, and one spproved
by this House, bas been ta.ken out of the

If not, then I will let the public judge.
Now, honourable gentlemen, it is of no
use for me te discuas thîs question longer;
eo, with the leave of the House, I withdraw my motion and move ins.tead the following. There is no need for me te give
notice of this motion, be-cause this is a
public Bill. I gave notice yesterday of my
motion te be rnoved on the third reading,
go that honourab]e gentlemen might be
aware of it. I now move:
'Mat fthe followlng ibe added to section 2-02:

Hon. E. L. GIRROIR: Ronourable gentlemen, before this question is put I wish
te make a few observations. I wîll preface
themn by saying thaît we belong to the
greate.st Empire the world bas ever seen.
Thank God, we can say that this Empire
is an Empire founded upon the principle
that no -man's language, or no mian's creed,
Mon. Mr.

CHOQUETTE.

or no mnan's race shahl stand in the way of
There is absolute liberty,
absolute justice, end absohute equality for
ail. I stand for this principle, that in this
Canada of ours every man should have
bis advancement.

the

privilege of

speaking

any

language

which he desires. 1 believe, sirs, that no
man within the borders of this fair Domcinion, if we wish te m.ake it a prosperous
country, should be prevented from speakingc in the language wbich he desires, and
I hope that ahl Canadians -will stand for
that principle.
But the honourable member (Hon. Mr.
Choquette) who bas just made this motion
is standing for another -and far different

principle: he is standing for this proposition, that men in this country mnust be
compelled to speak a certain language. He
said only a fei' moments ago that il he had
bis way be would compel every man who
is elected te the Rouse of Commons or
appointed te tbis Senate te speak both
languages. The unity which we desire in
tbis Canada of ours can neyer corne ont of
the advocacy of aiich a principle as that.
We in this country can neyer advance as
we shouId advance, and have the unity
wbich is essential to the advancement of
this Empire, unless we are prepared to give
way one te the other, to respect each
otber's faith and each other's la-nguage.
But, airs, wben a man stands up in thîs
H-ouse and declares that I shall be compelled te speak the English language, or
that some other member of tbis House shall
be cornpelled te speak the Frencb language,
I tbink he is advocating a principle wbich
is detrimental te the very interests wbich
be aims te serve.
The French Canadians of Canada are one
of the greatest assets of this Dominion. They
are a vigorous people, a people who wihl lend
their strength and vigour te the a.dvancement of this country in the years to corne. I
arn sure, sirs, that the people of Canada can
feel grlad t.hat we bave in this country people
of different races and speaking different
languages, hecause it affords us an opportunity of obtaining various v'iews upon ail

public questions. The nation that wiil spring
out of the union of these different races will
be one of the most virile and one of the
strcngest races' inhabiting any part of tbis
great Empire. I arn proud, sirs, of the fact
that in my veins flows some of the blood
that flows in the veins of the defenders of
Verdun. I ami proud, sirs, that rny father
was of French blood, just as proud as I amn

House, flot anywhere else, and say ta any
man, "You muet speak the English languagle," o-r, " You muet speïk the French
language.",
This is a question that has been disturbing the unity of this country -for many
years, and 1 believe that the unity of this
country will neyer be achieved un-less
Englishmen in Ontario -and other parts af
Canada and Frenchmen in Quebec are
*repared ta let the question lie dormant for
a while. If we caninai settieý aur differences
upan this score, then, for God's sake, let us
forget them. Here we are to-day throughout
thi- country sending aur boys, French and
English, ta the. trenches af Flanders ta
fight for thia Empire. They are spilling
thelr iblood; their blood le flowing i the
self same stresan. And do you imagine for
one moment that these boys, when they
assist each other--when the French Canadian boy. f takes from his knapsack
the. stimulants that have been given
him and paurs thein down the throat
of some dying English boy, perhaps an
Orangeman irom* Ontario, or when some
Protestant boy, -or English-speaking' boy
who canmot speak French, carrnes on his
back .ta safety same French Canadian who
'las *been wonnded while fighting valiantly
for the. cause of this Empire-do you suppose it makes any difference ta themn
whether the language of pity in which ithey
express, theïr thanks to one another le in.
French or in (Engish? I think, sire, that t~he
best thing for thre future cf thie. country and
this Empire le for us ta discontinue publie
agitation upon thie question. Prejudice or
narrowness has caninibalistie tendencies:
prejudice. i one province feede upon. prejudice i the other province. For my part,
f rom t.he experience t.?nat I have had -in
tihe few short years I have been here, where
1 ..have heard. these questions d-isc-uesed,
I ar n l a positin to -say-and I ,eay
At boldly, I say it openly-that there le
just as much prejudice and narrowness
in the province oi Ontario as there Je in
the province cf Québec. But there are
many men i this country w-ho are able to
look above and beyondthat nerrow groove,
and it is the duty ai these men, especially
when tiiey constitute themselves leaders of
the -respective races i the different province-lit is their duty, in the interest of
their own people, oft his country and of!
this Empire, to endeavour ta do ail they
can toa mooth away the .differences af
language and of race which exist in tues
Dominion. We have ta live together; we
have ta struggle together ta anake, this

Canada oi oure a great country; we have
ta die together i this country. While I
arn ready and prepared always ta stand for
the right of every man ta speak whatever
language he wishes, I will neyer stand for
the principle enunciated by the honourable
member who has moved this motion <Han.
Mr. Choquette), that any citizen ai Canada,
or even ai this Empire, should b. eornpelled ta speak any particulan language.
Hon. Mn. BELCOURT: I would ask my
honourable friend who bas juet'st down
i-f ho is a.ware that in order ta enter the
*Civil Service ai Canada it is obligatany ta
know tihe Englieh lauguage?
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: That le anathen
question a}together.
Han. Mr. DANDURÂND: We have just
heard-a pleasing oratiion. an the importance ai
jaining hands and wonking iu unlty for
the national cause sud for the cause af the
Allies. Nobedy"will heeltate ta commend
the aspiration for national unity aud for
everything that wHI make for the suocees
ai the. Alies; but this is not thbe questionwhich ia before us just now. We are discuseing the- Railway Act; and lu the discussion of thie Act we came ta section 302,
which speaks ai the twa languages. Subsection 2 of the Bill brought in by the
Government cf the day saye:
Every rullway
the. EngUseh and
taJble thiat are to
the. Uikfl of the

ornwouy ahail print In both
French languages the. Urne-b. usai along it Unes wit-hin
proviuee of Quebec.

Naw, we have ahl voted for that. It is
in a Bill ai the present Gavernment. It
has had the endorsation ai the honourable
leader ai the Government in this Chamber.
It le adopted. A motion ie now made for
the third reading ai the Bill, and I am
sure that the section as it stands, with
that clause, wilI be adopted; snd yet the
two languages are maintained -in it. But
why are tiiey rnentioned? They are mnentianed because the constitution ai Canada
mentions snd sanctions the use of two
languages, in the province of Quebec. Remember, honourable gentlemen, that the
amendment which is now moved has
nathing ta do with the other provinces;
it affects only the province ai Quebec, just
as subsection 2 concerne only that province.
What does subsection 3, the -clause naw
under discussion, in thie latin ai an amendment, provideP It sys purely sud simply
that:

Iwill not address myself to the remarks
made by my honourable friend from Antigonish (Hon. Mr. Girroir) just now, because
he has not touched the question at ail.
But I wilI deal with the words wthich fell
f rom the lips of the honourable leader of
the Government in this Chaxnber (IRan.
Sir James Lougheed) a few days ago, when
we were in committee. He sa.id: -The Liberal
party was ini power for 15 years and it did
not move in this matter; why do you move
in the zuatter nowP" My answer is: No,
the Liberals did not move in this inatter
for 15 years. There was a Frencih Premier
and he did not think »of moving in the
matter. But who did move in the matter?
As the honourable inemiber frein Granville (Hon. Mr. Choquette) said, the Minister of Railways last year rnoved in the
matter; he moved that this clause be put
in. It was inse-rted at the suggestion of
a supporter of the Government, itii e true,
but the minister moved that the clause be'
inserted. The constitution wals not shaken.
The motion wae carried unanimously. That
was the action of the Governrnent last year.
Was anybody in
Who was scandalized'
this Chamber ecanýdalized? It was rny
honourable friend the honourable leader o!
the Goverument in this Chamber who
întroduced the Bill last year with subsection 3 in it, and he was- not scandalized.
The sight of that clause d'id not make him
grow pale or strike hirn with horror. No;
be mo'ved that the Bill be sent to the
Committee on Railways, -and there the
clause was discussed. A slight arnendinent
was introduced. The honourable gentleman
(Hon. Sir James Loug4heed) arld ail of us
votedà for the clause. Yet the constitution
was not éhaken. The amendinent which
was introduced-I do not knew at whose
request- simply altered the clause by adding after the word's " the board mnay"- the
following words: "alter hearing on such
notice and ta such persons s the 'board
rnay determine." The clause was adoptied.
The Bill dia not corne before us because
we bad not. finished the work in the comrnittee when the House cloaed. The Bill
now cornes back to us, handed into this
Chamber by the saine leader of the House
who brought in the Bill last year, but the
third sub-clause is not in it. Yet it had

passed the House of Gommons, -and At carne
here hast year-brought by whornP By my
honourable friend the leader of the Gevernment in this Chainher. Was it not our
duty to take notice cf the fact ithat that
clause waa dropped, se that when the Bill
would return to the House of Glommons
sorne explanation would be given to the
Commoners 'why that clause was not
thereP It devolved uponl us to give an explanation. I rose froin my seat and asked
why -that -clause -waB net in the Bill. It
was adopted by the Senate, and fifty or
sixty -members o! this Chaxnber were.on the
Railway Cornmittee. Sorne few additions
have corne to this Chamnber. and death has
closed the -eyes of only two or thTee members
sinee then, so thet it is practically ibefore
the saine House. What bas happened to
bring about that change in the mind of
my honeurable friend-because it -was the
action cf the Government last year, and
tbe ministry then ompriseid the same
Prime Minister and practically the same
men as it does to-day. with smre additions,
it is true. Yet, though the Bill is bere,
that clause is net in it. I moved to restore it. Well, iny f riend made the inost
ertraordinary defence for bis omission-. -He
said, - What are we coming toP" That
was a condemnation of the Hon. Mr. Cochrane, because iît was bis action hast year;
and we heard in tb.is Chamber the question, "S8hahl a British subject be forced to
learn a second language?" In Qurebec the
two languiages. are on an equal footing; one
can speak the French language and bis
neighbouf can apeak the English. No one
in Quebec js obliged ta epeak the twe languages by virtue of tbe constitution; yet
my henourable friend raised the constitutional -question. What does it ainount te
but to affirin Ehat ne ene in Queébec shall
be obliiged ta speak the English language,
snd no one in Ontario shaîl be ohhiged ta
s-peak the French language? Everybocly
admits that.
But that is net the question. The question is this: cari the !lovernmnent, of Canada or can the Postmaster General pro
dnasmuch as pur Postmaster Gentem --eral is prornenading in Europe and has
been for a long time-eau my bonourable
!rieud claim that he would have the right
te appoint an English-spealcing po-stimaster
inany muuicipality cof the province cf Quebec where not an English electer exists,
an exclusively French regtieu, and s-ay,
"This is an Act which. is in oonformity
wi'th the letker end spirit and -the constitutien"? Would anyone iu this -Ohamber

APRIL 25, 1918
stand for the appointment of a .post.maeter
who could net speak one word of French,
in any municIpality in the province of
Quebec where there is lot an Englishman?
I put the question; eand it is sufficient te
put it to have the answer. It vould be
something unheard of and unthinkable
that when , two l-an-guages are officiai in
a province a rep resentative of the Goverument should b. appointed who could nlot
mpeak a word ot the -language which is exclusively spaken araund him. Yet if my
honourable friend werie Poaftmaster Generai
and were to do that, and I went ta hini snd
sead te hlm, "WeU, now, the eternal fitues.
of things should avail lu this instance, and 1
should not need to appeal te -Parliament to
have thaît pootmaster replaced," what would
ho answer me? He would answer lu the sanie
language as he used the other day. Striking
an attitude, h. would isay: "Do you mntend ta
force Englishmen to learu FrenchP 1 have
appointed John Jones, and why should
John Jones be forced te spea.k FrenchP It is
a perversion of the constitution." Well, 1 amn
miot adkiug that John.Joues learn French,
but I am asking that John Joues be not
made the pootmasteroaithatplace. Hecould
b. made postmaater o! nine-tenths et the
peut offices of Canada, but I do not want
bim ta be appaiutedï'at that place. That la
ail tihere waa ln the, resolution proposed by
the Hou. Mr. C3ochrane, thon Minister af
Railways, 'with the snction o.f the 'wiole
Houa. of Commons.
My honourable friend said: "«There 15 an
Euglîsh-spe.aking conductor on a local
train lu Quebec, aud you want to force that
man ta learn French." No, I want hlm ta
be placed elsewhere, among a population
that will understand hlm. Now I reverse
the proposition whiaii my honourable iriend
has made. He asks us: "Would you force
that conductor ta learu French on that
local train -in the province of Quebec?" No,
I would net ask that; but there ii; one thing
that 1 do ask, which is that the whole
population af that district shall not b.
farced ta Igarn Englîshin order ta' conil
municate with that conductor, because, as
I have said, railways and railway employee.s are made ta serve the conimunity,
and if my honourable friend's point was
well taken that community shouid neot be
forced ta learu a second Janguage. I
dlaim that I amrnft forcing the. conductor
ta. learu two languages, because he can
speak hm own language wherever he
pleases ,and where he will be uuderstoad;
but I ask my hanourable friend if h. wants

ta force the whole population lu a day, or
over uight, ta learu the Enghiali language
in order ta commu.nlcate with that conductar while the. twa languages are ou an
equxl footing in that province. This is the
question I put ta my houourable friend.
I conless that 1 was thuuderstruck with
the attitude of the hanaurable leader and
his frieuds araund him wlieu 1 raised the
question lui -the -Chamber - tue upper
Ohambe-r of wiser mou, of aupposedly eaberminded men, removed froni the. passions

aur sens. ai duty, aud has asked us ta put
aside ail sectional ýprejudice9 and vota on

SENÂTE

mû0

and justice. On those principles of equity
and justice I propose to vote on this question. Since I have had the honour of being
a inember of this Chamber I have noticed
that there is a doctrine of vested rights. recognized here above ail otherg. It has aiways been said tjhat an Englishman has far
more respect for-a man's property than for
a man's life, and that the Englisai law
throws around property such safeguards
as are not cast around human liýfe. A man
may kick hi& wife nearly to death and be
fined five dollare, because under the <Ad
superstition of En.glarxd a man may do
as hie ehooses with bis own; but if he steals
a loaf of bread hie goes te prison, and a few
years ago he would have lost his life, because property is above everytihing. Now
we are asked ta vote to give the railway
board of this country tlhe riglit te say that
no -man shall be entitled to make bis livelihood as a railway conductor or brakezman
in.the province of Quebec unless hoe is £0
highly educa.ted t.hat ho speaks both the
French and English languages.
For fiftyyears we have had railroads in
Canada; for fifty years the Government and
railway compaaiies have encouraged men
te devote their lives te the management
of railways, to learning their business as
railway employees, and have held out te
thein as an inducement to begin at the
lowest rung, that as they aidvanced ini years
they would,-advance in position, and ini
course of time *might attain very .high and
lucrative office in the railway, and might
hope te gain a position in their own country
in consideration of a well-spent lufe. But
now these honourable gentlemen, who would
never vote te deprive anybody of a vested
interest, who hold up their hands in ho]y
horror when you wish to take away fromn
some company an imaginary rîght, who
are willing to show that the principles of
thle constitution -are 'beîng violated, and
that never before in this assembly was a man
asked te do such a thing as to deprive anyone of -hi&
property right-these honourable
gentlemen are willing te say to a middleaged Frenchman or Englishman who lives
in the province of Quebec -and bas spent
his life toiling to attain the position wbich
he occupies: "'You must gîve up your
means of livelihood, or you -must go to a
far country in exile from your native province, because you cannot apeak both the
French and English languages." la such
a proposition based on morality? Is it
based oi fair dealing? la it based on any
principle of justice in, French or English
jurisprudence? I challenge the honourable
gentlemen who are advocating this amendHonL .Nir.

ment to justify their position on any
principle of religion, of morality, or of
jurisprudence.
Hon. Mr. GHOQUE11TE: Hew doees the
honourable gentleman explain that this
provision was introduced by Hon. Mr.
Cochrane, and was voted unanimously in
the House o-f Gommons, il it is s0 wrong?
I wilI
-Hon. Mr. LYNOH.'SLUNTON:
explain that. In my time I have known
a mob. to run aiter and wish to destroy a
man; but that dee not prove that it was
right.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE: But why did
the membere of the House of Gommons
adopt that?
1 have
Hon. Mr. LYNOH-STAUNTON:
known the House of Gommons "te vote
unanimously on a question, but that did not
prove -that it was right. 1 have known
rninisters in many countries to advocate
measures on the floor of Parliament, but the
tact that they adTocated them does 'not
satisfy me, without further inquiry, that
they were right. I do not grant to any
man the right te compel me te vote because
thie House of Gommons vote was, so-and-so,
or because an honourable minister voted
so-and-eo. The question is whetherthis proposai is right of wrong, noL whether the
House of Gommons wishes it to beoome law,
flot whether the )dinister cf Railways put
his seal on it, but whether or not we are
justified in voting for it. I aek these genitlemon, who are educated. men, toeoxplain te
me on principles of justice why 1, who have
spent my life learning a business, and have
risen te be a conducter on a railway, should
ho told, under the law of this country that
whon 1 am fifty years old I must givo up,
my position because 1 carmot speak English
or French, as the case mnay bo.

that.

Nobody asks

Hon. Mr. LYNGH-STAUNTON: The honourable gentlemen want the ra.ilway board
to have the power te say that i»nless a mnan
is conversant with both languages hie may
be deprived of his position. We do flot
imagine for one moment that -the railway
board would evor exercise the power; but I
challenge the honourable gentlemen to strip
this question of ail argument as te what the
House of Gommons did, and justify it tapon
principles of right and justice. I ask them
if they ean justify the dis-charge of a man
who has worked faithfully, and against
whom there is no wrongdoing or othor just
cause found, fron 'bis position in the prov-

APRIL 25, 1918
ince of Quebeýc becauce lie cannot speak
English, or frein his position in the province
of Ontario because h~
'cannot speak French,
or saying to hini: "leur farnily are here,
your relations are here, but you are an
Englis-h-speaking man, and you mus:4 go up
to Ontario and hunt another job." If they
can justify that on any principle of justie
or right dealing, it will go fur to convince
me that they are flot again endeavouring
te raise this everlasting feud frorn whici
ail Canada is suffering.
Hon. -Mr. GORDON: The honourable
member for De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) rerninds me of the Quaker whe
once aaid to bis wife: "Ail people in this
world are queer ex'cept me and th'ee, and
sonietimes,
niethinks, even thou art a
littie queer." The honourable gentlemnan»
appears to think that a great deal
of prejudice
prevail-s
on' this aide
of the House.
I just rise to ask
him to pause for a moment to consider this
question. 1 ask him if hie cannot place any
faith in the Government, and try to convince
liniseif that the people who are
managing the railroads of this country
have a little conimon sense. If he does
I am sure that lie will cease bringing up
questions which bave a tendency to create
unrest among the people of the country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It was rny hionourable f riend the leader of the Governnient who brought it Up last year.
Hon. Mr. GORýDON. I want to irnpress
upon the honourable gentleman the fact
that the railroad managers of this cou.ntry
are trying to run the railroads s0 as to
niake money for the shareholders. In order to do that they muet have competent
servants on their trains, servants who understand the language of the people in the
part of *lhe country through which the
trains are running. They have such servants; and should the tinie corne when
they have not, it would miean that they
were not fit to run the railroads any longer.
The law of this country does not compel
the Postinaster General to appoint postmasters whio can speak both English and
Frenchi; but lie lias enougah coinion sense
to appoint nen who know the language
e« the people with whorn tliey have to deal.
I arn sure that policy hias been carried out
in the province of Quebec. I therefore ask
mnv honourable friend frorn De Lorimier
(Hion. Mr. Dandurand) to -ive the Governmient credit for hiaving sorne colurnon sense,
instead of trying to agitate the people oif
this country over petty questions like this.

REVISED

Hon. RU FUS POPE: Honourable gentlemen, I do flot desire to prolong tais unfortunate discussion, wnich I hoped we
!ad heard the last cf the other evening.
It is to be regretted that honeurable gentlemen feit that it was their duty to renew
this discussion.*
The honourable gentleman from De Lorimnier (Hon. 'Mr. Dandurand), if I arn right,
said that_ ve owe a duty te the minorities
as well as to the majorities in Canada.
One result of the British North America
Act was the creation cf the Sonate cf Canada, and if it tias one purpose more than
another, lt is to proteet the interests if
iiinorities in this country wherever they
happen te be. If the legisiation that is
proposed here to-day had any practical
effect at ail, it would be te eis turb the coinfort of a few eld, Engliah-speaking conductors in the province of Quebec, who have lonlpassed the time when they co'uld acquire
a knowledge ot the 'two languages. The
honour.able gentleman f roin De Lorimnier
said that it is our duty tto rise, siot
only upon bro-ad and nation-al questica
but alsù in defence cf the minorities that
are peculiar te ourselves. Being an Engliehspeaking Protestant from QuËbec, I think
it is my duty te raise any voice on behaîf
of the few English-speaking conductors stili
in that province, ,and te ask the members
of this House te aee that no legislation is
passed here that will do any injury or cause
any disad-van-tage te those men who have
served faîthfuily for se many years on the
railroads of Quebec.
Horn. H. J. CLORAN: This discussion reminds -me of a fable cof Lafontaine. He
wes describing the -attitude cf the wo-lf and
the larnib. The wolf one fine morn.lng felt
thirsty .and went te the stream. He went
up to the source, the head ef the flowing

feet down the streain. The laimb was thirsty
too, and commîenced to quaff the wa't-er. The

Hon. Mr. GORDON: You must be a

Hon. Mr. CLORAN: Even a .black sheep

sheep, lias as much rigbt to justice and fair
play aé a white sheep; so Christ said when
the prodigal son came back. He got a big

Hon. Mr. -CHOQUETTE: They do not
understand.
Hon.. Mr. GLORAN: No, ithey do not
understand. It is hard for a lamb to deal
with a wolf. The honourable gentleman irore
Granville (Hon. Mr. Choquette) lias donc
a service to the country in bringing this
matter up again, and I will tell you why.*
The vote which was takenl laet Monday
nig-ht M'as taken under false representation.
I myseif was pretty nearly shaken, but flot
too mucb. 1 asked one of the ministers
acress the floor of the House if the clause
which he himself introduced last year, and
which hie now suppressed, was net the saine
clause that was introduced by the Govern,.
ient tbroug-h its Minister of Railways.
The answver to me was, "No, that suggestion wvas introduced by a private mcmber." I did flot happen to have Hansard
under my eyes, a nd was not in a position
to flatlv contradict the minister or ministers îvho made that statement. It is weil
tbat the country should be informed as to
how legisiation is passed and how it is put
throughl in this honourable House. Therefore, iii that lighlt alone, the honourable
cent leinan bas done a service to the people
of Canada. especially to the people of the

province of Quebec, in again bringing
forward this question. Several gentlemen
have spoken as though this clause, -whichi
%vas originally adopted by the Gevernmient
-and 1 arn -lad to say it was adepted by
the old Conservative Governnîent at tîmat,
which, altbough it was pretty moribund,
stili hiad a few elernents of justice in its

it if it hiad not been hialf dead.
[Hon. ".%r. CLORAN.]

Hon. Mr. CLORAN: I amn afraid the Coli-

servative Government lias been contaminated by this union.
Hon. Mr. POPE: Very likely.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: It is not only likely,
it is absolutely ýsure.
Hon. Mr. POPE: 1 think you are right.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: I arn right, and yrni
know it, and I want ne papal authority for
that.
This clause does not seek to drive old.
employees out of business. It is camouflage
argument that bas been given to, us by the
member for the Easterrn Townships (Hon.
Mr. Pope), the member from. Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton), and, I am

granted omi the 19tb of Julv last year, when
itz Ministr cf Railways, representing the

APRIL 25, 1918
whole force ci the Coneervative Government, had this clause put inte the Bill.
The hocurable gentleman groin Antigonx.h -proteste very eloquently:- "How in
the naime of the Empire, un.ity, end so on,
can this HIouse compel any man to 6peak
any language that 'he does, mot want to
speak?" If we -de mot compel. them to
speak, we compel themn te write, and t-bat
ie a more serious at-tack on a man'&liberty.
The old Latin code was, "S6crwpta manient,
sed verba fugiunt, "-wrtinge remain, but
words fly. And yet t.he Conservative Government ot, lest year introduoed inota the
raîlway legielation a clause com.pelling citizens toa write thbe two languages. What

the found>ation away -from hie eloquence nd

I thmnk I have answered the arguments
of the honourable gentleman frai» Ha-mit<>n and the honourable gentleman froin
the Fasterui Townships, in regard to
t-bat. I cannot for the lite of me ses why
the present majority lu the. House reverses
ite acion, or why the leader o ftie Government swallows thbe full <neagure of justice,

or in support of legisiation t-bat will milit-at. against the rights of eny citizen, n2o

Hon. Mr. DOlMVILLE: There je no Union

Hon. Mr. CIORAiN: No, they took very

Hon. Mr. CIOÎRAN: I will support their

The honoureble gentleman fromn

Rotbesay <Hon. Mr. Dumville) is correctthere 'is none. Tqhere is a union on the
other side of Parliament, and it is under
Union Government that thia injustice le
scught to be perpetrated and bas been perp'etrated in the name of liberty, boly unity,
and justice.
What a farce!
We eimply
ask that t-he million and a haif or two
million people of the. province of Quebec
be dealt witb on underetandable Unes. We
know, as the honourable gentleman fromn
Nipissing <Hon. Mr Gordon) lhas st-ated,
that the heada of thbe railway companies
are not foola. They are not geing te put
men in positions where t-hey will barse
a company and undo its business.
We
want our righta recegnized in black and
white in, the statutes, as preposed by the
leader of t-h. GovernmnenL in this House,
auil by the entire Conaervative Go-vernment
of lest year. There ie nothing revolutionary about that. But I hear the wolf cry
out: " Oh, but you are reising these questione and creating dissen.ion." Naturally
t-be wolf does not want te be intoriered
with; but some day the lemb will have a
champion, and thlen the wolf bad better
look out. Remember, to-day yen are acting largely on prejudice, on faise ideas
of patrkotism, on falae ideas of 'union.
Be square wit-h your felio-w-citizen. of thbe
French race. Even. up with. t-hem, as you
de with your own. There is ne dieunlo-in

Hon. JAMES DOMVILLE: Honourable
gentlemen, soine of us are getting very sick
of this aubjeot. We. heur it day in and day
out, hour by hour, and it is nau&eating. I
can see that my honourable friends eutbscribe te -what, I say. We cannot lick the
French into line, nor can they liek the
Engliah..speaking int line; so. let the wo'lf
and the lamb get along as best they can.
Why should 'we have the saine arguments
%beatenday alter day. hour alter heur, into
our heads? We menýbers of the Opposition
are willing te give the Governzmeut fair
play and t0 amst the Government, but our
ha.ving te listen to these "mse arguments
se otten repeated doeS not assist the Gov,ernment. If they -were repeated once, or
twice, or 'three tirnes. it would net b. so
bad; but, to have them gone over hour alter
hour te too ,nuch. I can, tell some of mY
hououra'ble friends bhere that 'w. froin the
lower provinces are not too, much abuck on
tbis question of languages-not too inuch
stuck. My honourable lriend (Hon. Mr.
Girroir) says w. are Britieh aubjeots .and
want fair play for everybody. If we, want
to advance a cause, let us do it in a way
that wiii not convey te the masses of the
people th. idea tb.at it is a seottion.al, racial
or Quebec question. Now I think we have
had enough of it.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I quite agree with the
honourable gentleman from Rothesay <Hon.
Mr. Doinville) that we have had enough of
the kind o! discussion which is going on in
the Chamber now, but I may be pa.rdoned
il I add a little to the discussion. I do it,
not because I care to be mixed up in this
discussion, but because I wish to give some
reason forAhe vote that I propose to cast
on this occasion.
The honourable gentleman tram De Lorirnier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) clrew a picture
which vas calculated to) shake the nerves
of an ordinary persan, but 1 do flot think
that the tacts o! the case bear out the details, at any rate, of that picture. Honourable gentlemen, I have been travelling over
the Interooloaxial now for 40 years plus one,
and I have neyer known any incouvenience
te arise from the absence Of a knowledge of
either language on the part of a conductor
or any other important oficer of the road.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: The
gentleman took a Pullman.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN.

honourable

Hon. Mr. POWER: I have found., for instance. that as a yule, I think almost uniformly, the conductor who takes charge o!
the thain at Cainpbellton and brings us up tb
Montreal is French, and the conductor below
Campbellton is not French-speakmng. The
point is this, that no one bas ever Ibeen able
te show that any Berioue inconvenience
has arisen frýom 1h. existing condittion
o! things, and I thin-k tiraI undertaking te
legislate for imaginary evils, for evils that
may neyer corne to paso, is -a very poor sort
of legieiation. Not only is this legieiation
unnecesar--not called for Iby the existing condition of! things, but it is calculated
to do serious misehief. I wifl not go over
aga-in the apeech made by the honourable
gentleman from Welland (Hon. Mr. Robertson) with respect t0 that .matter; but the
honourable gentleman produced the evidence of the parties interested, the French
Canadian employees as weli as tire English
employees on the Government railways. te
show that they were asking that this amendment, or one aluivaient te il, should net be
passed. 6eeing that no inconvenience or
difficulty has erisen in the paet, why should
we undertake t0 do -something tirat may
seriously prejtdicethe interests of the employees on the roadP I feul te see that there
bas been shown, any reason for that. As 1
say, I think the honourable gentleman from
Welland made that point very clear.
Another reason why I do net f eel able,
I amn very. sorry te say, te vote with the
gentlemen with whom I ususlly vote, is
tiret this matter ha& been discussed et
length in this Chamber alreedy and we had
a vote the other even-ing. l the amendment
moved in the committee had been defeated
by a narrow majority I should think
that there- would have been some justithe
matter up
fication for bringing
again, but my remembrance is that the vote
was-38 againat the, motion and 4,0 for il.
Now, I do net thmnk that it is worthy o!
grave and reverend seignors like ourselves
to undertake te diseuss over again a question o! that sort, with such a division
before us. We are not children. We are
net-I was gaing to say-we are not women.
We are nlot liable te change our minds very
suddenly et any rate; and 1 therefore feel
that I should be doing a wrong te the
people, particularly te tire. French Cariadieu employece on the Government railways, if'I were ta vote for this amendment.
Hon. P. W. CHOQUETTE: May I be
perinitted ta say a word or two in reply to
the remarks made? 1 must say I am

APRIL 25, 1918
amazed at statements made by the hionourable gentleman froni Hamilton (Hon. Mr.
Lynch-Staunton), and the honourable gentleman f.rom Nova &cotia (Hon. M~r. Power).
The honourable gentleman from Hlamilton
certainly made a slashing indictmnent of t'he
House of Commons when hie said that they
were a mob that pushed the Government
on to move and vote last year for the sanie
thing that I arn asking this House to vote
for to-day. So I think that what the honourable gentleman says ie rather against
the Government, his own friends, than
against the mover of this motion.
In the next place, the honourable gentleman fromn Halifax stated that in ail the
years hie has been travelling on the Intercolonial railway hie has had no difficulty.
That ie because in his own province hie
langue.ge was und-erstood and in Queïbec ail
the French conductors could speak English
and did ail they could for him. But the
honourable gentleman's statement that
thie ie poor legielation je another slashing
indictmnent ageinet the Govern.ment, and
againet himeelf, who voted for thie propoeed clause last year. I eannot understand ho-w the honourable gentleman can
have-I do not know what parliamentery
termn to use-the brazenness, the audacity.
to stand up end say that what ive are now
esking for is poor legislation, when this
very gentlemian hiniseif, in this House and
in the cornmittee, voted for it. I canni)t
understar.d him et aIl. I have asked the
honourable leader of the Governmnent wh'it
je the reason for the chang-e. How je ;t
that what wes gold lest year is now' lead?
How je it that what was so good for the
Goverrnent to introduce lest year is so
bed to-day? I have had no answer. I arn
înclined to believe thet thev were fishing
for votes. Was it because there s a wartime election ahead lest year that the Governinent moved for this, "poor legislat,,oi7'
as it is described by the honourabie gentleman from Halifax? Was thet the reason?
WVere they fishing for votes?
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: And the. got them,
too.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE: Not ini Qucbec.
If thet je true, I cen understand that the
honoureble nieier from Hamnilton wau
correct in saying that there ivas a mob
in the other House leading the Government; thet the members of the niob were
saying to the Governrnent, "You muet do
that in order to get votes." If the henourable inember je correct, hie je net vý'rv complimentary to the Governrnent. If the pro-

325

posed clause was inserted simply because
the Government were fisbing for votes, jt
ie flot a great compliment to the Tory Government or the Tory senators, who within
twelve months are changing their mjnd and
are going to vote against thie saine clause
being- placed on the etatute book. What
does the clause propose? Simply to give
the right to a Federal court-for the Board
of Railwey C.ommissiioners je a Federal
court-to determjne whether, under certain cjrcumstances, after beering evidence,
it je just toi grant a request whjch. je made
to them. The honourable gentleman from
Hamilton, I amn eorry to say, bas elandered
the Railway Commission, and the honourable mnember from Bediford (Hon. Mr.
Pope) has done the saine thjng, in stating
that they stand here to protect the old conductors, implyin-g that -the railway board
will not protect themn and that the conductore wiil suifer injustice et their hands.
In the amendment proposed we are asking
simply that the court appointed, by Parliament shaîl decide in certain cases whether
it je just te grant an application from this
or that part.y. That je ail we esk. And
this clause, which-I cannot repeat it too
often-we ail voted for lest year, whjch
wee proposed by the then Minister of Railwaye hjinself, and approved by -the Government, je "poor legcisfttion." Sire, if that
je a fact, I can only eay thet I pity those
who ected in such a way.
Now, honourable gentlemen, it je eajd
that we are attempting to force a man Ie
speak Engili, or attempting to force a
man to eakFrench. Nothing of the kind.
But I would say in enswer to the honourable gentleman froin Antigonish (Hon. Mr.
Girroir), who stetes that those who are
sheddýingc their blood in Flanders disapprove of this resolution beceuse it might
co-inpel corne of them t. spe-ak English or
FrenchHon. Mr. GIRROIR: I neyer made that
stetement. The honoureble gentleman is
misquoting mie.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE: Thet je what I
understood.
The honourable gentleman
spoke about the war and the blood being
shed over there in Europe. I will answer
that I called attention only yesterday to
the names of 23 French Canadiens who had
shed their blood over there. And when
those heroee were taking the train to Montreel on the railway owned by the Government to go and fighit for the Empire, they
were deprived. if they could not speak

SENATE
En.glish, af tAie appor.tuility ta speak their
own language with the conductors.
1 say, furtherrnare, that there is already
on the statute book a law which compels
a man ta speak English and French. If
you refer 'ta the law ai pilotage, you will
find that no man may be a pilot in the
province of Quebec who is net able to write
and speak English. I brought that matter
up in the House a few years ago. Now, if
this is such Il poor legislation,"I or if it is
class legislation and so very bad, how is it
that lit was placed on the statute book?
The French people neyer complained about
it, for it is only fair that a man who is
going te pilot a boat from Montreal or
Quebe te the sea-an EngIisih boat, having
an English captain-should understand and
speak both languages. If an order is given
by an English captain it is only right. that
a French pilot should understand him;
otherwise -he ougrht not ta be a pilot, and
that ig provided for in the law, and I
neyer heard any comlflaint of it froni my
province.
Now, why has sa much fuss been made
about a clause whidh, I repeat, was included in the original Bill, and then taken
out of it, and which I arn only asking ta
have put back? I cannat understand it,
because the proposed clause is sa plain,
so clear, and so just, unless it is a parti
pris and it is -intended that employees on
trains in the province of Quebec, paid by
the French people, shahl fot -have ta speak
French if they do not care ta do so. If
such is the case, so much the worse for
this country. I say furthermore that a man
whao is a canductor or brakeman on a governiment railway is paid by ail the people
in this country-by the French as well as
by the Eng-lish; and the Frenchman, who
lielps ta pay hlmi ta work on the train,
should have the oppartunity, if hie is a
passeng-er, of speaking, and being under4ýood in his own langauage.
Honourable gentlemen, I put these few
facts before you. Ahl the arguments which
bave beeni affered against this proposition
seem ta be in reality very much in favour
of it, if hanaurable gentlemen who are
offering lhose arguments are in gaod faith
and have cammon sense. I think every
hanourable gentleman speaks in gaad faith,
but for the life af me I cannot understand
why -%'hat wvas good last year is so bad
this year-why what was gaad for the GovernTnent itself to propose last vear is s0
bad ta-day. I leave tlue question ta the
Hou se.

The
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
original amount in the old Acit as compensation an the slaughter of condemned animals was flxed iby etatute as folk>ws: grade
cattle, $60 per head; pigs and sheep, $15
per head. Honourable gentlemen will read-ily
perceive thât owing ta the very substàantial increase in the price oi live stock it
ils very desirable ta increasoe these figures.
Consequently we have fixed them at the
amounts stated in this section, namnely:
grade cattle, $60 te $80; pigs, etc., $15 to
$'-0; pure-bred cattie, $150 ta $250; purebred pigs, $50 ta $75.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Do these amounte
represent two-thirds ai the value of the
animal?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: You have pigs st $15
te $20 on one part ai the page, and in the
last twa lines you have $50 for eaoh head
ai cattle, and $75 for each pig or sheep.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The latter figure refers 'ta pure-bred animaIs. My
honourable friend will see that there is a
distinction drawn between them. The last
three hines provide that in the case of purebred animiais the aunouuut allowed shaîl be
$500 for each huorse, $250 for eachi head ai
cattle, and $75 for each pig or sheep. In
the other case $15 ta $20 is the valuaftion

Hon. iSir JA1MES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of Bill 13, an Act to amend
the Salaries Act and the provisions for preserving the independeuce of Parliament.
*He eaid: This Bill makes proviion for
the paymen-t of salaries to ministers administering the new dapartuients for which
provision bas already beeu muade thîs session. It aiso makes provision for the payment of the salaries of not more than. three
additional ministers, who may occupy positions analogous to those of heads of depart-'
ments witb«out the creation o! departments
as such. It aiso makes the us-ual provision
that they may accept remuneration without
disqualification under the Dominion Elections Act.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second rcading cf Bill 60, an Act to amend
the Gold and Silver 'Marking Act, 1913.
He eaid: This Bill provides that an official certificate by the -Ottawa branch o! the
Royal Mint, or by any Dominionb Government assay office in Canada, shall be receivable in evidence in any court cf cernpetent jurisdiction. In passing the Act of
1913, it *wss provided that ondly the certificate cf the Ottawa branch would be receivable in evidence. The consequence is
that the courts would not be authorized te

Hon. Mr. CLOIRAN: Honourable gentlmen, I think the Government of Canada
cannot act too severely, too strictly, or too
rapidly in this anatter. Accordiug to the
latest medical reporte of the hospitals of
England and on the Continent, a new disease has developed-a very fatal disease.
Aaording to English medical authorities
in some of the hoispitals, the disease, 'which
is caussd by -eatxing canned goods. and other
foodstuffs of a einilar kind, je something
awful. One doctor has stated that out of
eleven case& six died; and -the disease ie
aspreading. I do net lknow wheher a new
na-me has been invented. for the disease;
but it -appears that froxu the sating cf

Hon. Sir JA54F L4OUGRH3uE.

becoues affected. One doctor bas said that
the disease is net necessarily fatal, -but that
it is very dangerous.
la viefw o! this, the Government shoculd
receive svery encouragement te make the
provision in thie law reg-arding canned
goode and other foodistuf! s as etringent as
possible, and they cannot move too last
in preventing the apread od the dieaee te
tii country. Il tihe provisions of this Bill
are nlot severe enough, R think there -would
,be ne objection te the Governrmt increasing their aeverity. If foodz gron in Canada are requirsd te be inspected before
hsing put ini the cana end. labelled, how
*mach more neoessary is it -te protect the
public against foods over wbich this Government bas no control? The inspection
t)hat je made ini a foreign country may be
sufficient for that counutry or it may flot.
Evidently it is net, jud-ging from *the reaulté of the coneumption of canned goods
in England and other parts of Europe.
Hon. Mr. DO(MVIILLE: Ia this new disease infections or contagioue?

and as etringent -as possible.

~Hon. [Mr. DANIEL: Honourable gentlemnen, I think there is an omission in this
Bill, as there bas been in the Meat and
Canned Foode Act ever since Ab bas 'been
in operation. While great cars is taken
te ses that ail canned goode, meate, and
other foodz that are exported are in proper
condition, ne attempt se made te inepect

Il it is right te provide preper inspection
of meat and other food put up for expert,
there is et lest equal reason te ses that
food put up for use-among our own people
is aise inspected, and that the sanie asueunt
of cars is taken in its preparation and
everything connected with it. I do net see

(Hon. Mr. Béique) moved an amendanent to

APRIL 26, 1918
that l thought provision was made for compensation under our statute law. I have
made inquiry into the subject ,and 1 arn
informed by our Parliamentary Counsel, Mr.
Gisborne, that it is alread'y previded for
under the Exchequer Court Act. Section 20
of that Act says:

(b)Every claim, ags.inst the Crown for d-amege to property Injurtoualy affeoted by the construction of any public worlç,
IV has already been decided by ýthe
Supreme Court, noV only by one, but by
many authorities, that ample provision iis
made by law for compensation being paid
tri the owner of any property where damages
have been austained by reason of the carring out of any public work; theTefore, it is
objectionable to put the amendment in. this
Bill.
Hon. Mr. POWER- I do not feel quitc
clear on the point yet, because -the law
which the bonourable gentleman lias read
simply indicates that where a person has a
dlaim iV shall be disposed of by Vhe? Exchequer Court. The law does not provide
that the person hae a claim. The Bill we
are passing does not say that the person
ehall be entitled to compensation; then the
court is without jurisdiction. It may be, as
suggested by the leader of Vhe Oppositicn,
th at under the Expropriation Act a person
whose propemmy is damaged- or taken would
he able te recover compensation, but I do
noV think the law which the honourable
gentleman lias read cavera Vhe case.
Hon. 'Mr. \IdMEANS: 1 would like corne
information on this section. I understaud

-would be an action for damages.
Hon. Sir LIMES LOUG<HRED: This Bill
proposes that the Governmeut shahl have
aut'hority ta enter upon the bed of the river
for the purpose of carvying out any public
work. The Excheoquer Court Act mnakes

Court has held that that Act flot only gives
a jurisdiction to the Exehoquer Court to hear
the dlaim for dlamages, but that it impliedly gives a right to any one wiho thinks
he hias suffered Vo dlaim damnages. It is
then for that court 'Vo dlecide whether the
dlaim is or is not valid. It is not neces8ary to provide expressly that persons shall
have a dlaimi for compensation; that is a
question of la'w.

deals not only -with rivers, but aiea with.

My honourable friend the leader of tfhe

way to making any amendment to the Bill;
therefore 1 simply vant to empbasize the
situation so that the House may under-

stand just what is being done. Lait session
the Joint Committee of both Houss on the
Printing of -Parliament 'subsnitted their
report on the 13th of September. 1917. In
t'nat report, which vas very carefully worked
ont, under the heading of Trade and Commerce, they say:
Many reports of this department duplicate
those of the 15epartment of Customi, wasting
thousajids of dollars annuelly. Am eaÈnest endeavor muet b. made by the heads of these two
dePartments te avoid. this. It .eems to the
Committe. that the sooner ail utatistics cf the

the better It wlll be in the public Interest, and
great saving weuid be efrected.

I understand that the Bill which ve now

bringing ail the statistice of the Government under a central departmet; but, unfortunately. the Govennment do not aein
to have seen their way to adopting the firet
part ci the paragraph vhich I have just

Custoins. the report aays:

Thai report vas. brought do.wn to the
Houe and was adopted, and ai a result a
committee to deal with these enatters vas
appointed by Order lin Council..-That conimittee vas known as the Editorial Cernmittee, and two or three Orders iii Council
were passed to give them the necessary
authority. On the 23rd -of Octobe--r, 1917, this

INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES INVESTIGATION ACT AMENDMENT BILL.
THIRD READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUiGHEED inoved
the third reading of Bill 48, an Act to
amend The Industrial Disputes Investigation Act, 1907.
Hon. Mr. CLOIRAN: Before the motion is
carried I wish to lay hefore the House a
certain !statement with regard to a dispute
1-efore the Minister of Labour which, i!
this Bill is passed, might be properly dealt
with by him. The dispute is a very
grave one and may lead tc very grave consequences ail over this Dominion. The dis
pute arisesl out of -thefact that a very lixnited
num.berof the members of the police force of
the city of Ottawa desire. to forin &,labour
union and become affiliated with the labour
unions of Canada and the United Sta'tes.
Some of the men, I think some 25, did meet
and form a labour union, without consulting
the officers of the rnunicipality. When it
became known that in the police force of
Ottawa a labour union had been organized,
the Chief took immedioete action. He told
the men that they could flot serve ±wo
niasters: thev could not serve the public of
the city of O>ttawa and at the samne tinie
swear allegiance to another organization,
hiaving taken oath. that they would reserve
thecir entire allegiance for the police body
under the control and guidance of the Police
Commission, composed of His Honour Judge
-NcTavish, judge of the Criminl Court, I
understand; the judge of a iower criminal
court, Police -MagistrateAskwith, the Mayor
of 'the City, The Chief of the Police Force,
the Ci.ty Solicitor, and I think, another.
The oath of allegiance taken by the mnen in
a labour union-I ani sorry I have flot a
copy of it here-is to the effect that their
entire allegiance shiail be given to the labour
union, irespective of or against the int4erests
of any üthier organization.
Hon. '.\r. M\URPHY: Do they take an
oath to that effecCF
Hon. Mr-CLORAN: That is swo'rn. I have
lust seen a copy of the oath in the handa of
the chief of police. He offered te givemea
copy, but I hiad flot ti-me te wait, because I
thoug-lit this nmott-er would be up in the

House ýbefore I got lierre. The consitables'
oath of office is directly opposed to that. It
is in -substance: - We will truthfully, faillifully, and i.mpartially serve the interests of
the city "-that is, the interests of the municipality.
Thereupon the Minister of Labour intervened through the public press, evidently
siding with the men. We have no official
statements, but his interviews are in the
public press. The result w-as that the men
sent himi an application to establish what
la called -a board of conciliation. The police
authorities point out that such applicatÀon
is not worth the paper it la written on. It
ia not authorized by the old Industrial Disputes Act at all. In the'next place it, ia
su~bversive of most neceasa-y authority in
the community. A police force exista in
every munîcîpality-every hamlet, village
or mnetropolis of this iDominion-and il the
precedent is established in Ottawa it -will
only encourage the police forces ail over
the Dominion t-o take similar steps. The
entire police commission isa gainst any
such procedure on the part of the mnen as
the formation of a union; and they are
cer-tainly flot sat-ia-fied with t~he procedure ef
the honourable the Minister of Labour in
thia miatter. He had no authority and no
right te interv-ene between the police commission and the men; and hie has laid
down a precedent which iïs altogether opposed to the jurisprudence or the parliamentary legislation of Great Britain, as I
will show in a second. Under these c*rcumztanices the condition of things is not
one that ia beneficial either to the public
or to the men. Ais I stated last, Friday
night, there can be no objection to the
police force organizing a body of their ùwn
for their own mutual convenien-ce, their
comfort, or their pleasure; but there is an
absolute obstacle to a police force, which
after alI ie a iiilitary body, becoming part
and parcel of an organizatoïon or organizations which they may be called upon to
protect agaains-t the attacks of employers, or
against which it may be their duty as
policemen to defend employers. The police
must be a neutral and administrative body,
lîke a corps of soldiers. The soldier who
is on the flring line is of course flot neutral-he is fi ring at the enemy; but the
poslition of the policeman is a still more
difficuit one, for hie is always on the firing
line--24 hours a day, year in and year out.
He lias flot bis gun pointed at anybody
in particular, but hie points his gun at the
first person who disturbs the peace. does
harm te property or menaces the livea of

SENATE
citizens. Then he must point his gun, or
make an arrest.

is, only a year and a hall ago-the Hon.
Mr. Samuel, in the House cf Gommons.

question whether Metropolitan policemen

There is the well-defined poldcy of the
British Government, in regard to the neutrality cf its police force. Wbat aipplies, te
the police force cf London will apply ta
that cf Glasgow, or any other centre in
Great Britain; and why a miniater cf this
(iovernment should undertake ta su.bvert
this palicy, or ta replace it, by what he has

more than can be understood by ordinary
persans, or by those who are responisible

mayars, councillors, etc. Sa, if this Bill
provides that the Minister o! Labour, or
any other minister, shall have the power
and the right tao intervene lu disputes betweeu policemen and their superiors, it is
doing a grievous wrong -ta the country.
The followina -is the opinion cf emîneut
Canadian authorities:
The well-being, the protection, the ruling
power, of the State is the supreme law. The
police are the servants of the State for the
special and rnost honourable purpose of upholding the law; and the community would nat deserve the name of a State if it had not the
determined Nvill and the intrinsic power to
maintain its own authority and direct its own
instruments.

such as postmen, taxcallectors. Parliamentary

specific purpose of maintaining order and enforcing law, of doing so in accordance with legally prescribed regulations. under legally authorlsed comnmand. To suggest, therefore, that
pobioemen, are entitled ta, put theýIr beade tagether to, decide when and where and how they
should choose to obey or dieobey, would imply
that the poice are the masters rather than the
servante of the State.

will advise thern to be foolish enough te be
led away by any such blandishments.

I cannot give yau any stronger arguments
than these. 1 hope the Minister of Labour
will flot shlow this matter ta be decided by
a board of conciliation. A matter of di6pute between eoldiere would be settled by a
caiirtiartial, not by a board of conciliation.
The remarks which I miake are not intended 'ta prevent men of other tanks of
labour from oraiizing- and organizing as
thoroughly as possible. I do not want ta
prevent men of any rank from organizing,
and foTming unions; but na policeman
should take two different oaths of alleguiance,
one ta a union and the other to the police
organization. They may corne in confiict.
The oath of a policeman is ta serve the
public impartially, and te protect life and
property.
With these reinarks I leave the matter in
the bands of the House. I hope that 'the
discussion which has taken place -will have
its effect, and that we will hear no more of
police bodies throughout the Dominion -undertaking ta forni unions and becoîne affiliated or identifled witb what are properly
sud rightly known as labour organizatîons. Under the present wording of the
Act I arn not sure whetber the minister hae
the right ta intervene in disputes of this
nature. As 1 pointed out 'to the honaurable leader of the Government l.ast Friday
nigh't, the power of the minister is limited.
The provision ssys that where in any indutry a dispute ari6es, the .mfnister shail have

for a board, the minister m-ay sct of his
own volition. That provision liniits. his
power to, an industry, eand, as I pointed out
on Priday, no one in hie sane eenses will
call a police force en induetry. Another
section of -the Bill reads as followsWhenever, under thds Act, an appicaton la

SECOND READING.,
Hon.. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED -moved the
aecoud reading of Bill 38, an Act for granting to Hia Majesty aid for Military and
Naval Defence.
He said: The enormoais sum which is
proposed to be voted, snd which has been
voted ly the House of Commone, acarcely
permits of anything being said upon the
subi ect except that this amount is required
for the fiscal year upon which we have ente.red. The estimated expendýitures for the
year will amount ta about $518,00,0O0.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOC¶: That is for the
past Srear?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No, for
the present. The Bill which we are now
considering is for the year 1918-19. It is
anticipsted, though, that the actual expenditure, when mnade, may possibly came
withiin the five hundred million dollars
mentioned. The estimates of the Militia
Department represent about $217,887,500,
while the Overseas Farces estimate wil
reach $255,162,500. Inaddition, there wil
be the estimates of the variaus departments
of the Government, in cannection rwith
which war expenditures will be incurred,
making up the balance. The Government
is very desirous of securing the passage of
this Bill, at the latest to-marrow, so that
the assent of His Eýxcellency the Governor

ýGeneral may be given ta it, on accaunt af
the. moneys which were voted during the
last fiscal year having been exhausted. As
honourable gentlemen 'will o~bserve, we bave
entered upon the first month of the new
ifiscal year. it is thus rendered necessary
that at the end of this xnanth ai April 'we
ehould have supplies voted ta permit us ta
meet whatever obligations may become
payable, say to-marrow or the day alter. It
would be anly a boa of time, and would
be entirely auperfluous for -me ta enter
upon any explanation as ta the expenditures ta be made. Suffice it ta say that we
have entered upan this war. We entered
upon it in 1914., and, unfo)rtunately, the
etruggle which is canvulsing the whùle
nworld aeems ta be at its height and may
possibly continue for some time longer.
It may be of interest goahonourable gentlemen ta know what we have already voted
in connection with the war. .In 1914 'we
voted $5,000,000; in 1915,4$100,000,000; in
0116, 4$250,00,000, and -in the Bupply Bil]
of J9164i7, $50,OOO,OOO; making $3W00,OOOvoted for 1916-17. There was voted on

Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honourable
gentlemen, it is difficuit ta criticize in any
,way the eicpenditure af the enormaous aumns
that we are dealing with at the present Uime,
because af 'the difficulty of going into
any question of the details oi the expenditures. A great deal of this nioney is expended on the other 6id-e -of the Atlantic, and
it is flot easy ta get the necessary information. We ail realize that the 'Goverument
are doing the best they can in a very difficuit situation. The enarmnous sums of money that we are called upon ta vote, owing
ta the expenditure an the war, are such as
a few years ago we would not have believed
it was possible for a country with the population of Canada to raise or ta finance in
any ehape or iorm.
The desire ai al] at the pre-sent tixne is ta
do aIl that is possible ta assist iu the prosecution ai this war; but there are-certain
matters an which, if we 'were going inta cammittee on this Bill, we might ask xny honourable friend for information. Commissions have been appointed in conneétion
with the war, and expenditures have been
lncurred, on which we have not had, in this
House al, any rate, very much information,
and an which, I think, we should, either on
tbhis or en same future occasion, receive *a

of tihis Director of Public Infor7mation are,
and whs.t good abject, îhe 'le suppcîsed. ta

in the past been accustamed ta look ta out

they cauld -and what they were aflowed by
the censar ta give. At the present time,
it is of course necessary, in the interest of
the country, ta exercise a strict censarship
over ail the news published throughout the
country, and that censorship is ini the
controi of the Goverument. I presume that
not only have the censors contrai of what
the newspapers may publish, but at the
saine tiine they migtit place themn in a
position ta give certain information ta the
people if they thought it in the interest af
the country, se thst the people might be
kept posted as ta what is going on i Europe
and aiso in Canada." Elowever, flot having
any in-formatian as ta what is the actual
wark of this gentleman termed the Director
of Publie Information, it is difficut, -ta say'
whether the expenditure incurred. by 'the
Goverament thraugh. thie office is one that
is justified.
I think niy honaurable friend <Han.
Sir James Lougheed) himself irealizes that
it is the duty af ail members of bath
branches ' of Parliament ta -watch very
carefully the expenditure of the enormous
amaunt ai maney that we are called upan
ta vote for thie purpose af carrying on the
war, in order ta see that it is properly
expended. and that no unnecessary waste
or extravagance occurs in the spending af
it. This session already we -have 'been
called upon ta vote a large sumn of money
for the purposes af thie work of the Railway
Department. To the 3500,000,000 provided
for in this Bill we have t. add the $50,000,000 voted a few days ago for the railways,
and the $4,500,000 voted to the Railway
Deparbment ta increase their stores account.
Then we have the estimates as at present
brought down ta the House, which provide
for an expenditure authorized. by statute
af $95,100,000, and -the total estimates ta be
voted, 3157,692,000; making-a total of some
$807,000,000. That is an enormoue amount
af money for a country with the population
that we have ta be voting. I say again
that we should watoch very carefully ahl
the expenditure that is being made by the

A1PRIL 29. 1918
Gaovernment, and should point out any
expenditure that we think extravagant or
unnecessary. I arn sorry therefore that we
shall fot have an opportunity of discussing
this Bill in Committee, as we might get
sa-me further information from the leader
of the Govern-ment i regard ta some of
these rnatters.
I would like ta* point out to the leader of
the Government that we have been cansidering the position of the Senate with regard
to Money Bis; and,-although, at the present time, owing ta conditions in the country, and ta the fact that every one is morè
conoerned with the carrying on af the war
than%
with anything else, we do not want ta
make any trouble for the Government in
this matter, I think we ought ta enter a
proteat, maintaining our right ta consider
these Bills in Commxittee.

is therefore very desirable that there ahould

each of the nine provinces. 0f course, the
amou.nt increases from 'year te year. My
honourable Iriend did not teil us what was
the basis used in arriving at the conclusion
that $50,000 would be sufficient for this year.
Section 4 of the Bill says:
For the purposes of such organization and
co-ordination, anod. eublect to the conditions set
forth In section 7, the following sums shahl be
iappropriated and paid out of the Consolidatcd
Revenue Find of Canada durlng each fiscal

During the fiscal year beginning the flrst
d"y of Aprl, une thousan dune bunded and
nineteen, the sum of $100,000.

I presume that there was some method of
arriving at that suin; but my honourable
friend bas not given us any information as
to what it was. Possibly we may be able to
obtain that information when we go lut o
Comxnittee. I understand that this Bill is
along the Uine of legisiation that bas been
passed in Great Britain and in New Zealand, where such labour bureaus have been
in existence for a numnher of years and have
proved of advantage te -the country. It
seemis te me that the establishment cf such
bureaus would be of assistance in dcaling
with the question that we discussed the
other day--soldier's civil re-establishment.
At the present time there ie ne proper
organization that any one can apply te for
men who are capable of deung certain work
or te find out what their work was before
they jolued the army. Cemmittees have
been formed, I think, but I have found that
theY were not wchl advertiscd through the
country, and people have not known te
whom te apply te get returned soldiers who
were willing and able te do work, or te flnd
eut whether thcy would be avaihable te go. te
certain places. 1 presurne a lot of that kind
of work will be donc by these bureaus a
soon as they arc established.
The other sections of the Bill cau prebably
be discusscd a good deal better when we are
in Committee.
Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS: Henouiable gentlemen, I was very glad te see this Bill
broug-ht down, because it is a step in the
right direction; but, -after aIl, it is onhy
a step. It looks to me like an endeavour
on the part of the Governnient te shift its
respensibility on te other shoulders by paying a very sm.all amount te the provinces
each year, thus relieving iteeff cf the reqpon.sibility of mobilizing labeur during -wartime as a Federal measure. I assume that
Hon. Mr.

BOSTOC

we shall have an opportunîity of discussing
this Bill in caminittee; but I m.ay say now
that I find no provision in t.he Bill for the
maintenance of the clearing bouse te which
the leader of the Government reierred. As
f ar as I can sec, there is an amount of $50,000 te be voted, which 'will be distributed
in the following manne.r:
1The moneys approprlated for each year abalt

be allotted and pald to the Governments of the
respective provinces in the proportion which
their expenditure for the maintenance of employment offices bears to the total of the expeiturce of aL the 'provinces for euch purVoses.

There is no provision in thait clause for
the paynient of the co-ordinating Federal
branch at Ott.awa, and, after ail, il this
measure is going te be of any great value.
it is essential that there should be co-ordination.
I do not want to diseuse this measure at
any great Iength. It is a step in the right
direction, but it looks to me very like
camouflage; and, unleas it is t.aken hold of,
as I tried te point out laut week, in a
strong, earnest, and courageous manmer,
such hegisiation -as t.his will -have no effeot.
Hon. Mr. POWER: I think the honourable gentleman who bas just sat do-wn bas
probsbly hit the bull's eye. This ie really,'
I think, just a tub thrown te the whale.
There is no question as to the desirability
of having such an organzatiooâ as is provided for here, or as should be provided for
in thjs measure; but j1 do not think the
messure is going te have ve.ry rnuch effect.
0f course, the Bill can be discussed in
comnsittee; but there are one or two points
to which it nay be well -te direct the attention of the Government before it reaches
that stage. I cahi -attention te section 5,
which reads ini this way:
The xnoneys 3%Pprcprlated -feor cadi

offices by such province.

In addition to what iny honourable friend
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Nicholis) bas said,
under that clause, as Ïhonourable gentlemen
wiil aee, ne pro'vincaý can form any clear
idea of how much -is likely te 'be paid to
that province under the operation of this
Bill. Surely there ie sufficient ingenuity
in the Government te provide that a certain

shall be paid te each of th-e provinces, and

As wae well said by the honourable gentleman ifrom Toronto, there is noe doubt that
a Federal employ.ment bureau' and subsidiary branches is highly desirable in ordeT
ta take this work out of the hands of the
graïfters 'who fleece the general public snd
labourera who are aeeking employment; but
ta my mind the Bill is too general. It aima
st something and lande with nothing. In
the Maritime Provinces theire is no auch

ta be made on the basis of the expenditure
of the province for such bureaus. As was

BILL.

SECOND READING.

Hlon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of Bill 63, an Act to amend
the Fisheries Act, 1914.
. He said: Honourable gentlemen, this is
very largely a matter of departmental
regulation. It deals particularly with the
protection of salmon in British Columbia
waters -and the licensing of fishermen in
-boats. Probably one of the more important
features of 'the Bill is the prohibition
which is being placed upon fishermen froni

the catching of fish is lorbidden in those
water~s. This provision is flot intended to
oome into operatio'n until a like provision

is adopted by the Goverinent of the United
States. These are the chief provisions in
the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: This Bill, as my
honourable friend has said, deals in section
3 with the question of fishing in British
Columbia. I do not undersand why this
clause is introduced. Up to the present
time the fishermen in B3ritish Columbia
have had a license for fishing on the coast,
a certain number of lfcenses having been
supplied to the canneries and others to
individual fishermen. That, as I underatand, la -the policy whieh has been followed
in years gone by, and I believe it is
also the policy in force at the present ti.meý
The honourable gentleman from Westmiueter <Hon. J. D. Taylor), whorn I do niot see
in the House, probably has better information about this mater than I have. But
under section 3 of the Bill some new forin
of license seenis Wobe provided. I 'do not
know whether or flot the Goveru ment
bas .found that there is some objection to
allowing persons to go ont and fish for
sabînon in the waters of British Columbia
and seil their fish afterwards. It would
seeni that section 3 is aimed at prohibiting
that.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It aims at
an abuse very largely indulged in by the
unlicensed
Indians. They self their fish Wo
boatmen, who seli them to the caunexs,
and Bo on.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: But I have always
understood that the Indians, are licensed
just the sanie -as t~he ot.her fishermen.
H 1on. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Mr. BOtSTOCK: There have been
iHon.
Indians and Japanese -and white men carrying on the flsh.ing at the mouth of the

Hon. Si JAMES LOUGHEED: I refer
particularly to fishing in the closed season.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: lt is not conteniplated making any:alteration in the fishing
regniations to allow persons to catch fis'h
out of season?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No. This
section particularly affects those boatmen
who may not have a license and wfho may
buy fish that have been illegally caught.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I was try-ing to
point out that, as 1 understand,'ail persons
engaged in fishing have heretofore had a

Hon. Mi. BOSTOCK: Of cour-se, as My

understand, tihe Governinent in England get

when any gold -or silver marking is put
on that -it shall be done by the goldsmith
company or the representatives of the Goïernment.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Yes, but in this
country we have adopted a different practice apparently. The principle in tliis
country apparently is that the sihversmiths
and goldsmiths are allowed to put on a
mark, and then the 'Government have an

that the marking is false. I asked my

*WOMEN'S ELEOTORAI FRANCHISE
BILL.
SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of Bill 3, an Art to confer
the Electoral Franchise upon Women.
He said: The object of tbis Bill is to
conter the electoral franchise upon women.
It purposes amendingl the Dominion Elections Act, 'thus placing women upon an~
equality with men in the exercise of the
franchise. There is not much difficulty
in applying the provisions of the Bill to
those who are born British subjeets. Very
naturally, owing to the large foreign population living in Canada, At has become
necessary te work eut rather elaberate provisions and restrictions as te the exercise of
the franchise by women who are foreigners
either through biîth, marriage ci otherwise.
We have on the statute-book at the present
time two Acts which have te do 'with the
Bill before us, namely, the Dominion Electiens Act and the War-time Elections Act.
As honourable gentlemen know, the latter
Act vwa& pas6ed last session, and automatically cesses, to remain in force or opera-

APRII, 29, 1918
,tion alter the demobilization of our troops
takes place. Upon that time being rqached
-1 hope it will not be far distant-,we*wilI
have to deal only 'with the Dominion Elections Act, of which this proposed Act will
practically -be a part. It Bseems to me that
every condition has been fairly safeguarded
in this Bill, so as to prevent the exercise
of the franchise by foreigners who possibly
might be alien enemies. .This condition
could flot arise while the War-time Elections Act remains in force. The restrictions embodied in that Act vould necessarily become incorporated in this Act, and
that Act would be broadened ta the extent
to which provision ie made in this Act,
that is to say, the new c!ass af voters to
whom the franchise has been or under this
Act will ha extended, could exercise their
franchise under the War-time Elections
Act. The restrictions of that Act as ta naturalized subjects tàsqualified from voting
wou!d automnatically corne into aperatian
under that Act. Hence we have ta consider what the application of thiâ Act will
ha ta the Dominion Elections Act rather
than to the War-time Elections Act. It
seems to me that the situation is so salegu.arded under the War-time Elections Act
as ta remove from our minds ail apprehension as. to the braadening of the franchise,
as pravided for in this Bill. Consequently
the attention ai honourable genrtlemen wil
poasibly be directed ta furnishing ithose
safeguards which are sa necessary, particularly at the present time and for sane, years
ta follow, to prevent the exercise ai the
franchise by any class of foreigners who
would not be in sympathy with British
institutions. In drafting this Bill the
Governinent feit that they had iully protected the situation w.hich I have just
pointed out. We cannot ha too cautiaus
in safeguarding the exercise af the franchise
in Canada so that we m-ay ha assured it
will ha exercised anly by those who. are
loyal ta aur institutions.
I need scarcely say that there has always
heen mare or less prejud'ice an the part ai
a very large section ai the cammunity
towards extending the franchise ta women.
We sometimes digniiy aur prejudices by
terming thern opinions; but, alter ail, mast
of the opinions which we forin an general
sqbjects are really the resuit ai prejudice
or sympathy, as the case may ba. We
arrive at conclusions or opinions an nearly
every great subject in cansequence ai aur
environ-ment, or the associations which
exercise mare or less influence upon aur
minds, and we are ever slow ta acknow-

357

ledge that aur conclusions are the result pf
symnpathy or prejudice.
R.t must be conceded that, entirely irrespective of anadyzing the subjeot in its many
phases, a large section of 'the public have
a predispased judgment upan this subject.
It may be conceded. that the Goveiinment
has been somewha± premature, in îutroducing this meas-ure.
I need not point out thdt
the question ai according t<> women equahity
with men ini the exercise of the franchise
bas iargely if nat altagether passed the
academice stage. It is no longer a theory;
it. is a matter ai practical politics. It has
been long introduced inta the state. In no
less than forty cauntries or etates in Europe
and in America -the franchise bas been
extended ta women, more largely in AnglaSaxon cauntries than in any ather. This
franchise bas been granted in saine twelve
or fitéen states ai the Acmerican union and
in many ai the states ai Europe; and all
the evidence is that ere long the exeroise
ai the franchise by women will be as universal as that by men.
Very strange At is ta us, when we
came ta conaider it, that -for centuries,
waman bas been asserting
her right
ta. recognition by the state. We need
not go
back
ta
those centuriesthey are not manîy-when warnen were
recognized aimply as chattels, 'where they

the Dominion o-f Canada I Vink five of the
provinces have gran'ted the franchise ta
women and pl&ced theim upon an equality
wilth men. In fact, in my own province twe
niembers of the legisîsiture are women, and
in the province of British Columbia there
is a fem.ale member of the legis]ature.
Thus it cannot býe ad, bonourable gentlemen, thst tlhe Dominion ocdCanada, iu extending Ithe franchise 'to women by this
Bill, is sidopting enything unique, or is
prermature, or éhows any disposition ta
pioneer 'tii very ïnportant question. We
are simp.ly follo'wing iu the wake of the
provinces. It seema ta me iLhat the Federai1
Govern-ment is not doing omore than we are
practically compelled te do; for iît must
become quiîte obvions ta honourable gentlemen that it would be very inconsistent ta
extend the Dominion franchise ta women
in -certain of the provinces of Canada, as
we - are bound ta do in those *provinces
where tihey exercise the franchise, and ta
witbhold thsit fr-andhise in *.he other provinces of the Dominion. It goes without
saying that fihere should necessari-ly be
uniformity- on .thd.s very important subjeet.
En'tirely apart ifrom tihes'tatements whidh
I have already made as te other states

financial affairs of the state as men them,selves. At the present time, in this war
which has precipitated devastation and
bloedshied tihroug-hout the civilized world,
we find woman taking bier place *as conspicu<iusly -and as usefully as Rnan himself.

t.his class of service will, become even
greater. Bo, if woman is qualifled to enter
the learned professions, to occupy in the
world of coommerce and finance as conspicuous a position as that of man, to take
bier part in the struggle which is convulsing
the whole of civilization and perform duties
as hazardous as those of men, exhibiting
the seme gallantry and beroismn as are being
s'hown by men, no one can say for' a moment that we should withhold from bier the
exercise of the franchise.
On these grounds, honourable gentlemen,
I think it goes without saying that this
measure is one whieh not only should be
accorded ta woman at the present time, but
should have been'accorded ta hier long
since. Under these circumâtances, I have
very gre-at satisfaction in moving the second reading of this Bill.
Hon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honour-able
gentlemen, I have listened with a kreat
deal of interest ta the remarks of my
honourable friend the leader of the Government on thîs- matter. He bas gone very
fully into the history o.f the enfranchisement of women down to, tihe present time.
I do not think it ia necessary for me ta say
any more ini tAiat -respect. We ail realize
tihe important part that women are playing
to-day in the work of the world, not only ini
connection with work at the front and
other war-work, but also in every other
walk .of life. Women to-day are taking a
much more prominent and active part than
they bave done in the past.
My honourable friend bas inet gone very
ful.ly i!nto this Bill. 1 bave eome criticipni
to make of the way in 'whih this Bill ia
Ibrought dowu at the present time. I do not,
nyisef see the neceseityo f dealing 'with
this miatter just now, especially as in one
of the clauses, of the Bill it is provided thýat,
in the event of there being sucb a thing as
au eleetion before the Tht of January, 1919,
the lMats Vhat a-re 'te be u6ed are those wbîch

the Goverument is net in a hurry te give
the ladies the, vote, in case there may be
a by-election.
The question cf the franchise is. one that
bas bee'n fought eut from the tiane of Confederation diown ta the present. The question bas been whether there should foe what

voting. In years gone by, when people had -a
considerable struggle to attain the franchise,
the rnajority of the voters appreciated the
value of their votes; but I fear that at the
present time throughout a great part of
thiýs Dominion, there are a number of
people who are entitled to vote under our
election laws who do flot really appreciate
the value of that vote. They do not realize
what the effect of their vote is, or whaît a
prîvilege it is te be able to, take a part ln
the goverýnmenit of their country, and te say
whom they will send te represent them
either in the provincial legislature or in
the Dlominion Parliament. The difficulty has
always been to find a proper means of
testing the qualifications Ôf an electer. But
1 think it would have been very much better
for the tGovernmnent te have take n this
whole question into consi-deration. I 'quirte
realize that under present conditions we
have a gréat many other things te consider.
1 therefore regret that the Government has
seen fit to deal with this matter now, and
1 very much regret that they are dealing
with it by an Act which will affect the whole
Domnion, and will give the franchise te
womaen in provinces where I do not conaider they have worked for it. The agitation
for wome.n's franchise hias been worked up
in provinces where they have the vote at
the presenit time because a large number
of the women considered thati they were
entithl to it, and were anxious about it.
But there are soine provinces in this
Dominion where I do 'not think the women
have considered this matter te, any great
extent, and where I do not tLhink they are
at ail anxious to receive the vote. The
Government is practically giving them something that they do not want; and therefore
they may not value it at ail. The women
will be put in the position of receiving
something that they do noV appreciate, and
consequently very probably they will notexercis-e their right to vote.
,One of the great drawbacks te our franchise system is t.hat individuais do not
appreciate the vote as I thin-k they ought
te. The percbrntage of votes that ought to
he recorded ait the time of an election are
not recorded. Statistics show that in those
portions of the world where the women have
taken an active part and have shown their
desire for the franchise, when they have
received it they have taken more i.nterest
in the casting of their votes than the men.
But when the noveity has worn off, and
they find that the holding of a vote has

the eame extent -as even the men have doue.
I think, therefore, that in the case of thoose
provinces where the women have not ehown
a desire te obtain the vote, the probability
is, even whien they receive it under this
mneasure which. the Governmient has brought
down, Vihey will not go to the poils, and the
advantage of giving themn the -vote will to
that extent be lost.- Under the War-tîme
Elections Act provision was made whereby
a certadn nurnber of women, throughout the
country, having certain qualifications, were
given the vote; and, on the whoie, in those.
cases I fancy that a very large percentage
of the vote was polled. But the vote at the
last election war. given under a considerable
deareè 04f, I xnay 9ay, excitement, and people
were very mûch woxked up over the situation t.hat then prevailed. Therefore I do not
think the vote then given would. be a fair
smple of wh.at we may expect on another
occasion. The whole que-stion, is one that
requires careful consideration, and I should
have much preferred to have seen the
Goverment coneider the whole question of
the qualifications of -voters thoughout this
country, and te have left, this matter ci
eîtending the franchise te woxnen until a
future day, exoept in those pro'vinces
where, under the law of the provinces, thev
now are entitled te vote.
-1on. -Mr. A.-BOYER - Honourable gentlemen, the question of votes for women is as
o.lds the world. Prohibition existed in tlhe

Arid now we come to the great days ot the
,ýuffraL-ettes. If we hiave not heard of the
suff ragettes, we have read about them. Whilb
living in London in 1911, every Sunday
I made it a point te go to the foot of Nelson's
monument in Trafalgar Square, where the
suff ragettes hei-d forth. 1 am not a lady's
man by any means; but if they want the,
vote, and if they won't be happy tili they
guet it, let them have it; but I may say
that they convinced me that they shouid
not get it.
I remember one Sunday witne.ssing one
of the saddest sights that I could possibly
be present at. An elderly lady with a lovely face, groomed as al! English women are,
wes raised te Vhe platform, and she etarted
and heid forth. In front of ber stood a
good-faced old Engalishman with a long
white -beard. Fie was continuaiiy laughing
at this lady. She got excited during the
argument: llrst, one hairpin camne out,
and a smaîl loc1, of bier bair fell doýwn.
Tien she made another big imove, and
another bairpin came down, until tbey all
came down, and for -ail the worid she looked
like one o! the wiV.cbes in Macbeth. Thiat
convinced me that if ever we gave women
Vhe rigbt to vote, and -they came on the
hustings, the best thing- tbey could wear
%vas a net, so as to avoid sucb accidents.
But to come back te my old friend who
stood ini front of this lady and disapproved
of everything she said. At iast, as a final
argumecnt, she asked him. "You don't believe in votes for -%vomen?" He said, "Ne."
Then she looked at hlm a8 cross as possible
and said: -"Sir, if I vwere your wife 1 would
poison x-our tea." And wh.at do you tbink

,Well, on this question of the vote for
women, why not give it ta them? They
were carried away in the election of November list by the word "union." It had a
great effect on them. They thought, you
know. that this marriage of Liberals and
Canservatives was a great union, and they
voted for it en masse, being allured ta it by
the word "union." They thought it would
be a great thing. But I arn very much
afraid. as Mr. Gladstone remarked in one
men,
of his speeches against the vote for w9*
"They are so impressed that whoever can
influence them, will carry the day." This
ha happened with us' once; but let us be
liberal; let us give them what the Government has promised it would do, and in this
I see only future misery for the Government, because having first tasted of the
vote, the women 'will inquire frorn this
identical Union Government, "Why don't
yau rgive us the right ta sit bath in the
Senate and the Hanse of Commons?" As
my old French author said, "«Ever mince
then there has been no rest, neither for
God nor for man." The day they get the
vote there will. be no rest for any Government that is in power until they ket the
right ta sit in bath Houses.
Hon. Mr. POWE2R: I rise ta speak now
juat because I 'have given notice af an
ameudment. Honourable gen'tlemen will
realîze at what disadvantage I arn speaking,
following my honourable friend. from Rigaud
(Hon. Mr. Boyer). I cannot say anything
as interesting or poetical or amusing as t.he
things he has said. With respect ta the
question cd wamen voting, 1 do not propose
ta say anything.. My amendinent does not
deal with that part of the question at ail,
but is really a sort of prelimina-ry amendment, so ta say, ta the'efiect that this
measure whidh deals with the franchise
ehauld be left with the variaus provinces
instead of being, introduced hexe. I arn
not goifig ta discuas the subject at any
length.
lhonourable, gentlemen will bear this in
mînd-and I noticed that in a reportirfrom
one of aur conmittees, of which the honourable gentleman from. Middleton (H-on. W.
B. Rosa) îs chairman, there is 6ome reference ta the principle that one af the chief

363

abjects in creating tihe Senate and making
it the body that it is, as expressed by the
gentlemen iwho were concerned in framing
aur constitution, was that the Senate should
pratect the interests of the provinces. I
think that in the present instance the Government are going out of their way ta interfere, vith the rights of the provincial
legisilatures. In the Un.ited States the constituticm itself provides that the f ranchise
for the House of Representatives shall be
the same as-that for the State Legisiatures.
That was the practice in Canada from 1867
to 1885. In the latter year a measure was
introduceà which made a change, and under it tihe Dominion took charge of the electarai idats. There was a gzeat fight over
that in tihe session of 1885; but the 1.aw
continued in aperation until 1896. That law,
under which the revising barrister wae the
mnoat canspicuans figure, was repeaied aiter
the change af Government ini 1896, an.4 froxn
thiat. year until 1911 *we went Qn the same
generai principle as the United States: the
vetera at Dominion elections were thase
who were entitlled in the several provinces
ta vote for members of tihe provincial legislatures. The law under which we worked
up ta 1911 is faund in Ohapter 6 af the Revised Statutes. I think the honaurable
leader of the .O .ppisitian read the particular
section which deais with the matter. That
1&w an the whale worked satisfactorily,
thaugh t:here may have ibeen abuses in
sonie parts et tihe country. You cannot
make a.ny human law which. will nat be
abused in certain cases; but an the wbole,
under the provincial franchise systexn, the
will of the people prevailed, and that is the
main point.

SENATE
War-time Elections Act. I ar n ot going to
discues that measure; but there is just this
aibout it, that it ,beetowed the franchise on
severai thousands of persons who were flot
qualified to vote at provincial elections, and
it took away the vote from other thousands.
1 do flot proposed to discuss that War-tirne
Elections Act further than to say that it
could not have been passed in any provincial legisiature in the country, because
the voters of a province have a much
keener eye on the doings of their provincial
legisiature than they have on the doings
of this Parliament, and because the representatives are anxious flot ,to lose the
-respect and confidence of their neigbibours.
The Bill before us is unnecessary, for the
reasons given by my honourable friend on
my right (Hon. Mr. Bostock). Further, it ds
unnecessary because the War-time Elections Act covers elections up to the
demdbiliza-tion o~f our armies, wMcih is flot
likely io take place for some time, judging
frorn the character of the news we get from
the war front; so that this action is premature. If the amendment I propose is
adopted, there is no necessity for this Bill
at ail, because ail the provinces except
three have given or are giving women the
rigbt. to vote. I understand that the
province irom which I corne has passed a
Bill in favour of - female suffrage. It i.s
almost impossible t-o tell how this Bill is
going ta work out. One of the remarkable
features of the War-time Elections Act was
the maniner in which it flot only allowed
the soldier to vote, but also bis mother and
his wife; and if hie had half-a-dozen sisters,
iA allowed eIl bis sisters te vote. One
would think that that was enough. But
thit Bill before us, which it may be supposed will run on ail fours with the Wartime Elections Act, prc>vides that-a Snarried woenan or an unmarried daugbker
living with her father or mother shali be deem-

ed to havé any necessary qualification as to
property or income if the husband or either of
the parents is so qualifled.

-the -suif nage does not require the saine qualifloationýs as are required for a man; and, the
truth is that the man is in a position as
hu-miliating as that of the man mentioned
by the bonourabie gentleman from Rigaud
(Hon. iMr. Boyer).
1As I say, this Bill is unnecessary; it is
a violation of the principle upon which we
conducted our elections for a great many
years; it is gem-g te involve confusion and
expen se; and I think that the correct thing
is te avoid ex-pense and dissatisfaction by
Hon. Mr. POWER.

providing that when the War-time Electiens Act expires the provision of chapter
6 of the Revised Statutjes shall come into

amendment of which I gave notice, -sec6nded
by Hbln. Mr. Farrell, as follows:
That the said Bill be flot now read a second
time ; but that it be resolved :
That for the purposes of any Dominion .election held within the limii.s of a province, the
voters' iists shahi be those prepared for the
several' polling divisions, and which. on the
sixtleth day next preceding the day fixed for
the nomination of candidates for such Dominion election, were in force, or were hast In

th-at this legisiation is not, calculated to advance the best intere6ts either of the nation
or of the home.- I am flot going to resort
to abuse on this question. I am speaking
from -a high standard of morality and of
obedience te divine la-w. 1 will flot even
call it Christian *morality. because the
divine l.aw existed before Christianity was
eetaJblished; Chriatianity came on earth
onqy te corroborate, endorse and emphasize
tihe divine la-w. I this legisiatiori we are
violating both the divine law and Ch.ristian
morality. We are putting into the family
the brand of discord. Discord imust neces-,

'The honou.rable leader of the Governnient almost apologized for the introduction of thisBill at thie late hour, saying
that the Governmnen4 clid not prescrit it
prematurely. WeLl, allow nae to tell the
Government, and the honourable leader of
the Governmenit in this Houee, that it is a
bela'ted measure, it ie flot preniature.
Wheu the Government undertook, ninoe
months ago, during the session of 1917, to
grant the franchise to the mother, te the
xnother-in-law, to the aunt, to the sisiter or
sters, of the aoldier. they should have
granted it te wôimen who would be le6s interested in the vote and more competent to
vote. Why did t.he Governmnent of that day
refuse to Lady - Bord-en the right to vote?
Why did the Governiment of that day refuse to Lady Laurier the right to vote? To
Lady Foster? To Lady Flavelle? 1 could mention if, I had the volume be!fore me, thousands of women who were refused the ig'ht
to vote, while iît was given to women who
wereno more fi~t to vote than a common sohool
echild, because they knew nothing of the
politics of the country. All they knew was
what the canvasser or the enurnerator told

you will get a bigger allowance. You çwill
be sure of an allowance.. Vote for the
Union Government anid your son, or your
brother, will be allowed home on f-Lrlough."
What I amn stating here I arn stating as

Its name was defamed by the atrocieus acta

nothing but a petticeat groverniment, unduly
frocked--.that kind of Government cannot
tand, especially in a country like Canada.
I hold that this legisiation cannet be productive of any beneficial result.
I admit aîl that bas 'beeu aaid .by the
leader of -the Government in regard te the
tremendous work perforzned. by the wo'men
of Canada, the women of the Empire-in
f-act, the woenen af the world; 'but that wo'rk
will not jusitify a Governinent in creating

Under these circuinstances, I f ail to set

There is ample time to. coneider it. This
is a measure of vast imnportance to tht

Hon. L. MeMEANS:- Honourable gentlemen, at this stage of the debate I -do flot
intend to take any part in the discussion
of this measure; but the honourable genitlemani who has just resumed bis seat (Hon.
Mr. Cloran), if my hearing is correct, made
the statement that the women of Canada
were bribed to vote in favour of Union Goverriment-that they were induced to vote
for it by the promise that larger pay would
be given to their hushands, their brothers
anid their sons, and that they would be
brough home to them.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: That is true.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Lest it go uncballeriged ini this House, 1 desire to state that
the -statement is a gr'atuitous insult te tht
noble women of Canada who sent their sons
to tht front.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: It may be gratutitous,
but it is true..
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I tell the honourable gentleman it is not true, and 1 stand
here and say to him 'that when he makes
that statenient he le stating- what ia absolutely unýtrue. 1 tell tht honourable gentlemani that he should go into the West, into
the city of Winnipeg, and set the work and
the devotion of those noble women in the
great cause. I can tell him instances of
women in 'Winnipeg, living on very smal

amounts, who refused -to take ont dollar
from the Patriotic Fund because they
thought the Patriotic Fund would need it.
Dots the honourable gentleman tell me that
women whose sons have fought and died in
the trepches could be bribed by anybody
to send to tht -men lin tht trenches tht help
and the reinforcernents which they wexe
seeking? If he wants. to know why tht
women voted for Union Government, I will
tell him. Il was so that those boys should
not be deserted-that they should receive
reinforcemtnts in tht name o f Canada, but
the honourable gentlemen on the other aide
vroted that reinforcemerits. should not go.
Let me tell hlm further, that when tihis
great war is over, anid when future bistorians have 'written dowri tht acte of this

on tht Military Service Bill and on tht

of the Tories were recruited frorn arnong

,would Vhose honourable shadoe say were

such legislation is .actually propound-ed. It
is fathered by the Unionist party, and
foster4.athered Iby 'what wae once upon
a time the great Liberal party. The Torres
Vedras imes 'beh'ind which we poor men
thought ourselves - ecure, are about to b>e
shattered by what has no doubt been
invented by modern culture--womanhood
suffrage. When this Bill has become law,
we, the stronger sex, will be brushed aside,
or rather, we -will be delivered into the
hands ai the irnild Epex; and, just as Samson
was shorn of his strength by Delilah, and
sent ta tumn a grindtone, sa shall we be
cast aside and sent ta the kitohiens, passibly ta the backyard-s to saw wood, or we
rnay be allowed the privilege ai the nursery

#Honourable gentlemen no doubt infer

will, have be-en changed, and possi'bly the

lot with the ladiesl, although, I must confess it is with somne misgiving, and will give
my vote and support the Bill that is before us.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If I had ha
a share of respon.sibility in the framing of
this Bill, I confess that I would perhaps
have 8topped half way, and that I wo4ild
have first allowed the provinces where women are already entitled te vote to use
their own provincial lists, 'with the conviction that the evolution -would have proceeded very rapidiy and would have covered the provinces that are yet without
woman suffrage. But the Bill is with us,
granting t.he euffrage to ail wornen of Can.
Ida.
Events are passing so rapidiy that we view
tii legisla'tion -wilihout surprise. For the
last twenty years we have seen in Great
Britain a campaign earried odi by the women suffragists. I for one felt that that
country, from which we often take our in,.
spiration and legisiation, 'would first lead
the way; but a.pparently Canada is destined
to iead the. mother country in this matter,
although we are flot ieading ail parte of
the Empire, for Australia and New Zealand
have women suffrage.
I intend te approach the eolution of this
problem by siniply asking myself the question, have wornen a right te the suffrage?
If the answer is in the affirmative, then the
draw-backs which we rn'ay see or fear -should
not impede our way. I have always feit
that wornan had an equaliînterest 'in the
wel.fare oif the state; that she was as
capable as the average elector of expressing
her opinion upon the affairs which are sumitted to the electorate every four years.
For that reason I have always been disposed .to s.ay that if women wanted the vote,
wanted to express an opinion with the men
on national matters, it was n~t our part te
deny them the exerci-se of tha-t right and
priviiege. This .beîng my opinion, it is useless to discuss at length wha-t effect that
vote may have upon the family and the
whole community. I recognize the right of
women to exercise that furiction if they
warst te do so. It mnay have some perturbing effects in the farniy circle, and sometimes a damaging effect, generally speaking, electorally speaking, in bringing the
wornen down into the electorai pit.
Now, the question is, do the women want
the vote? Speaking at ail events for that
S-24

369

part of the country which. I represent here,
I arn unable to answer that the majority
want the vote. Is there even a inajority in
ail the provinces which have women suffrage who would go te the poil on a referenduma and vote for extending the suffrage
to women? I arn noit in a position to say,
for no sudh referendum. has ever been taken,
and we must dec-ide for ourselves te-night.
I -have sometimes asked snyself -whether such
legisiation ehould not be preceded by a general referendum througho ut the country,
aaking the womien te corne te -a Poil and express their opinion e.s te stheir desire to vote.
There is no question, however, that a
very respectable minority among the-wornen
have beeu heard in Canada, as in England, i faveur of the suffrage. We rnust
concede that that rninority comprise the
elite among -wornen. In that group you
will find most of the better-educated
women and most of the university 'women.
Ali forward movernents have been led by
saal groups, and rnostly by inteliectuals.
In Quebec the group of women agitaters
has perbhaps bé-en arnaller than in any
other part of Canada, and the call for
wornen suffrage bas heen less pronounced
arnong the French Canadian wornen; but
I must admit that some prominent
wornen among them have joined the movement. Aithough few in the province Of
Quebec have asked for the vote, a very
large masjority are àkenl4y interested -in
political and electorai que-stions-, and I arn
convinced that the vast mnajority of the
wemen in my province will vote ats inteliigently as thair hushands have doue
in the paiet.
Now, we may put to ourselv 'es the question: will there be any pronounced change
in the country through the extension of
the suffragae te -woxnen? Wili there be anY
pronounced change in the politics which
-wili lie adopted by the State? I hardly
believe it. We miust ail re-oognlize that
the judgment or verdict of the people is
not always infall-ible; yet we ail recognize
and admit the superiority of a democratic
over an autocratie system: fir-at, hecause
the people. being masters of, their destinies,
are those who- take the consequences of
their actions; and, second, because they
can periodically pass judigment upon their
representatives. The demiocratie system is
not perfection, and will not bring infallible
leg-isiation; hut for ail those who have reand
history, and who are looking at events
asl they pass, there seems te be no question
that the democratic system is the hest that

order to assert the importance of our «respective policies, it seems to me that we
should make a purer and better atmosphere,
by introducing proportional representation
and thus seuring the representation of
minorities.
There is another measure which I have
always advocated, tbat of compulsory voting, but whdeh I think will have to be adjourned indpfinitiely now that women will be
on the list, for many years will pass before

for after-war conditions, whioh I consider
very essential at the present tiine. Ail the
other nations of the Allies, and also those
nations with which we are st war, are
making strenuous preparatioüs, to take care
of conditions as they rnay ccur after peace
is declared; but, se f ar as I have heen -able

to ascertain, ýnothing has really been accomplished iu Canada.. It is tru 'e that the
Government of -the day are a very ibusy
Governanent. They have been doing good
and f aithful vork; but, aiter all, it ia essential that they ahould attend to every
aapect of public affaira th-at 'may côme up
for'consideration., -and I feel-and I thinkthis flouse will feel--that as the represent.
atives of the people they are obligated, hnsy
or not busy, to give proper attention to
every phase of the economic situation,
which may have much to do with the -future
wellare of this counutry.
I suppose luhst such a question. cornes properly under the conlirol of the Depax'tment
of Trade and Commerce, and yet 1 have
been unsble tc asoertain that any definite
or constructive action bas *been 'Laken.
Last year, ini discuasing the matter wiLh
the honourable the Miniater, of Tradéend
Commerce, I was told Lh.ut -he had under
contemplation -the cal-ling together cf a
considerable body cf the foremoms business
men snd thinkers in 'Canada to study gbhe
whole situation, and that eut of that large
delegation a amaller one migbt be sel1ected
tc advise with hlm as to the adoption of a
policy 'that wouldi taire care, or at ail evenit
endeavour tc 'Lake care, cf. the situation as
it might exist at a time when we in common. with every other nattion would be engaged in the ecramble for after-war business.
6o far as 1 arn avare, Canada la the only
country that has paîd no attenfion tc this
question. 1 consider it very vital, because,
unless some policy is adopted, our unpreparedness is going te be a eerious menace

to our national wellbeing. I think our expcits during the hast three years have increased $1,5W0,000,000 over the exporta of
the previous three years. Nearly the whole
of this vast volume of trade has been ex-

ported for war purposes, at high prices.
The farmer and the-producer have received.
the higbest pricea known in history; the
wage-earner has obtained the highest wages
known in history; and the manufacturer,
the wýholesaler and the financier are making

larger

profits

than

teen obtained. That is all very well. We,
are passing through a'period cf great prosperity, and therefore va 'have been able

to -assume the burden to which we have had
t.- subinit on account of war expenditures.
*It wa-s only at yesterday's session of the
House that we passed in very short order
a budget of $&XJ,OWO0 for war expenditure for Canada alone for the current year,
w'hich me-ans at least the sum of $30,000,00O
in interest for this year's war expenditure.
We are quite able te take care of that -at
the present time, because, as I have pointed
out, we are pawsing through a period
u! great prosperîty, and we have the warprofits tax, the income tax and various
other 'measures te enable us te raise the

that -are net existent; you cannetprofits
tax incomes that have become shrunken.
If we have no prosperity in1 this country,
me shall net have the wherewithal either
to raîse addîtional revenue ior to pay the
interest on the exrpenditures that have already been -made.
Therefore, honourable gentlemen, I repeat, I -make no apology for calling the
attention of this honourable House to the
utter*supinenese of the authorities li making no0 preparation for taking care o!
the serions condition' with which we
shall be faced. I arn mot a pessimist;
I arn mot an alarmiet. I arn a born
optirniet; but' nevertheless I hav e no
hesitation in saying that we may look forward to being confronted with a period of
reconstruction which xnay be very serious
'in its financial aixpect to this country.
We mus't make an effort te replace the vaet
volume o! business which we are now en'joying with other bus-iness3 alter the war is
ended. Individual effort will accomplîsh
a great deal; but the Government of the
country are suppose&; te conserve the prosperity of the country, and it is up to thein
to take 'the first step. They are the leaders, and they will find that if they lead,
ihe business -and other -interests will foilow.
jLast year the Senate unanimously adopted
a recommendation to the Geverninent iii
connection with trade matters; they adopted
the report of the Special Committee on
the Conservation o! Trade. I arn not aware
whetber that report bas reeeived any cotusideration. I have no doubt that the hionourable leader o! the Government will iiiform the House in answer Io question 1.
Earlier than that a f ar more importani
comanittee was appointed, the Economic
Commission, of which. tihe honourable leadei
of this House was Chairman, and li whiel
he was aided by very able coadjutors.
have not heard o! any report having beer

nmade by that -commission, which was. appointed li 1916. 1 have every confidence,
and this House and this country have
every confidence, in the honourable leader
of this House to push through anything
which he undertakes. Therefore the country looks forward with a great deal oi interest for the report of the Economic Commissien, because we hav e feit that public aff airs
would be treated, by that commission in
a thoroughly judicial and compreiexisive
way, and that recommendatiofe 'would be
made, which, if followed, by the Government, would be productive of great resuits.
The honourable gentleman -will no doubt
tell u& presently whether that commission
bas reported. If so, what has becorne of
the reportV If it bas not, then -why-not?
I think it is a very important question;
and I can hardly discuss thÈ report, or
the lack of -it, until I receive a reply to
the question on the Order Paper as to what
has been done in that matter. If thle commission has made any report, or if 'the report has been euppressed, I think we ought
to have a thoroughly frank etatement from
the honourable leader of the House li that
respect.
I feel that time je slipping on. Germany,
notwithstanding ber war budget, ia making
great efforts-you can read of them in the
press every day-to take care of conditions
aiter the war. Australia ig doing it; Japan
is doing it; the Uniteil States le doing lt;
Great Britain ie doing il; and I believe Canadýa is the only country that bas showii
no constructive effort from Government
sources te attempt to prepare for the con<litions that I have outlined.
I do not want te take up -the time of the
House unnecessarily. I have placed these
questions on the Order Paper simply from
a sense of! public duty, and I believe that
if we were given 'the privilege o! reading
the report of the Economic Commission, if
such a report bas ever 'been made, it would
elucidate a great deal and bl1aze a trail
which we. could follow, with advantage to
ourselves and to thle country.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honour*able gentlemen, I regret to Day that I have
*not the -saie confidence in reports as 'bas
*my honourable friend from Toronto. lIn
fact, I amn ra;ther surprised that a gentleman of his enterprise and energy should
place so much ronfidence in thean. If there
ris anything for which this Govýern.ment, and
other governinents, 'have been condemned,
it is the multiplicity of reports lin which
they have îndulged.

APRIL 30, 1918
Hon. Mr. BOYER: Orders in Council, flot
reports.
Hon. -Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 1 can further assure my honourable friend -that if
the preparation of reports by the Goveinment would -ive him any encouragement
along the lines .which he has pointed out
this afternoon, there s!iould not be very
'Imucdh difficulty in dealing with the subject.
We in 'Canada are to be congratulated on
having a nuinber of sudh enterprising captains of industry as my honourable friend
is, and I would say to them with ail due
deference that instead of relying tocs .much
upon the Governinent, if they exercise that
genius. which the Al.mighty- bas given them,
they will acco.mplisli a great deal more for
Canada than will any government. I have
always felt that we place too .much dependence on the paternalism of the Government in Canada. I do flot know why it ie;
yet it appears to me %that Canada, -more
than any other country of ivhieh I know,
has placed a reliance upon the Government
of the day, which, to a very large extent,
*has superseded. and destroyed that iriitiative
which should always ho exercised by the
individual citizens o~f a country. A gaverament, undoubtedly, t)hrough political and
other conditions 'which I need not point out,
is hanidicapped and en.cumbered in such a
way as to be unequal to meeting the great
exigencies which arise eut'of such a condition of affairs as we are to-day facing.
Therefoie, it seems 'to me that the great
captains of indu.stry ia. Canada, who have
invested millions, and upon 'whom we depend very largely for the development of
oui resources and the promotion of oui
commercial and financial enterprîses, should
*rely upon their own devices ta a greater extent Vhan they have done, and they should
ta, a corresponding extent dismiss the Goverament from responsibility for placing in
motion activities for the promotion of oui
trade, whether foreign or domestic. There
ia the greatest interest on the part of t~he
Government ta assist trade, not only at this
time, but during the reconstruction period
upon which -we shail shortly have to enter.
But, as 1 have said, governments lack that
ability ta grapple with a great situation
whisch individuals possess, and I hope .my
honourable ifriend -will no.t overlook this
very important fact vwhen. he is considering
this question.
I beg to give the fo'lla>winge answers ta the
questions whicli my honourable iriend bas
plaoed upon the Order Paper:

373

The answer to the firet question is yes.
The repart of thie Special.Connibtee of the
Senate on the Conservation of Canadàan
Trade le now before the Reconstruction
Com.mittee of the Caibinet for con-sideration.
In answei to question No. 2, the Econoie Commission lias prepared reports on
different subjets co'ming within the sco'pes
of its inquiry, but these, reports have not
been yet printed, and the information,
therefore, ia not et the present available.
It .will ibe for the Go-verniment to decide
upon the printing thereof.
Enytirely outside of the question asked,
it may be eaid that the Econamac Commission aoted largely in an advissory capacity.
on sevieral questions dealt with by the Governiment; but, owing toi the many extraordinswry conditions 'whiehi have arisen d'uring the war, neoeasitating the appointment
of special conimittees ta, deal thdrew-ith, it
wass thought it rwould- be .superfluous work
for the Ec-onomic Commnission ta make invesstigatione .along parallel lines 'with those
apecial committees, aud,'therefore, 'with a
view of not _conflicting 'with or u.veriapping
the work of a somewliat sienilar character,
the meznbers of th~e commission thought it
better that they should disband, and accordingly they have handed in their reaignations.
Hlon. HEWITT BOSTOCK: Honourable
gentlemen, ve -are much indebted ta the
honourable gentlemai from Toronto <Hon.
Mr. Nichoils) fo(r bringing this inatter liefore the House. The committee for which"
lie moved last sseseion was a sitep ini the
riglit ddre.ction.
It dealt 'with this question, ibringing it ta the attention of -theGovernment. We are, of course, ahl aiixioue that
such a condition of affaira s lie has outlined as lisible ta happen after the 'war is
over il sone steps are not taken, should not
corne to pass, and -that somisthing should
be doue to prevenit sucli a conition arising.
Lest ession 'we had two, commnittees dealing witli this question: one moved. for by
the honourable gentleman froan De Salaberry <Hon. Mr. Béique) to consider
espeeially the condition of farm.ing thiaugliout the country. That iommittee colleat-ed

should 'be urged to take more active steps
in this matter at the present moment. We
ail hope for the time when. this war will
corne te an end; but 1 fear the progreas
of ervents at the front cannot justify us in
expecting to see the termination of the war
at any rate d'uring this year.
Canada, as 'we -all know, is faced to-day
by very serions' preblems, and there la
a strong feeling, I think, on the part of
our people that the Go-verament is not
fa.cing the situation as th-ey should.ý They
have appointed several commissions. My
honourable friend the leader of the Goveru-ment says that the "Gove.rnxnent ha& been
critici&ed for the numýber of reports made;but I thin-k the criticisin that la being
mnade more than any other is that the
Giovernn4ient is not prepared to act on advice given'te thein. There has been given
to the Goverrnent a great deal of ad-vice,
which, if my iniformation is correct, they
have not seen fit to adopt; and the feeling
o! aome o! the gentlemen who vol-unteered
their services to assist on -some of these
commissions is thet their services have been
of very littIe value to the count.ry.
A short turne ago it was anuounced in
the papers that the Government were proposin'g te, deal with the question of motor
cars coming into this country, and I for,
one, expected toesee some action, taken.
I thouglit that it was a movement in the
proper direction, because'we in this country
aho>uld eut down a great deal of the expendîture and should limit the arnount of
nieney that is being sent out o! the country to purchase goods whieh. could be
bought in the co-untry. We should do ahl
that we cari to keep the mroney iu Canada.
This doctrine may not appeal to my honcurable fx4 end frein Rideau (Honý. Mîr.
Edwardýs), but I think he 'will agree with
me that as a war mea.sure it should be
adopted. 1 do not know that I would. have
ad'vocated this view some years ago; but
on accoun.t cf present conditions and the
war, some measure of that kind. ought
to be taken. There are somne ether luxunies, such as early vegetables and fruits,
which 1 think the country could very well
deo without. If I undjersta.nd aright, we are
to-day aending out cd Canada a large amount
of mnoney for the purpose cd buying these
with a little
goods, which meney,
o! 'the

undeoestand that recommendatione along

dealing wvith the matter. I take this oppertunity of imprcssing upen the leader of the
House that he should bring this iatter
-more strengly te 'the -attention of his colJeagues, iwith the view of inducing thenm
te tae immediate action upon it.
Hlon. Mr. NICHOLLS: I believe it ie my
privilege te say a f ew words in reply.
The honourable leader of the Government in answering ithe questions which I
asked, said that 1 was at libe.rty to read the
reports of a number o! commissions which
had already been -made. 1 beg te, draw his
attention to the f act that it we the report
of only one commission that I wanted te
read, because I considered that 'that report
'would, be cf the greatest possible value by
reason cf the fact that the chairman o! it
vas Sir James Lougheed. But apparently
that report which I. looked foi-ward te, has
been still-born. Whether it can be revived
by a pulmetor or by any ether method, I
de net know; but I am quite sure that if it
ever sees 'the light of day it will be of
gr eat interest and value to the public.
The leader of the Governmeut says that
the grç7at captains o! industry' should be
self-reliant and ehould net look for govea-nmexat assistance. I desire te say te hirn
aud te the House that I de net know any
class o! business men in any country who
are more self-reliant than the captains cf
iudustry in this country, and .when-ever an
opportunity is offered for them te show
their public spirit, their patrietiani, their
ingenuity. or their manufacturing ability,
they always seize upen the occasion. I
need only instance what has been dene by
thein in regard te ships, munitions, shipbuilding, the dyestuff industry, and everything- else that appeared te, be in the interest of Canada and would help lu the conduct o! the 'war. [t sis ail very 'welil to talk
about îndividual effort; ibut, as I pointed
eut last year-and 1 arn not geing te repes.t
anything that 1 said then-every public
moivement m.ust have a leader. lu this
case it i6 the Governinent 'that must lead,
aud the others wilh cooperate. It is abselutely necessary, if we are going te fight
abroad for expert trade which will take, the
place of the expert war-trade that 'we have
to-day, that we should have the prestige,
direct or indirect, o! goverument- assistane or approval. Other governments, inicluding the Britishi Goveru-meut, which
at ail times,
has been our inedel
are net hesitating te give that, and
te. follow

why should

that the whele trouble is that the depart-

APRIL 30, 1918
ment of .the Government that is charged,
or should be charged, 'with the prosecution
of such matters as these, have too much on
their hands, or, for sorne reason or other,
are net showing the initiative which the
country has the right to expect.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: Honourable gentlemen, I did not-know this discussion vas
going to, ho held so quiokly. 'I vanted to
say a word or two, -having been absent for
two or three day", and being anxious to
say something to some one.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: You have flot
the right çwithout the leave of the House.
lion. Mr. CROSBY: I ask the leave of
the House. 1 have no desire to interfere
with the rulea of the House, and if 1 were
to say anything respecting them, I would
say this was a very bad mile and should
Le changed as soon as possible.
What I want te say is that my honourable friend from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Nichoilse. bas brought befome the House a very
important question, dealing with the
arrangement of a trade policy for Canada;
but, if -I understand aright, we are to-day
a var Government sud, a war Parliament,

Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE: And blood in our

true; but any man who observes the
struggle-that is geing on to-day in Europe
must corne to the conclusion that the Government of Gerxnany had, given its attention
m-hoiiy and solely to this war for very many
years. It was not the people. I do not
mean to say that our Government shouid
be occupied in a similar way; but I refer
to that in order to show that govemnments
mnust lead, and in ail] countries they will
lead and continue to lead. That is their
purpose. 6o it is always a geod excuse to
say that the people should undertske te
do a certain thing. They do net need to
have any representatives in Parliamènt

the war. When the war ie successfully
finished-.and Canada ha-s already played a~
great part in it-then. we cas consider the
policies advocated by my honourable friend
and other honourable gentlemen in the interest of the country.
Hon, W. C. EDWARDS: Honourable gentlemen, I thisk the idea that we should
simply maintaiu the status quo and that
nothing should be cossidered or dose until
this war is over, is a mistake, and 1 agree
with my honourable friesd from Toronto
(Hon. [Mr. Nicholis) that sericus consideratien should be gives te what Canada's
position may be alfter the war is over, and
te wh.at Canada shall do te meet the very
serious obligations, with which we shall be
confronted in. consequence of 'this war. But
I agree withi one remark made iby rny honourable friend who has just sat down (Hon.
Mr. Crosby), samnely. that alter the war
thé world will be a new world. No one
living to-day can tell just what the ramification-s cf trade and commerce will be
atter the close cf the war; no one knows
what the purch-asing poweris cf the variodas
coustries now engaged in this war will be.
But there la no doubt that the world will
require certain commrodities, and I thînk
that we in -Canada would do 'welI to .make
a study cf what Canada's resources are,
how we cau compete with other portions cf
the world in the production of those resources, and whbat we had betiter do te promote the development cf oui natural resources for that purpose.
Now, agriculture is our first and primary
resource. On agriculture Canada depends
more than on ail her i ndustries together,
and any'thing that can be done ta enable
the agriculturists, alter thia war is over ta
produce more ecouemically and efficiently
than la dose at present, will be a great
benefit to Canada. .At the moment labour
is very scarce, but it is astosishing what
a tracter wîll do in cur western prairies to
replace labour.
There wa. -one resnark madie by my honouraible friend who, leads the- Governiment
(Hon. Sir James Lougheed>) with whîch. 1
most thoroughly agwee, that if the Government of this ceuntry-in lact, the geverumeunt cf every country-would just leave
the varieus industries to theniselves and
not hamper them. in any way, they will give
their fbest results.

be done -in our i.ndustry aliter the war is
over, but really we are lat sea. There is
not one al us who knowar what is going to
happen. If the portions of Europe 'which
have been devastated will use lumber to
any appreciable extent in reconstruction,
an inquiry on the part of the lumibermen
as to what kinds an~d descriptions of lumber will 'be required, in thiose viarious (parts
of Europe and what the lumnibermen ean do
to meet thora reqruireinents, .would be a
highly desiraible one to undertake.
-Coming ta our minerai resources, which
are nex~t in importance, I will at once admit that Canada does not stand in the
f oremost position in the production of steel.
Other countries have advantages o-ver Canada; fiut, after ail, eoïne industries are s0
placed that they can perhaps compete. The
question cf .the developinent. of our minerai
resources. abould also ble investigated.
As to our fisheries, I need not say anything, because in the production cf food
that indu8try will perhaps take care of itself. But nxy humble opinion i-s that an
inquiry should ibe muade regarding our naturai xesources, -and -I think it had better be
made by the business men. theiselves.
Hon bbr. DOMVILLE: And the banks.
Hon. - Mr. EDWARDS: And perhaps the
hantes, in order to determine 'what our resources are, hmw they can be ;best and mù6t
econolmically produeed, and in -what products we can compete -in'the .markets of the
world w'ith siiiia pi'oducts firom other countr-ies.- Inquiry ïmight also be mxade. as th
what the requirements are in various cauntries, in erder that ve may prepare to meet
them.
Hon. 'Mr. ]XOMVILLE. Honorab1e gentliemen, I aggree thoroughly in whait has been
raid as to non-paternal governnient. I think
we have hiad too m-ueh pazter.nal, goviernment
in Canada for the good of thie country. On
that -point I concur entirely in what has
been raid by my honourable friend the
leader of the 4Covernment; but I wil1 admit
that it is 'the first time I have heard a
minister of the Crown inake that statement.
I agree with the honourable member from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Nichelis), and I concur
in the academical declarations 'we have had
from others in this House, but they are not
to the point. The greatest question is that
of farming. If you do not feed the people
Vhey cannot live; if you do sot, raise sufficient crops they can.not survive. It is the
creps which provide us 'wit'h the food we

cf agricultural production cernes in. How
are we gcdng te increase the production cf
crops without the use cf fertilizers? I suppose seme cf you -honourahile gentlemen

Potash is very scarce at the moment. Nitregen aids in the growing cf wheat and grain
cf every kind. Here we have been discuss-,
ing the question of the future deveiepýCanada; we are aIl se muchi conment cYf

nobedy said a word about Nova Scotia in
t'his respect? Honeurabie gentlemen have
made kindly reference te Nova iScotia's
resources in flsb. Weil, Nova Scotia's resources are net ail fish; some are flsh and
some are flesh. Until yen develop in Canada your reffourcer, of nitrogen, your crops
cannet be kept up f0 the requirements. The
Maritime Provinces are the only part cf
Canada we know cf at the moment from
which a supply cf nitrogen may be obtained.

I do net want te take up the time cf t.he

te heip the districts -which are able te produce it. instead of aliowinga our resources

I brought up a certain matter the other
day. Something will be said about it presen'tly. My purpose in bring-ing up the questien was te eniighten this House and- the
country as to one cf its golden resources.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: In wbat form is
that nitregen in New Bruns-wick?

Hon. Mr. DOMVILIE: The nitrog-en is
in ammoniacal water. This is treated with
-sulphuric acid, by lime 'precipitateci, which
resuits in suiphate of ammonia cryrstailized,
a certain percentage of which goes into the
fertilizer, according to the strengthi of amnmonia you want to give te it. This question la a very serions and important one,
and I hope it will have the attention of
the Government. 1 do flot vant to be unfair te the Government. We have no't yet

Now, I wcuid ask my henourable friend

wiil send yen our experts. We have plenty of
women there tee, and tbey will give yeu a
great many vo'tes as they did in the last
election, when ten, eleven or twelve members of the same family voted for the Union
Government. They will do like that again,
especiaily when the honcurable, gentleman
frem Victoria (Hon. Mr. Cioran) puts
througah his resolution. Our women are
ready te help in food production, and our
fisherie.s resources are cf great adyvantage.
Hon. G. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Honourable gentlemen, the henourable leader cf
the Government (Hon. Sir James Lou,,heed) was very frank in st.ating that the
Minister of Trade and Commere and the
Government would net, even if ex-pected te
do so, take very much part. A principe
which has been adopted in the legisiatio'n
cf Great Britain and hier colonies is te let
miatters take their natural course. The
principle is that the state shou]d do nothing for the subject; that the subject should
take care cf himse]f and, ]et-the devil take
the hindmost. That had alwvays been the
policy cf the Empire But -%Nhen this war

such as could never bave been produced
by private initiative. I quite agree that
the present Government of Canada bas
been elected only for the purpose of seeing
this war through, but incidental to this
war there are many questions that are only
of secondary importance. One of these is
the problem of seeing that those of us who
survive the war shall not perish from the
land when the war is over. To that end
statesmanlike efforts must be made to reconstruct the trade of this nation, which
tas fallen into the most chaotic state, or
wil1 do so, as soon -as the arms of the fighting nations are laid down. A man who has
a aore will get well some day perhaps, if
he has the 'strength to throw off the poison;
but a skilled physician can restore bis
health in very much less time than nature
left to herself. So it is with the Government. The · overnment can he]p in mainG
taining the trade cf Canada and in promoting its growth, and in my humble judgment one of the duties which the Union
Government bas thrown upon it by the
election of the people of this country is to
take care lest our nade fail after the war.
The Government is doing this very thing
now. It bas announced a policy of taking
a new census of Canada. For what purpose is that census to be taken? I am told
by a member of the Government that it ås
to ibe taken for the purpose of supplying
labour 'to the industries of this country.
The manufacturers are invited to knock at
the door Of Parliament, of the Government,
and ask: " Where can we find the necessary
and diversified labour that we require?"
The Government, in order that they mxay be
able to answer this question, propoises to
spend halH a million dollars-in my humble
judgmernt, most unwisely-4n taking a new
census, which I believe will be about as
much good as the last one that was taken.
But it is to be done; a great effort is to be
made and millions of men are to be registered and catalogued. Surely if the Government bas time to do that for the benefit
of trade, it ought' to have time to do other
things for the same purpose. I submit,
therefore, that this report should receive
careful and serious consideration at the
hands of the Government.
Hon. C. P BEAUBIEN: I understood
clearly what the honourable gentlemen from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Nicholls) was driving
at. I did not quite clearly understand the
objections that were thrown in hs path.
From one honourable gentleman I hear that
this is a question of policy, and thereHon. G. LYNCH-STAUNTON.

fore that it may be introducing into the
united effort of this nation, which is so
much required, a disturbing element. I do
not think very much argument is required
to dispel that danger--or fear rather than
danger. This lis not a question of policy
in the sense in which we have hitherto been
accustomed to regard political issues as
that of free trade, for instance.
Another objection- is that the effort required is not that of the nation, but that
of the individual. We have now overseas 400,000 men.
They have done for
the protection of our country and the world
more than any other men that have stayed
here. When they return, it is the duty of individuals, or the duty of the nation, to see
that they get employment? How will they
get employiment unless the wheels of industry are kept going? And Ls it not the
paramount duty of the nation, that is to
say, of the Government, to see that industries are kept alive and active ater the
war? Tis is a duty that bas been recognized by all the nations that are at war.
May I tell you what has been done, to
my knowledge, in France? The whole male
population of th'at country is in the
trenhes; but what are they doing behind
the trenches? They are preparing industries
for the time when their men come home;
they are preparing for the aftermath of
war, so that the French nation will be able
to carry the increased -load of debts and
obligations incurred during the war. Are
we so rich, or is our country so developed,
that we can dispense with such preparations as are being made to-day by France
-yes, and by that greatest and richest
country in the world, England? Can we dispense wiýth such preparations? What will
happen, then, after the war? Do you wapt
to have your men go back to their own
industries and find them closed, 'and on
meeting the proprietors of those industries
have them say: " We have given all our
energies to the manufacture of munitionsthat is, what was required at the time; now
that the war is finished our industries are
closed; we are sorry, but you will have to
look elsewhere for work." Are they doing
that in France?
Allow me to tell you of Citroën, whose
work has been cited the world over, because, without having anything to his name
-nothing but his genius, nothing but the
tewening power of energy-he one day left
the ranks of the army as a mere lieutenant. He asked for three days' furlough.
He went to the Minister of War and told

APRIL 30, 1918
him tbat within three months hie would
build up in the centre of Paris -a manufactory that would produce 50,000 shells a
day. He had the genius; hie was believed;
hie had loit a cent; but hie went ýto a bank,
and with bis contract hie raisedl over 2,000,000 franes. He set to -w4rk, and like mag ie
this mar-vellous rnonster industry rose in
the centre of Paris; -and on schedule Uime,
alter three months, hie gave to the army
50,000 shelîs a day. This i6 perh-aps the
largest manufacitory of shelis the world
over, buit in three months. Do you think
that the Government of France bas alic>wed
Citroën and bis geudus to stop on-the way?
No, he is nowv making, 50,000 ýshelîs a day.
Not only that, -but hie is nursing in its infa.ncy one of the greatc-st industries thut
France bas ever known. 'WThcn the farmcrs whose sons bave been slaughtered in
the war turn Vo the Goverrument .for help,
through the genius of Citroën, wbo is now
flot working for bimself, but for the nation
and for tbe French -soldiers, tjhey will get
cheap tractors, and iso replace in their fields
the mnen -who bave given their blood to tbe
soul of France.
Weli, bonourable gentlemen, why sbould
we noV do the saine? Alter ail, did not the
member for Toronto urge the Giovemnment
to do that? And is it noV tbe paramounit
diity of the Governiment Vo do it? We mnust
look our duty in the face and flot fiinch. The
load ils a heavy one, and ministers may
vcry well be forgiven if they do flot accomplish everything 8uggested by people who
bave time Vo reficet and rnake, suggestions
and complaints; but the preparation of
industry alter the war-is one of the essential duties which the Government must
not be allowcd to forget.
In France there are to-day 3,500 municipalities com.plctely razed Vo tbe ground, and
there will be, as many in Belginu, and a
great many in Italy. Why could noV the
Governrnent select the best brains that can
be found, flot only in this country, but if
nece.ssary in the United ýStates, France or
anywhere in the world, and ask, those men
to devote ail their time, ingcnuity and
genius Vo ascertaining- how Canada after
the war eau utilize the plants now busy
manufacturing shells, and also the immuense wlvantage we have in naturalproduets in rebuildinga these devastated areas?
Ho-w is it that we cannot standardize
our metho.ds of construction when we
are faced -%vitb the neceïssity of rebuilding areas three times as populous as Canada? If our Canadian industries were
given a chance of rebuilding- this %~vhole

379

country, rebuildiug it entirely, re-cquipping
it entirely, refurnishiug it entirely would
our industries bave to complain? ýHo-w is iA
that we carinot contemplate Vhe tremneudous
amount of work that will ibe rcquired to be
donc in France, Belgium and IValy alter
the war, in building tbousands -and bundrcds of thousands of houses, or in the iron
industry, or in using our asbestos P In
Frauce to-day enormous amounts of ashesVos are being, used in temporary buildings.
There is flot a .pound of rail that will be
worth while in France; tbere is flot a
wheel in macbinery that docs noV -eryaloud
Vo be renewcd. Why cannot we, with the
best Valent we can find in our country or
elsewbcre, ascertain what product we can
now prepare, standardize, produce cheaply
-more cheaply perhaps than anywhere
cisc in the world-and then go Vo those
industries that are now working exclusively
for the 'war and say Vo them: "This is what
-you
eau do after the war; so you must now
prepare Vo transform your macbincry, so
that wbcn Vhe time cornes this article
rcquired in Europe can libe manufactured;

thc shella; wc will finance foxj you, if
required, as we bave donc for w-ar purposes;
and we will sdil that pioduct for you in
Europe, -as we, have donc the things you
bave produced in connection witb the war."
Our rade bas been or will bc crippled by
the war. Why sbould noV the Governmrenýt
sce to it that it ia curcd of that iII, given
new sources of strengtb, new meithods, and
a new lcase of life, so Vo speak, after tlie
war? We will bave Vo bear alter the war a
load of heavy taxation. You can take from
the ground the gold that is in .it, or its
products; but unless you can seli the latter
outside the country tbey will noV help you
toïhear your burden; and unless you organize now for the di6posai of such products
you wili be too laVe. The United States
bave flot waited Vill this laVe hour Vo do
that; they bave been doiiug iV for more than
one year and a hall. Are tbey poorer than
we are? Are Vbey more dependent than we
are on new industries, new sources of profit,
alter the war? Has their Government less
to do than ours?
These -are matters wvhich, iV sens. Vo nme,

Hon. P. A. CGHOQUETTE: The honourable gentleman from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Nichoîls) drew the attention of the Government to the necessity of preparing for conditions after the war. It is a very great question, and I think it will ho well for the
Government to answer it in another way,
because I arn sorrv to see that the leader
of this House tried te throw cold water on
the proposition of our honourable friend,
saying it is flot for the Governiient to do
things of this kind, but for the captains
of industry to look after them. The honourable memiber for Halifax (Hon. Mr.
Crosby) a]so said that this Government was
elected especially to carry on the war and
finish it, -andi that if we disturbed the mind
of the Goverument by discussing trade conditions, the war would not go on so well
as it should. I do not think that that is
a fair position. This Governrnent bas been
selected to carry on the war, and will, I
hope, do it successfuliy. Everyhody expects
that, ýbut the Government bas also to look
after the husiness of this country.
.Now, I have a sugg,-estion. When the
'Government went to the countc-y

it con-

tained about 20 ministers, a larger number
than ever before, because it was said that
a greater number were required for the business of the country and thie war. Since the
election the Governnient have added other

ministers, s0 that now they number about
25. My suggestion is thiat one of those
ministers :should give his whole time, and
have ail the authority necessary, to propare for conditions after 'the w-ar. Such a
minister could take the place of the special
committee of the Sonate on tiue Conservation of Canadian Tracie, and ai-o the work
of the 'Economic Commission m-hich wvas
appointed hy the Goveromnent. Thie question
that the niemnber for Toronto asked wvas
whether the i:eports of those two bodies
had been made, and, if net, why not.
1 arn of the opinion that the reports of the
committees of this House or of the other
House do not amount to much. Committees meet during the session te take
evidence, and no one se-es thetir reports. I
Hon.

think that if a member of -the Government
w-ere specia.lly charged to deal withi aftier-war
conditions, that wouid be t.he solution of
the problem; because, after ail, production
ýis not the only thing. We mnust find a
market for the sale of our produets in order
that the business of 'this country miay go
on.
1 will go further. The leader of the
Government has said Vlhait trhe hionourable
gentleman f rom Toronto is one of the
captains of industry. That is quite true,
and I wouid suggest that the honourable
genjtleman from Toronto be offered a seat
and
be charged
in the Government
wi*th the administration, of this important question.
I arn sure that rtlhe
honourabde
gentleman
would
aocep't,
perhaps even without Éexnuneration, and
1 arn convinceil that he -would ho a
proper man to carry on that work, and 1
would have more confidence in Immi as a
niember of tiie Governmient than 1 wvould
Qi ýsny those conuniîttees.
He shouId be
given the, authioricty possesse.dby the specia]
Comrnittee of the Senate on 'the Conservation of Canadian Trade and the Econoinic
Commission. He ahould have authority to
cadi for witnesses andi send for reports and
papers, and I arn sure ithat with such a
minister ïn charge of such a department a
great deal of good would ho accomplisbed.
Though I believe we have enough cabinet
mmnistors now, I would be prepared te
endorse one more, if 'it would pay to have
him, to take charge of this special department of trade conditions after the w-ar, and
I hope that this suggestion ýmay have effeet.
I was sorry to hear the leader of the
Government excuse himseif in the way he
did by tbroWing cold water.on the proposais of the ýhonourable gentlemnau from
Toronto, and I was especialiy sorry to see
one of fiis colleagues corne to his rescue by

Ho n. E. L. GIRROIR: Honourable gentlemen, notwitlistanding the divergence cf
opinion that w*as expressed here Le-day upon
the proposition. 1 tbink that eventualiy
we shahl ail corne te the conclusion that
it is one of the fundamental, one of the
principal duties of Governments to assist
in the deveiopment of the resources of the
country. The countries w4hich have iorged
to the fronit in recent years have done se
bec-anse of the fact that their Governments
have given much time and- money te
scientifie research and investigation. They
have studied the resources of the country
which they governed; they have appointed
eminent men of science and have given
them authority and assistance te make a
thoreugh. investigation inte ail the reseurces
of the country te which they belonged.
They have done -more: they have endeavoured by financiai essistance and other
means te establish in those ceuntries industries arising eut of this research and
investigation, and they have fostered these
industries and have helped them whihe
they were young and tottering, until they
reached the estate of manhood, and thus
have given employment te their people,
have widened their commerce, and have
placed theinselves in such a position that,
when engaged in any great struggie of war
or commerce, they wouid have avaihable all
their resources, se that tbey could be placed
at the disposai of the generals in war as
weiI as the generais in the coe-nmerciai
life of the nation, and -of the world at large.
Germany, whoni we despise becauee of the
principles of morality and law fer which
slie stands, bas made tremendous advances
in science and development, because of the
fact that shie bas net stayed bier hand,
but bas gene on and on assisting in
the development of the resources cf
that country by every means in bier
power.
That she is so powerfuh in
arms in the warfare which is tak-ing
place to-d;ay is largely due to this fact.
Cut off lier supplies in one respect, and
she immediateiy turns te ithe men wbom she
has educated in lber universities, to whiom
sbe bas givcrn practical experience in the
"crrk of cientific investigation, and she i

that we bave taken away from he". Ail

Germany's arm lias been strctng because of
this fact. To-day we, are eng-aged in a
struggl-e the like of wliich the world lias

lu is a struggle iûr
domination in this wortc.. To-morrow, v-lten
ii war ends, we shafl be engaged in the
greatest commercial struggle that th4s
wnrld has ever seen. Then it will be necessary for every country engag-ed in that
strugglP to be in a position to place her
resources, and to aid her people in placingher resources, *where they will be most
effective in that commercial figaht.
The development of a coun.try depends
upon two things, in my humble opinion:
it depends upon the enlightenment with
which the chosen représentatives of the
people, the Government of that country.
has used its powers to assist in the develop'ment of the country; and it depends upon
the response which the people of that country give to the encouragement of the Governiment. To tell us, that the development
of a country must be left e'ntirely to the
people is, to my mi, wrong in principle
a.nd wrong in practioe. We have established
in this country, and ail governments do
establish, schools. They begin the educatien of their people in the primary schools.
Thon they establish scientific schools and
schools of research and investigation. There
are in Ottawa branches of different départmonts, which are devoting their onorgies
to an investigation of the resourcos of this
country. Wo have -the Geological Survey,
w'hich is, I believo, undor the Departmont
of Mines, and which is doing a groat, work
-sending experts througahout the country
to ascor-tain the nature of the different deposits and resources which this country
contains. *The Mine Branch is engaged in
a similar work. It is not my opinion that
theso and other dopartmemts of the Govorniment have donc too much along theso
lines; my opinion is that they have done
too little.
Therefore, Sirs, I make no apology for
bringing this matter to the attention of
the House. The honourable mombor for
Rothesay (Hon. Mr. Domvilie), who spoke
the other day, lias devoted a great part of
his life to the study of this important question, and hie is in a better position to deal
with it intelligently than 1 couid hope to
be. In my own province there are large
deposits of ni] shales. From my reading
of the subject I flnd that tlue timý bias comtý

that I m.ight bo able to give, an intelligent
version of what is proposed in this regard.
Mr. Guy Elliott Mitchell,' of the United
States Geological Survey, ini an article in
the National Géographie Magazine fur

1 appliod to the Mines Dep.artment for
information upon this subject, and I have
here, a lette rom. Mr. John MoL.eish, Chief
,)f the Division of Minerai Re6ourcos. and Statistics, in 'which. he furniehes me with. the
following information. He, has given the statics ehowing the aunual production of crude
petroleuin in COanada, coviering the years
froxu 1881 to 1917. What do 'e, find? We
find, that the anuual production o.f crude
petroleum in -Canada bas fteen steadily docreasîng. In 1899 we 'were producing annýually 808,570 1barxrele. In 1917 'the production lhad diropped to 205,=3 barrels; yet, as
yeu know, the demnand for this product is
inoreaasin-g day iby day.
Lot us loo.k at the -statistic-6 from the
United States of Amorica. What do 'we find
there? We 4lnd the very sarne thing happemning, but in a ddifforent way The old oul
fields of the United States are petering out.
Rt is true tilat the volume of production is;
keeping up, but only 'by the exploitation of
new oul fields. 'The state of California in
1914 produced 99,775,327 tharrels, and in 1915
its production had fallen te 86,591,535. Pennsylvania and New York in 1891 produced
33,009,236 1barrelis, -and in 1915 thoir production had fallen to. 8,726,483 barrelqs.
Ohio
in 1896 produced 23,941,169 barrols, and in
1915 its production had falleni to 7,825,326
barrels.
I have the figures for the other
6tatoes, and they ail tell the, samne tale. In
Texas ini 1905 the production amountod to
28,136,189 Ibarrels, and, in 1910 it 'vas only
8,899,266 barrels.
New fields are being
opened in Miseouri, Oklahoma, Wyo.ming
arnd Louiýsiana, and the people in those

states, are considering how they can ke-ep
up 'with the eormous demanda for crude
oul and offset the decrease in production which i6 taking place in the wells

Thus it will be en that in 1916 the total
quantity of oiîs we imported was 292,426,121
gallons; and in 1917, the very nexit year, the
imiportation had risen to 378,224,746 gallons.
Now, honourable gentlemen, that is the
demand in Canada, and it follows that we
should endeavour to find out whether we
have cil shales in this country, and, if so,
in what quantity, and where they are to
be found. 1 have here a statement from
Mr. Louis Sirnpson, an industrial engineer
who lives in Ottawa, who bas made a
special study of the oil shales industry.
He has looked into the oil shales, in Nova
Scotia, New Brunswick and other parts of
Canada, and lie has been in Scotland investigating the industry there. He has a
very wide knowledge of this aubject-and
I may say that in my preparation. of this
matter I have received rnost valuable assistance frorn hirn. He telle me that there
is at Albert MitNew Brunswick, et
least 400,000,000 tons of shale; there is at
the Baltinmore,' Turtle Creek, in Albert
county, and sundry deposits in Westmorla.nd county, about 200,000,000 tons. In
Pictou outnty, Nova Scotia, there is about
200,000,000 tons; at Lake Ainslie there is
about 200,000,000 tons; and in Antigonish,
in Nova Scotia, there is probably 100,000,000

tons. In Saskatchewan, as I understand
froma a western meinher, there is a very
large deposit of shale. It occurred to me
when we were discussing the shale question

the other day that that shale deposit, if it
were developed as I beli 'eve all the shale
deposits in this coun.try will be developed,

would be of the very greatest advantage in
producing motive power for the Hudýson Bay
railway, if that railway is ever completeci.

The Elîs report, frorn which I have read,
f urnishes valuable information with regard

to the shele deposits of the Dominion; but
any one reading that report will corne to
the conclusion that there is much more to
ha ascertained, much more to be investigated, and manch more information that
should ha obtained with regard to the shale
3i1 depositsz of this country. The province
of Québec lia6 also oil shale6. 1 think I arn
.safe in stating that we have in thi8 country
probably fifteen hundred million tons of oil
shale, which is sufficient to su.pply works
retorting probably twelve or thirteen
thousand tons per day for the next two
hundred and twenty years.
That we have-large deposits is one thing,
but it is important to know the value and
the cost of production of these products.
With regard to the latter item, I may say

REVISED EDITION

SENATE

386

that the oost of production in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, at least, will be very
much less than the cost in Scotland,
because in Scotland they have to obtain
their shale by deep mining, whereas in New
Brunswick and N<cva Scotia mucli of the shale,
is near the surface, and eaa. be taken up with
steam shovels, thus saving the cost of sinking pits, and of %the machinery that is
While
necessary to mine underground.
wages in this country are greater than they
are in Scotland, the advantage that we
derive from the fact that 6o much of the shale
is expoeed, and can be obtained so readily,
will, 1 believe, overcome altogether and overbalance the advantage of lower wages. The
Scottish industry dates from 1848; and, if
you look down through the years through
which that industry has progressed towards
the position which it holds to-day, you will
find that it was engaged ini a tremendaus
îtruggle owing to the f act that, alfter it got
well onto ils feet, great cil wells were
struck in the United States and in other
countries; but, notwithstanding that, the
industry has been making good, and is
to-day producing 18 per cent on the
investinent, a.nd thoursands upon 'thousandea
of barrelis of cil every year.
Acmrding ta a table at page 27 of Mr. Ells'
report, I find that in Scctland durîng the
year 1873 they produced 524,095 tons of
ehale, whereas in 1896 they produced
2,435,555 tons. The increase appears ta be
graduai, which shows 'that the industry is
a strong and healthy one. There has been
no great boom in any one year in the
production of oul shales or in the retorting
processes. The growth has been steady and
healthy. which shows that the industry
has firmly established itself during its process of d-evelopment.
I wish now, just 'briefly, ta institute a
comparison between the Canadian oil
shales and the Scottish ail shales. 1 have
ta rely eomeirhat on my friend Mr. 6impson
for information on this subjeet, and also
upon the different reports that have been
publiished from time to time. In a letter
whieh 1 have from Mr. Simpson, he -states
that the Scot-ch -shale deposits, ae> worked
in the year 1913 according ta the report
of a United States engineer who was sent
over ta Scotland specially ta investigate
and report upon the Scotch oul shale inBy the
dustry, gave the following- resuits.
Dalmeny Comnpany the average yield per
ton shale of imp-erial gallon was 22. These
are the different specirnens of the shale
which were retorted and analyzed. By the

gallons. The average of ail the Scottish
shales dncluded in this report was 22J gallons per ton.
'Now, when we corne ta the New Brunswick shales, what do we find? We find the
average very much higher. No. 1 sample
gave 41 gallons of ail per ton; No. 2 gave
42 gallons per ton; No. 3 gave 52 gallons
per tan; No. 4 gave 43 gallons per tan.
No. 5 gave 32 gallons per ton; No. 6 gave 34
gallons; and No. 7 gave 42 gallons per ton.
The analysis of the New Brunswick shales
was made by the Mines Brandi of the Department of Mines at Ottawa, and has been
checked time and again by the chemista of
the Imperial Institute, London, England,
and by industrial chemists in New York,
London and Glasgow. Sa, you will ses that
the ail shales of New Brunswick are very
mucli richer in oil than are the shales of
Scotland.
1 have here also a report of Ronald Johnstoine & Son, who, I believe, are Scottiali engineers. This is a report on the
New Brunswick shales, and is dated May
28, 1914. They state that a sample marked
A yielded 39 gallons per ton of crude cil;
s ample B, 40 gallonis per bon; sample C,
50 gallons per ton; sample D, 32 gallons
per tan. Sa we find that the shales. of aur
awn country are richer in ail than are the
shalea of Scotland.
Nayw, if it is true that with a small demand for cil, as compared. with the demand
of the present day, great industries have
been built up in Scotland, s'urely we in
Canada will be able ta take hold cf this
industry and bring out of it a develapment
that will stand good for this country and
for aur people in the days th-at are to corne.
I wish ta quote from the report of Mr.
Ells with regard ta the Nova Scotia sha.e
ail. At page 35 lie says:
The following extracts, taken from Professer
Henry Hawo%'s Mineralogy of Nova Scotia, 1868,
may be also quoted: "Concerning the oil-coal of
Antigonish county, Mr. J. Campbell reports a
five foot seani of curly cannel, wh!ch wiIl yleld
at least 40 gallons of crude cil per ton, and
fifteen teet of cil shale, which. will yield, at least
20 gallons per ton."
In the same volume, he refers also te the
shale deposits found In liants county, thus:
"The non-productive coal-measures of liants
county afford large quantities of shale, which
have led to expectations of flnding coal.-

At page 39 some lurther information is
given with regard ta the ail shales of Nova
Scotia and Xew Brunswvick, which shows
that they are inestimably better oshales
than those of Scotland. The repart says:
.At M.cLellan Brook, Pictou, the Frazer cilcoal gives 40 gallons crude per ton; at Coal
brook, the Frazer ail-coal and oil-batt together

APRIL 3o, 1918
give 53 gallons per ton; ai McCulloch brook,
tlhe Frazer 011-000,1 gives 77 gallons per ton; tihe
Albert coal or Albertite gives 100 gallons Ver
ton; the Torbane ill coal gives 125 gallons
Ver ton.
It will thus be seen that in Pictou county,
where these shales outcrop at several points
and are in large extent, the possibilities of
suowedaul development are such as ta warrant exploitation.
I feel certain that I have made my point
that the Scottish shales are not as rich in
oil as are those of Canada. If, as I have
said, the industry could ha madle a success
in Scotland, it can bie made a success bers.
The opportunities for success to-day ini an
industry of that kind are tenfoid what they
-were
when the Scottish industry was established. We in Canada are engaged in a war,
it is true, but we are engamred in a war from
whîch we expect to corne forth victorious,
and after the war we have ta develop this
country to provide for a great population
which will have to live in this Canada of
ours, and it is up to us to
country in such a way that we develop this
may provide
not only employment for ail our people,
but the motive power at low cost through
which. and by whieh great industrial development may be possible. Honourable
gentlemen know as well as I do that during
the great war Germany has flot been idle ini
this respect. She has made it a point to
secure for herseif the rich oil wells of
Ruinania. The United States are investigating this most valuable produet, and, as
was pointed out the other day by my
honourable friend who introduced this question (Hon. Mr. Domville), only this spring
an agent of the United States Government
appeared in New-Brunswick with a proposition to take hold of the oil shales there. Al
countries are reachinz out in this regard.
England, realizing the value of oil, has by
Act of Parliament subscrilbed for the whole
bond issue of the Anglo-Persian Oil coinpany, of London, *England, and has also
purchased one-half the common etock at a
cost of $ 15,000,000. All over the world
people realîze that oil is going ta be one of
the great mrotive powers in the future. One
has rnerely to open his eyes to realize that
fact.
We in Canada, a year or two ago, were
mu-eh dietressed because the nickel industry hiac not beau developed in thi8 country because the product of our nickel mines
was being taken ta another country and
was being manufactured there, -and we were
iosing no.t on-ly the value that would accrue
ta aur people from the establishment of
that industiry in aur midct, but al-so the

control oif that very valuable product.
Thera was a great cry raised throughout
this country that the Germans were getting
hold of our nickel. If 'we -aregoing te allow
this country to act in, the saie manner
with respect ta this impo.rtant product, we
shaîl, I think, be making a very great mistake. Aîter the war our boys will be returuing ta us, and we desire to pro'vide industries ini this country in which they eau
find employ'ment. They are not aIl going
back ta the farm; they are not aIl fro~m the
farm. 0f those wh<> are £rom the farin, I
suppose, many will go back; but there will
be a large number of men coming home,
and, un-lesa this coun.try is prepared for
developinent, unless we are able to provide
industries that will initerest them. and
afford them, employment, what is goin-g
ta be the resultP Let me give .you a le'w
more figures. Beft>re the war the maximum quantity of shales mined in, Scotland was 2,500l,000 ton-s. &o that Canada is
now importing each year in crude oils and
the producte of crude ola, the produets of
shales, a quantity double that rnined in
Scotlaud each year prior ta. the war. The
late Dr. Elle of -the Geographical Survey
estimates the cost of mining and retorting,
chiefiy wages, at $1.40 per ton. T<-day the
cost would, be higher; but at $1.40 the an,
nual wages cost for 5,000,000 tons would, be
no lese than $ 7,000,000. The surn of s 7,000,000, at an average weekiy wage of $25,
would pay 6,730 men, mnaking, with sun.;
dries, about 7,000 men.
No other indus:try exists, pe'rlaps, that is
go suitable for the emloyment of returned
sold-iers, as ail the work Is clone by machinery that operates slo'wly, and, the work required -eau be easily and quickly learned.
To settie thé returned 8oldler upon the
land wiil cost the Government $i,600 ta
$2.000 cash per man, Therefore, to settie
7,000 men at $2,000 par man wo'uld cost the
Government in cash, $14,000,000. 0f thie
sum a portion at least will neyer be repaid
ta the Goverument, and the collec'ting of
the interest and the overlooking af the settiers will require thé expenditure annually
of large eumns of moneyr in salaries and,
expen ses.
I need not point out that, were fuel oil
always obtainable, so that thé vesseis
coming into and leaving Canadian ports
could be sure of finding supplies when
required, the cil shale industry of Canada
ought to provide employment for 10,000
men, which means a population of 50,000
persans.
The Maritime Provinces, and the whoie
of Canada, look ta the Government to give

388

the lead in this matter, and I have every
confidence and fully believe that they will
net fail in doing this.
Just a word as te the commercial value
ci cil ýshales. Says Dr. Ellis in his report,
at page 34:
The commercial value of the ojl-shale can be
best inferred f rom a study of the prices and
quantities obtained by distillation. Thus in the
case of the shipment nmade from New Brunswick as per results already stated, the yield
of crude oil was found to be 40 gallons imperlal,
or 48 United States gallons, and of suiphete
of ammonia 77 pounds. These, it mnay be mentiened, are practlcally the two most valuable
substances obtained fronl the first distillation
. . . . Assuming then the value ef crude oil
et present prices, per barrel, te be $0M05 per
gallon-

This was published in 1910.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: The selling price
has more than doubled since.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: That makes my
argument ail the strenger. (Reading):
-and of sulphate of ammenia, at £12 per ton,
as $0.029 per pound, we have as the value of
the sihale tested In Soetland In 1908.
48 United States gallons crude at $0.05.
31.20
2.23
77 pounds sulphate ef ammonia at $0.029.
Bonus fromn gevernment et li cents per
gallon...................0.72
$4.15

That is with regard te the commercial
value of eil shale. What is the cost of
mining? It will net exceed 31 or $1.25 per
ton; perhaps it will be less. For a long
time it will be less, because this shale ta
exposed; Ait t near the surface; and it
surely would net cost $1 te mine cne ton cf
shale by rneans cf an up-to-d,.te excavator.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE: Steani shovel.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: The retorting cf
shale per ton would probably cost-what?
An average cf 40 cents per ton. The manufacture Of the sulphate cf ammonia, one cf
the ether valuable products te which I have
referred, would cost prohably 46 cents per
ton of shale. The.coat would be, in ail,
$1.86. There ia an expenditure cf 31.86 te
produce at lest $4.15, as ahown in the
figures I have given, or perhaps it would
be $6 or $7 at present pricea-a very large

margin of profit, perhaps larger than eccurs
in any other industry that I know cf.
I know this is a very dry suhject, but it
is perhaps fully as important as it is dry.
I have endeavoured te place before you
the desirability of governmental aid te this
industry.
I have sho'wn in the first place the growing
decrease cf the supply cf cil in the world,
and especially on this continent. I have
Hon.

Mr. GIRROIR.

pointed out that the uses to which oil is
applied are rapidly increasing and that 'the
demand is 50 tiie-s what Lit was 20 years
ago. I have shown you that, in Canada we
have immense and valuable deposits of cil
shale; that they exceed in value very mucli
the oil shales. of Scotland, where 'a splendid
industry in this braneh of lnining and retorting has 'been buit up. I have pointed
out what other countries are doing- Britain, Germnany and -the United States. I
have shown you the conmnercial value of cil
shales-how valuable they are -and how
easily they can be mined in this country,
and what a splendid profit there is over
the cost of umining. I have aise indicated
wbuat in my opinion cen be done te provide
employment, for oux' soldiers end develep
eur interests generally .in this coun.try. I
repeat, whaît I said et the beginning, that
I thinc it should .be the duty of any gevernment, 'that has at heart the interetts cf
the country whîch it governs, to de dts
utxnost te see that the resources cf the
country are thoroughly developed, that every
oprtunity is given fer xesearch into the
value and quan.tity cf these resources, and
that, when the time cornes w-hen development is undertaken and the manufacturing
pro-cesses are begun, thse yeung industries
shall be assîated until they «aTe strong

.
I believe, Sirs, that we have a great future
be'fore us in this country. We have «
country teeming with resources. Only the
mere fringe cf our resources h-us yet been
touched. Ail over the country evidences are
being furnished day by day that undreamedcf treaSUTes in natural resources exist mn
this Canada of ours. This country ia peopled
by the strongest and rucet virile people in
the whole world. This northern climate in
whiich we live makes us energetic and forceful, a.nd ail that is necessary Lis th-at the
Government give the people a guiding hand
and sucb assistance as can be given only
by governments in this regard, and this
ccuntry rwill go on a.nd on accumnulatingwealth, developing industrially, end grow%ing in population, until it ýbe-comes one cf

It is us-eess te think that private enterprise can scîve a problem as large as this.

NEWSPAPER ATTACK ON THE SENATE.
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. P. A. CHOQUETTE: I feel it my
duty to call the attention of the honourable
leader of this House, and the attention of
the Senate as a whole, to an article published on April 27, in the paper called Saturday Night, published in Toronto. As I
understand, it is a good Unionist paper
supporting the Government. The article,
which is headed, "Put the Axe to the Senate
Next," reads as follows:
It was sheer effrontery for Sir James Lougheed, the Government Leader in the Dominion
Senate, to declare that this discredited legislative body "stood as a bulwark against the
clamour, the agitation and' the caprice of the
public." This high-falutin' utterance was made
In defence of the action of that vast majority
of Senators which insisted on handing over
the streets of Toronto to a gang of electric
ringsters.
If it had been any other municipality in Canada whose interests were Involved, the decision would have been the same.
The Senate of Canada is unquestionably a
'bulwark." as Sir James Lougheed says, but a
bulwark for the defence of every selfish cor-g
porate group which desires to exploit the
natural resources of Canada for their private
benefit and for every enemy of public ownership of publie utilities.
"Upon what meat is this our Caesar fed
that he has grown so great?" What is the
history of Senatorial appointments in this
country? Those Senators, w'ho are not political
"Las-beens," put out of the way because they

The Federal, Senate Is, without
doubt, the most irresponsible, the Most unrepresentative and the most Incompetent legislative body In the world. The Senatorial abuse
is in reality a much greater menace to the
well-lbeing of Canada than that In connection
with titles. Some fine day It will te rectified,

which

emanated from the lips of Sir James Lougheed,
who unquestionably voiced the egotism of most
of his colleagues.

I will add only this, that I have been
personally very often slandered in newspapers, and I have never taken notice of it;
but when I see such an article in a Government organ, slandering the honourable
leader of this House and the Senate as a
whole, especially those Senators appointed
since this Government came into power, I
Jeel it my duty to call the attention of the
leader of the House and the Senate in
general to this utterance.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The only
thing I have to say to my honourable friend
is that it is news to me to learri that the
paper in question is a Govern-r.et organ.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE: This paper bas
been slandering Quebec as it slanders the
Senate in this article, and has always supported the Union Government.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:

No, no.

Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE: That is my
information, and if honourable gentlemen
will read it they will see that that is the
case.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: I think the honourable leader of the Government should go
further. Notwithstanding that the paper is
not a Government organ, I think that on
behalf of himself, and especially on behalf
of the Senate, he should repudiate the
whole article. J should thin-k that ought
to be done, especially as the honourable
leader says the paper is not a Government
organ. If I were in his position, I certainly
would denounce the sciibbler who wrote
tha.t infamous article. I believe the word
" infamous " is almost parliamentary. But
anyhow, on mny own behalf-I am a nobody
-I protest against the twopenny-halfpenny
scribbler who wrote that article in the
public press of Canada.

But this repeal shall not affect the vension

That 'wiil save that vested riglit that a

is to abolish the second sy8tem, ci pensions,
and to return ta the previons system. that
lasted so rnany years, at the same tirne
saving. ail vested interests.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: If we adopt this
Bill, how -wiii the law stand in regard ta
judges who are incapacitated by reason ot
iliness?
Hon, W. B. ROSS: It leaves the oid fifteen-year systern intact. I want now ta
pass ta section 2, which dealq with the
duties of the judges. That a-atter was discussed at a goad deai of length, and 1 think
with a great deai of intelligence, by bonuurabie gentlemen on bath aides o.f th~e
House last winter. Prior ta 1906, the year
of the Revised Statutes, which contain the
Judges Act, judges in the province of New
Brunswick, for* instance, received $4,000 a
year, but by the Judges Act af that year
their salaries were raised ta $6,000. A carrespanding increase took place ail over Canada. It wa-s a very large increase; 'I arn
flot ssying it wss too large, but a 50 per
cent increase ia very substantial. There
had. been compiaints made that -the judges
were underpaid, and that here and there
they were engaging -in outside work and
negiecting the reguiar duties ai their office;
hence it was pravided by section 33 of t.he
Judges Act, part of the sarne Act that raised
their salaries, that the duties of a judge'e
office would occupy hi& whoie time. I arn
sorry ta say there -are cases of individual
judges who are not devoting ta their judicial duties their whole time, but are drawing salaries ou'tside their judiciai salaries,
and I arn tld that in one or two of those
cases this outsîde work is interfering with
the proper discharge of their judicial
duties.,
Hon. Mr. TESSIER: Were those cases
reported to the Minis'ter of Justice?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I do not know, but
if sa there was nothing donc.
Hon. Mr. POWER: That iB the usual
thing.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: This practice continues iromi year ta year; and in one or two
csses where judges have been spoken ta on
the subject, they have heen quite independent about it, saying they did not care anything at ail about the Aiet af Parliarnent,
and were gaing ta do as they pieased.
Another thing that ha&caused a good deal
of ýcomplaint, nat only pn the part ai the
generai public but among the judges theîii-

selves, je the growing habit of appointing
judges to commissions. Here and there a
judge is appointed chairmen ol a commission to revise the statutes of a province;
in another place one ie appointed te investigate question A, another to look into question B, etc.
Hon. Mfr. CRO)QUETTE: The Canadien
Nortihern -railway stock.
-Hon, W. B. ROSS: Thet custom, besides
taking judges from. the regular work of their
oilice, kas delayed and impoded the administration of justice.
tHon; Mfr. W)ORAN: There is no doubt
about that.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: But it has done more;
i'i has created very coneideérable discontent
axnong the judges theeneelves. Take the
Bupreme <>Ôu1t, consisting of five judges;
t -may -be thet those five are juet able,
by workinig hard, to tvertake ail the duties
of the court, but one of them is appointel
to a commission, say, on the work of revising the statutes, arxd goes off for the
greater part of three years. The effect cf
that i.s to throw the judicial work on the
four, remaining judges. Thore are judges
who eay that wbile they are willing to do
their share, and even to do extra work
provided aIl fil>.judges are working, they
object to aitting np at nights in order to
overtake the extra work imposed on thom
when oe of their number je off on an
easier job, and, in addition to drawing hie
full salary as judge, je also i receipt of
a large salary as commissioner, go that,
while doing less work than the remaining
judges, he is drawing more than double
the pay.
That practice oannot continue
without produeing dissatiefaction.
One
judge who mentioned it to me said: "Fromn
this time on 1 arn going to stop doing
extra work in overtinie, for hore is a man
who ie drawing double salary and having
very easy work." Now, it le time that
that customn ceased.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: Would my honourable friend tell us whether the propbosed
amandment'cf section 2 ie in exactly the
,same words as the section that we adopted
last yaarP
Hon. W. B. MMS: It je not quit. the
same. You wiil remember that last year
the honourtable gentlemen from Welland
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) complained that the
wording of the amendment we had at that
time would prevent the appointment of a
judge as arbitrator i a labour dispute, and
he said that labour men would not accept

m

anyone but a judge as umpire. I worked
on what we did last year, but the language
is reconstructed so as to eneet this objecà
tion.
Hon. lMT. BELOOURT: But provision was,
mxade last year te ellow judgee te act on
a board of conciliation and investigation
under the (Induetrial Disputes Investigation Act. You deal here with both the
Conciliation Act and the Industrial Disputes Act. They are two different Acte.
Was either cf themn excepted in the provision we adopted last yearP
Hon, W. M. ROSS: No. Last year 1
thought there rwas enother general Act
relâting te labour which would enable tihe
Governmn4, to make the appoîntment irrespective of thie legislation we were passing; but.,on checking it over this year 1
coaicluded that I was perhaps mistaken, in
.that, and that w. had better isert bore
the namez of the Acte.
Hon. Mfr. BEICOURT: For my part I
arn not satiefied to make that exception;
and, uniese my hoeiourable friand has eomne
very good. reasons te advance, it is in
my mind to oppoeeit. 1Ido not see why a
judge ashould b. appointed as umpire under
either of those Acts.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: 0f course, it would
be for the House to decide.
'HEon. Mfr. CLORAN:
What le ycur
opinion on it?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: 0f course, the question of eettling labour disputes je one of
paramount impoitanee to the people of
this country; and if it be a fact, as stated
by the honourable gentleman from Wel-

land, that labour m-en wil1

not listen to

any man orther than a judge being appointed, we may have to bow to the circumeêtances of the country and the importence of the subject and allow an appointment -of -that kind te b. made.
Hon. Mfr. BELCOURT: -But we- must
exercise some indepanident judgmient about
the, matter, and if my honourable friend
has some gocd reason to support the exception created in section 2, I ehouId like
to hear it.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I have stated the
only reason I have-that the labour union&
of the country will not tâcoept anyce
other than a judige as an unupire in settling
a trade dispute. Ilf that is the tact, I thin-k
it is of sufficient importance to mahe the
exception. I may be wrong, but that is
my reason, and the only reason I-have.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DAVID: Laet year 1 insis4ed
on .having the exception inserted in regard
ta commissions appointed to in.vestigate
municipal matters, because there ia a -laiw
in our statutes providing that on a petltion. signed by twenty-five citizens a judge
will*be authorized to make an investigation into the, matter complained of du
the petition. I mention that in order te
justify the position taken by.the bonour.
able gentleman (Hon. W. B. Ross).
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: Would the honourable gentleman tell me whether be ia in
favour of the dietum, of the labour unions
ini regard to this matter-that tbey will net
aeýcept any other ar'bitrator?
HEon. Mr. THOMPSON: Whether« he is
in favour of the position they take?
Hon. Mr. OLORÂN: Whether it is a
proper demand to put up to, an ind-ependenit
Parliamen4--that they rwill not aocept any
axibitrator but a judge? Suppose I arn a
labour man, and I am ini a union, and looking over the beach I can oee ndbody 'whaqn
I would select.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Yeu eau go outside.
Hon. Mr. CLjORAN: No; y'ou have just
etated that the labour unions have put it
up to t)he Goverament, that they will accept nobody but a judge.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: No, I .did not say
that the labour people had put anything urp
te the Governanent. I Gaid that the bonourable memiber for Wel.land, representing the
laibour men, stated that ta bis knowledge
labour mon wo'uld not ac.cept as an umpire any mnan oither than a judge. It is
not a m-atter of compulsion to them te
take a judge; if the laibour men wish a
rnerchant, a doctor, or some other man te
act as an umrpire they ean choo&e one. We
are only giving the'judge liberty te act as
an umpire if lie is asked for, and if the
Governonent assent.
Hon. Mr. CIORAVN: I ain rwith you in

Why the boncuraible senator Irmm Halifax
should raise a point of order wben we are
in a farxnily discussion ie more thaai I can
understand.
Hon. W. B. BOSS: Section. 33 of the
Judges Act is beaded "Judges flot to, engage
in 'business," and reais.
No judge of the Supreme Court of Canada or
of the Exchequer Court of Canada or of any
superior or county court in Canada shall, either
directly or indirectly as director or manager
of any corporation, company or flrm, or in any
other manner whatever, for himnself or others,
engage io any occupation or business other
than hie judicial dluties- but every euoh judge
shah1 dievote hlmiselt e«.olus1vely to such ludicWa
duties.

A large nuimber of judges bave gone ente
the Bench with that statute before them,
and there are ot-hers who accepted an
increase of salary, amounting te 50 per cent
-in somne cases te more-and I think that
;we are entitled te expect more perfect
loyalty both in the spirit and in the Iaw
to the Act of the Parliament from the
judiciary than from any other class in the
community.
Section 3 of tbe Bill proposes an addition
ta section 33 of the Act. It is put i with
.a view of keepîng tab'on those judges wbo
do not obey the provisions of section 33.
Subsection 2 of section 33 is te read:

Hon. Mr. CLOIRAN: As I was interrupted
by the honourable gentleman fromn Halifax
(Hon. Mr. Po-wer), now that I have the
floor and amn free to express rny opinion,
I may say tihat I thoroughly agree with the
honourable gentleman from Middleton
<Hon. W. B. Ross) who has introduced
this legisiation.
It .has libecoine neceseary by reason of the legisiation which
was passed by this House and by the
House of Gomirnons in 1905. In that year
the Judges Act was presented to the House
of Commons by the Minister of Justice, Sir
Charles Fitzpatrick. There were quite a
numbe.r of senators on 'the Government aide
ait that tim-e who objected to the legisiation.
It was introduced under cover, to serve the
interests of one man, the ex-Go-verner of
Quebec.
Hon. Mr. CROQUETTE: Oh, no. You
are mistaken there.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: I amn right. At ll
events, anany foqind fault. with the Bill,
eepecialiy -the section which the honoura-ble
gentleman (Hon. W. B. Boss) is no-w trying
to eliminate from thie Biii, which grants
a full pension to judges who are over se'venty
years of -age. At th.at time we feit that what
has since occurred would occur-that men
who had spent filteen years on the Benc.hgiving valuable services, weie entitled tic
a two thirds' pension, and if alter a year or
two of service they became incapacitated,
but had not reached seventy, to receive
their full salary; and that has led to abuse,
which I understand the honourable gentleman from Middleton is trying to correct.
I thoroughly agre-e with him, and, arn in
favour of the Bili -in that, regard. I amn aiso
in favour of his ainendments tW the old
Judges Act. I ithink they are in uine with the
proper conduct of the judiciary in this country, and I £ail to see that any opposition
at thia time would be advisabie. The honcurable gentleman rnay have had an opposition of two-thirds cf this House last
year, but I hope that this year he 'will nieet
with the approbation of three-thirds.

*On section 5-money, how allotted:
Hon. Mr. POWER: Attention was called
to th-is clause 'when the Bill was at its
aecond reading, and I should like to know
whether the honourable leader of the Govern.ment has seen his wsy te improve it.
The point that I tried te mnake vas that
this left the whole question in a very hazy
condition and that, considering also clause
8. it was very doubtful whether the provinces, or so>me of them, would get anything
,at ail. The 'Bill te aid agriculture, which
we dealt with a few years ago, provided a
definite aggregate surn, te be divided among
the provinces in~ proportion te their population. I think that would be the riglit
thing to do in this case 'too. As the Bill
is uiow, the Government and the people of
any province will no>t kno-w to what amount
of money they are likely te be ent.itled, and
I think they should know that. It ought
not te be very difficult to provide that when
a province does not epend money itsel it
shahl not get any money fromn the Dominion

not think it is calculated to help in the
establýishment cf these empicymen-t offices.
It needs to be amended. in fact.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I arn very
sorry 1 cannot sec it in the saffna light as
my honourable friend. It seems to me that
the language àis very explicit, and that it
-would be very difficuit to explain what is
meant in more terse and more lucid ianguage than that of section 5. The provision
as te the total expenditures of ail -the provinces practically prevents one province from
contracting in any year an expenditure the
hall of which would be equivs.lent to the
entire vote which has been mnade for that
year. Consequenity the total expeniditures
o! ail the provinces will have to be first
taken into consideration. Then, as te a
province not expending anything, b~ut aisking for its ipro. rata share, my honourabie

Hon. Mr. BOSTOGK: When this Bill was
being discussed on the second reading a
question was raised about the clearing
housel in Ottawa for the carrying out of
this work. Some honourable gentlemen
were then inclined to think that a considerable expense would be incurred by the
Government ini providing a clearing house
for ail the provinces. Caxi my honourable
friend give us any further information in
regard to that matter?

Hon.. Mr. POWER: Yes.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOU'GHEED: "But in
no case shall the allotmnent to a province
exceed the amount expended for the maintenanice of employment offices by such
province." It seema to me that it would
be difficuit, if flot impossible, to improve
on the language.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Section
5 provides that the sums mentioned in sec-.
tinn 4 shail beexpended errtirely in the
provinces. Any expense incidentai to the
maintenance of the central office will of
course be paid from an entirely separate
fund. Either it will be voted by Parliament
or it will be paid out o! the consolidated
revenue fund in any event. If my honourablc friend will look at the beginning of section 5 hie will observe the provision:
The

moneys

appropriated for

shall be allotted and paid to the

governments of

the respective provinces.
So the whole o! that money will have to
be distributed amongst the provinces.
ýSection 5 was agreed to.
On section 6-payments conditional upon
agreement between Minister and Pro-ànce
and approval:
Hon. Mr. BO-STOCK: Section 7 provîdes:
(a) That the offices shall endeavour to fill
situations iu ail trades and for both male and
female emploYees;
(b) That the offices shall rake such returus
and submait to such inspection as the Minister
may requtre.
My honourable friend bas stated that this
Bill is very largely the outcome of the con'ference 'between the Dominion Government
and the prime ministers of the provinces
which was held a short time ago. 1 presume
that those two conditions were agreed to on
that occasion and that the agreement wiil
be practically along those lines.

On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into Commsittee on Bill 64,
an Act to arnend the Indian .Act. Hon. Mr.
McLean ini the Ohair.
On section 1--will of Indian devising
property to be aproved; land devised or
bequeathed to non-'resident to, be sold:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Wbat is the neces.
sity of the change in the 1mw in this ca6e?.
Hon. Bir JAMES WjUGHEED: The explanation. la
is: The worde struck out
are somewlist inconéitent witb the provisions *of sections 26 sud 28 cf the existing
Act and have been the cause of some confusion and ddfficulty. Under tii section
as it stands a testatrix cannot devise property to ber son or bro'ther if they happenl to
be memibers of anotber band, wbile if se
aho<uld die initeatate such Sn would sbare
in the estate under the provisions of
section 26, or sucb brother would ahare in
the estate under the provisions of section
28. There is also tbe question as to whether
under these sections there is an implied
right of a person wbo is not a member of
the band and who shares in the distribution
of la.nd of an estate, to reside on such land
on the reserve. Section 25 In particulsar
bas been the source of sorne difflculty. The
following is a case in point. An Indian
residing ait Caugbnawaga about two years
before his deatb asked bis sister, wbo had
.married a white mnan and had therefore
ceased. te be a meruber of the band, te corne
witlh ber huaband and small family to
live with hirn and take care of him. At bis
deatb he willed bis bouse and lot and
other property to this sister, who continued
te re-side on the property with ber buaband
and family. -Complaint bais now been made
against this busband, and bis removal frorn
tbe reserve bas been asked for. If he alone
were removed, an injustice would be done
te tbe family: the wife refuses to go, clarning
that ehe bas a right te reside on the land
regularly bequeatbed te ber under the
provisions cf section 25.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOOK: Will this legislation

On Section 4-irection -of expenditure of

mfgyht be involved in impressing upon the
Indians the neoessity for a system of drainage, and it was tbought ithat the Govecrnment should take a matter ol tbat kfnd

Section 2 twas ag-reed te.
On section 3--licenýses in British Columbia
for boats and 'buyers olf resh salmon:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Apparently in British Colum~bia a difficulty has
been ex*perienced, arising through un-licensed boats either biiying fresh salmon in
close se.ason, or buying salmon caught outside of territoirial waters. It is therefore
desirable thiat ne boats should be engaged
in amy kind of fishing under the Act uiles
they are licensed. lt seems te me tohat that
will give the department control over the
boats, and thue prevent illicit fIshing and
illicit handling of fish.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY.- And the license lee
will be nomninal.
Hon., Sir JAMES iLOUGHEED: Very
reasonable, anyway.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: As I understand
this section, it really %leaks with the situation of any boat coming along and buying
freali saLmon from the men who are fishing,
say, at the mouth of the Fraser ri-ver.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHIELD: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BOeTOOK: 'But any,.boat, a
trawler or some other kind, can corne and
buy fish from those fishermen, pra-,icallý

restrain as far as possible illegal fishing
thrcough an arrangement between, fisheirmen. Engagements may be entered into
with boats or boatmen over 'whoni the department has no control, and thus they
are able te carry eut successfully their
illegal pr.'ictices.
)Hon. Mr. CROSBY: It is a protection
to the bona fide fishermen.
-Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The people who
are carrying on fishing are already lioensed
i oe form or another, and if they- are
doing illegal flshing the Government can
get after themn by taking away their license.
The licanse is granted te the icannery, each
oannery having a license for so many boats,
Hon. Sir .TAD.iE

LOUGHEHD.

and the individual boat-owner is also able
te get a license. Therefore, if they are
carrying on illegal tisbing operations, the
remedy is for the Government to take away
their licenses.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is not
limited te the fisherman himself; it extends
te storage and packing plants, and se on.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Upon reading the
section it seemed te me thak it was rather
in the interest o! the food controller that
it would- give him eWntrol over fresh fish.

practically the whole industry under. -the

Hon. Mr. BOSTOOK: 'My -honourable

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHFIED: I cannot
eay anything more than that the department bas learned that uxilicensed boats are

For instance, in the close seasens, what is
there te prevent lioensed fishermen from

put up the sign "Dealer in Germaàn goods."
My honourahie friend is too honest flot to
admit that the purpose of the Bill is
indirectly to prevent something which we
do not dare to prohibit-namely, trading
in German goods. If a man had what I
might cail the courage to put up a sign
like that, every window in his store would
be smasbed within an hour. Such wouid
be the resuit not only in Ontario, but even
in Quebec now, because such a sign would
be a provocation to the public.
Let us consider the question from another
point ci view. My honourable friend must
know that at present German goods can
ho bough't in the United States only
because they have been ixnported there
fromn Germany. Only hast week a friend of
mine, a druggist in Québec, was tel-ling me
about trade in German goods in this
country. He named three or four kinds of
dyes and medicines-I forget the nameswhjch could be obtained only in Germany,
and which were imported into Canada fromn
the United States, beeause they could siot
ho imported directly fromn Germany. What
would be the effect of this proposed ]aw
in such a case? Suppose a druggist requires
something which ie produced only in
Germany, Bomething which is absolutely
necessary, perhsips needed for medicinal
purposes. Will the law make provision for
that? If the druggist can.not get such goods
fromn the United States and must buy these
Çxerman good-s for the sake of the publie,
he wihl be required to put up a sign:
"Dealer in -German goods." Wehh, I really
do not think that is sensible.
But there also is another point. This Bill
is contrary to the principle of British law,
because it would declare a man guilty if
by mistake. or unknewi-ngly. *he bought
German goods from the United States. We
are on lriendly terms with the United,
States. A dealer may send an order to the
States for -somegoods--dyes, etc.- and may
receive themo in bis store without knowtng
where they were manufactured.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTGN: This is
the principle of the Customs Act.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE: That may ho.
The Customs Act is a special Act.
So I say that, as we bave alTeady a law
which prevents trading witb the enemy,
the proposed measure is not a good law to
put on t-he statute book. If my honourable
friend proposed that the law sbould remain
in effeet only during the period of the war,
or that after -the war it ehouhd ho repealed
there might be sometbing in hi&contention;
but if the Bill does flot so provide it will
ho -a permanent I.aw, and those Who are
willing, or obliged. tu trade with Germany
will ho at once considered guilty.
Honourable gentlemen, I f ully realize
that, it is not an agreeable duty to objec
to this Bill, iand I repeat that as a private
citizen I bave not-the leasit objection tu
,its bein- put on the statute book of Canada,
but I think that in passing such legilation
w-e would ho more loyal than the King,
more ioyal1 to the Allies than the President
of the United States. There is no such extr.aordinary law in the United States nor
in England. Those are my objections tu
this measure, and the honourable gentleman, as a fair minded man, will flot impute
any wrong motive tu me for ma.kmg these
few remarke. I trust that I shail not be
told that there is sometbing behind them.
I repeat that persmnahly I would not oppose
the Bill; but, es a legisiator, as a meanher
-of this bonourable Bouse, I cannot support
it.

H1on. RAOUL DMoeURAND: I was slow
to rise because I thougbt the representative

flot be allowed to profit by this crime. The
lesson which must be taught to the Germans
is that war ia not a profitable trade; and,
as Germany has gone into this -business
to expand lier commercial domination, it
is but just that instead her trade be made
to suifer. Surely ail Canadians will agree
that German goods should be boycoibted
alter lhe wasr. I do flot agree altogether
with my honourable friend from Granville
<Hon. Mr. Choquette), who says that we
shahl be obliged after the war 4.0 deal with
Germany. President Wilson has indlicated
to us a mneans by which Germany may bo
foreed ta accept the law of the Allies as 'La
its future behaviour in its relations with the
world. President Wilson has said that the
league of nations which will be established
to preven-t a recurrenoe of .such a cals.mity
may impose economic sanctions 4.0 its
deciaions ag.ainst those nations which may
refuse to accept them. In other words,
President Wilson haî intimated that if a
nation refuses to acoept the regulations
which will be devised in order to limait
armaments and to submit future quarrels
to arbitration, that nation should be penalized by some fiscal Èegislation. I foresee the
day when some restrictions may bo imposed
by the Allies iand by aur Parliament in
our commercial dealinga with -Germany.
'he only weak point of my honourable
friend's action lies in the presentation of
his Bill et this moment. I fear that ho wdll
be met by this suggestion fi-cm the Government: <'Wait tili the 'treaty oft peace is
signed; we are noit sure (hat any such legislation may not run couniter ta some special
clause of that treaty."
Hon. Mr. POWER: But would not the
termis of the treaty prevail?
Hon. Mr. DANDURANID: The terms of
the treaty of peace would prevail in spite
of any legisiation that -we might pass today; and I am impressed with the thought
that we may be somewhat too previous in
enacting legislation which may be modilied or superseded by the treaty of -peace.
When Great Britain, and I hope Canada
by its side, with its official representatives,
sit et the table where the Allies and the
enemies will meet and sign a treaty of
peace, the eommercial and economic statua
of the nations will be settled at tbe sae
time; and I wouid dislike having to face
such a document, which will most probably
ha laid bafore this Parliaent for endorsetion, if it did set et nought the lagislation
we might pass to-day. This is the principal objeution, and perhaps. the only ona, 1

at the present moment. I wiil await the
opinion of the Government, which wili
some day have the responsibility of carrying on negotietions, jointly with the othar
Governments, with the enemy nations, ta
say whather iL is opportune that this legislation should now go forward.
1 endorse every word which my. honourable friend has said as to the poss'ibility of
the Germans invading our market and underselling the gouds of the world, in very
many lines, if the treaty which wa will aigu
wi'th themet the end ofthie war allows them
the open dacr. A few day. after the war
was declared, I was informed by an important druggist of Montreal that et oea
time he tbought three times more from
France than from Gennany, but that practically ninety-five per cent cf the large
stock 'which he had on hie shalves at that
moment came from Germany. He expiained
to me that commission agents, coming direct
from Germeny, had sat down with l'im and
had gone through the whole Eist of things
wh'ich ha wanted, and had satisfied him
thet from ten to fifteen per cent could be
made by the druggist if -lie b.ought hi.
goods from them. He gave a large order,
end the termis of payment were wonderfully easy, running into twelve.mQnths and
more.
,My honourable friand states that ha has
met people who have said that as soon as
the war 'was over they -would as likely buy
German-mada goods as other goods. 1 may
state that two years ago I heard large
wholesale dealers in the metal trade discussing this question and stating that they
would be buying metai goods from Gxermany within six months after the close of
the war. When we showed our surprise
anid indignation. et such a atatement, we
were answerad that if thay did not do that
they would ho forced. te stop their business
and close their stores, for the simple reason
that others would do it, that the Americans
would buy, and thet they would be undersold by from twenty ta twenty-five par
cent; and a man who is undersold by that
muci lied bettar close bis store. T was told
then that the Germans had succeeded in
making Sheffield goods with the most reputabie names cf Sheffield on their wares,
aud thet those goods were beiug sold of
as good quality as aimilar goods made in
Sheffield, and et 4.wenty per cent cheaper
than the English goods. Under these conditions, in a few months aftèr the close
of the war, those dealers would be obliged
ta buy thasa Germen goods or go out (>f
business. 1 ramember asking in reference

ta quite a number of lines how it was that

the Germans could underseil the British
makers. It was then explained ta me that
their chemists had àucceeded in using and
turning ta profit every by-product, thereby
helping ta reduce the total cast af production. Whatever may be the cause, the
fact is there, aud I quite realize 'what incentive there is for my honaurable f riend
ta inave in the matter. I feel as he does,

PRODUCTION OF PETROLEUM IN

Hon. JAMES DOMVILLE moved:
Thst in thie opinion of tbis House. In vlew of
thie contiuued world-wide iucrease In thie consuraption cf crude petroleum cil and Its maufactures, iuoluding fuel cil, gas oil and gasolene.
In view of the fact that up te date Canada bas
requlred to Import thie major portion of Canada's
consurnption of crude coù end of the manufacture
of crude cil In vlew of 'the fact that there la

He said:, 1 withheld this motion fer a

As bte House has had a very clear exposition cf it, I think tbat the-e is ne object

SENATE

the April number of the Review of Reviews,
which àillustrates the position of l2his matter
in the United States. It is headed: "The
Rich Oil Shales of Colorado, Utahi, Wyoming and Nevéada." It state& that questions
have been asked about the depletion of the
national fuel resources, and then goes on
te say :
Mr. G. E. Mitchell, of the Urnited States Geological Survey, answers these questions in the
National Geographic Magazine, and the answer

of the war, and that fer generations to corne
wlll enabie the United States to maintain its
suprelnacy over the rest ef the world ias a producer of crude oil and gasolene and lncldentally
of ammonia as a hlghly valoable by-product.
We have discovered that we possess mountain
ranges of rock that wlll ylield 1billions '0of barrels
of oil. For niany years travellers golng west
through the Grand River Valley of Colorado
and looking Into the great Ulnta Basin of
Eastern Utah have looked from the windows
of their Pu8imnan cars on the far-stretched, miles
and miles of the Book Cliff Mountains, littie
reallzlng that In these and the adjoinlng mountains, plainly exposed to vlew, lay the greatest
cil reservoir lu the country-the cil shales o!
Colorado. Utah, Wyoming and Nevada.

That very properly applies to this country.
We have travelled through beautiful Nova
Scotia and elsewhere, and we have not
realized what was about us. The article
continues:
Frein recent Investigations o! the Geological
Survey It appearw that our ohl shales are far

From recent explorations it appears that the
mountains of Colorado alone are able to yield
36,000,000,000 barrels of shale oil!
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE.

I do not thînk I need read this further.
I amn only tryîng to point out the fact' that
the United States sees the necessity of
securing fuel cil. We want it for our fleet,
and for various industries, and if we have
it in our shale deposits, we should secure
it. I amn simply placing this matter before
the Goverument in a friendly way; we have
no power-because we we&e beaten outto ask tlhern to look into the matter. We
ehould ascertain what can be done to
develop these large bo>dies of oil shale in
this country, and endeavor to, conserve
them, and in this, way prevent millions
of dollars goinýg out -of the country. I
think that this is a matter worthy of
consideration, and that I amn juatified, in
asking the leader of the Government,because we look to hlm in these mattersto see whether something cannot be done
to bring a knowledge of the oil resources
of -Canada before the world.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED. Yes.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: They will ail have
the right ta vote.
Hon. Mr. POWER: Before the question
is put, 1 direct attention to the proviso,
which. I think Ghould flot be in this para.
graph at ail. If we are going to have fernale
suffrage, I t.hink the right thing- is to put
women on the saine footing as men; but it
wi.ll be noticed that this proviso puts the
women ini a very much more advantageous
position than the men: -"provided that a
marrîed woman -- I do not abject to that"1or an unmarried daughter living with her
father or mother." There may be a couple
married. The husb-and has a vote, his wife
bas a vote, and then, if they have half-adozen daughters, these daug-hters ail have
votes, even though the daughters -are not
qualified in the way of property or otherwise
-in such a way as -would qualify thern ta
vote if they were maie. I think, honourable
gentlemen, that that is going rather too far.
I think that we should have some regard
for 'the unfortunate maie sex, who are to be
walked over in this way, and this proviso
should ho etricken ont.
Hon. 'Air. DAVID.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

Or the moth or.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It would
depend entirely upon the franchise. If we
have a uniform franchise throughout the
Dominion, the probabilities are entireiy in
favour of ail being placed upon an equal
footing. If we should adopt the -franchise
o! any province having- a property qualification, it would o! course be necessary
for the sons ta have thaît qualification,
provided they are not, penmitted otherwise ta vote.
It ail reaolves
iteel!
inta a question of the franchise in the
province.
Hon. Mr. DANDtTRAND: Weil, take the
franchise in my own province. The son
has a right ta vote if the father bas property which. would qualif.y two persons ta
vote; or, if hie has two sons and his property is, sufficiently valuable ta qualify
three voters, then two sons are entitled ta
vote. It may happen thai tho father has
not the necessary qualifications and that
the sons are flot qualified in their own right.
Thon, under this legisiation as it is now
framed, the daughtera will ail hie entitied
ta vote whilo it miay happen that a son, or
two sons, remaining at homo, the brothers
o! those daughters, will piot be entitied ta
vote.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I am very much
impressed with the arguments of my honourable friend from Halifax (Hon. Mr.
Power.) You are discriminating there in
favour o! women; that is, in those provinces where property qualification is required, women without any qualification
may have a right ta vote and a man withont such qualification will not have that
right. It seems to me that this is going
beyond anything that anybody ever dreamed
of. We know a a fact that there are provinces where property qualification is required, or, at ail events, incarne qualification; and in this Bill you are giving the
rig-ht ta vote ta women who have no incarne

MAY 2, 1918

*

nor any property qualification whatever.
As my honourable friend from De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) says; in the samne
f.amily there .may be a daughter having the
right to vote and a son who is deprived of
it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The property qualification, in those provinces,
where it obtains, is se simple that it is
merely nominal. It is difficuit to conceive
of conditions that would preclude men who
have reached their majority from having
a sufficient qualifictiorn te entitie them to
exercise the -franchise ini those provinces.
In the case of a young -man, the probability
is en.tirely in favour of hie having pro-perty,
whereas the probability 'is against the
daughters having any qualification, or
having any intention of acquiring property.
Men almost invariably acquire proporty
fer the purpose of exercising their franchise,
in the one or two provinces where the property qualification existe.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I recognize
that a man of 21 is generally a wage-earner,
and as such he will -be entitled to vote, cin
my province at ail everite; but 1 have in
niind the cases ci many young men who
will nob be entitled te vote although they
are perhaps among -the most capable of
giving an intelligent vote. I refer to University etudents-law and mediesi etudents
-who in some instances will not obtain
their diplomas belore they axe 23 or 24
years old, and who will not be wage-earners,
but will have to rely upon the qualifications
of their fathers in order to obtain a vote.
If the father ie not se qualified as te give
a .rig'ht te vote to the son, the son will be
without a vote, while the daughters will be
entitled te the franchise.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: Gan the honourable

Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE: The property
qualification ie $200, and the wage qualification is $300. Then 'there is a rent qualification of $20 a year.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: As a matter of fact,
it is practically univereal -suffrage.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The minimum
qualification is very low.
Ho-n. W. B. ROSS: It is se low that we
are really eplitting hairs, I think.

,by ýthe honourable Senater front De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) is a very good
one, and I think the honourable leader of

the Governmen-t ought to take it into. consideration. He ought not to supprees the
vote cf the -moet intelligent portion of the
population, the young students between the
ages cf 23 and 24.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE: They will have
the right to vote. Under the provincial
law etudents have the right to vote, if
they live with their father.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: But all of them are
not living with their fatiher. Anyhow, a
principle ie at stake. If there is only one
student who would ibe deprived of the vote,
-let us save the rights and the liberty cf
that one. There are many students who
-are enabled te attend coflege or the university by working on borte during the
summer monthe, as waiters and so on.
These boys, many of them, have no homes,
and they should not be deprived of their
-vote by any law. AIl this discussion comes
down to the point cf the motion of which
I gave notice. Let the mother vote for
ever child in the family under 21.
Hon. Mr. CHÔQUETTE: My honourable
friend is mistaken. Under the law of the
province cf Québec a young man studying
at college or university who lives with his
father is qualified te vote. If he does net
live with hie father, but earns $300 a year,
-he is qualified by himsell to vote. Or, if
he rente a room in the city and pays $20
a year rent, he has the right to vote. Sa
I do not o-bject on that account. But what
I. du oppose is the giving cf the vote
to uninarried daughters. What will be the
lif e cf the father if his daughters, being
intere§ted in politics, take one side while
he takes the other. Take, for instance, a
man who is supporting the Tory or Unioniet
party and whose wife and three or four
daughters are supporting the other party.
How can they live in the saine bouse with
him? They will have te separate. I think
my honourable friénd <Hon. Sir James
Lougheed) should have some consideration
for the father of the f amnily.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED. Hie should
observe the injunction in Scripture and
bring Vhem up the way in which they should
go.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE: Well, if he does
that, it will simply mean se many more
votes on the samne aide, and there will be
no difference in the general result. If all
the votes cf one family are for the samne
side, what will be the advantage? In Quebec, cf course, the people are all on the
same side; but we must look after the
interests cf other provinces as well, where

aubstantial than the qualification required
of young men jusf beginning lite, I think
is a proposal that we should consider quite
definifely and distinctly before we vote on
it. So far as I have heard the remarks
thaf bave been made. I feel inclined te
vote for tbe amendrnent. That wou]d make

.MAY 2, 1918
the qualification for a female voter the sane
as the qualification required of a male voter
in any province. I do not believe that the
women will ask, or do ask, 'for anything
better than that. 1 do flot think they are
asking for a qualification which has flot
-been given to men. We ail know what they
have donc duriiig the war; but I do not
think that they wauld want Parliament to
give themn a qualification which is of a
elighter degree than is rcquired of the

Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE: *Does my honourable friend talk about the qualification in

What is the qualification?
-Everybody can vote, .cannot they? This
dace flot interfere with the women's right

Hon. Mm. DAiNrEL: If everybody is qualified to vote there, that will include the
vomen.
Hon. Mr. DOMVILLE: I askcd what the
*qualification was. It is only one hundrcd
dollars. It is a universal vote.
Rlon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: A& I
before pointed out, the pmoperty qualification is practically nominal, and should we
atrike out this proviso, I would venture to
aay that in provinces where the property
qualification obtains seventy-five per cent
-or
more of the <women would be disqualified,
whieh would be entirely contrary f0 the
apirif of this Bill. The fact -is that property invariably stands in the name of the
father; but if is not cQntended for a Moment now a days where universal suffrage
practically exista that the 'man votes by
xeason af hie having that nominal qualification. A man himîf xnay have, the
qualification of $100, which would be infiniteuimal in comparison with a properfy
qualification if substantially and rnaterially
made. You would deprive a 'woman wlib
is possesscd of intellectual qualities and who
may be infinitely more intelligent than a
mnan possessing the $100 qualification,
while at the saine time yon give to hier
sisters in ail the other provinces the right
to
vote.
The property -qualification,
wherever it obtains in Cansda-and I think
*if only obtains in two provinces-is sirnply
a relic of old days, and is not in harmony
with modern conditions. It afeeme to me
absurd that we should import the prop'erty
qualification into this Bill.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
fmiend's argument ie worthy'ai considemation by the provinces where -the property
qualification still exists, but I do not think
we should consider that. We should respedt
the provincial mequirement with regard ta

that if gives the new voters an advantage
over the old votera. I subscmilbe ta my

Hon. Mr. TANNER: I think honourable

rather to protect the young men in the case
where -thec qualification is, a property onc.

where- thé aon qualifies on the father's

Consequently, as I see if, th.i provision «is

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I do not sec

that woulld -recompense the women of this
country for the great sacrifices they have
made during this war, and realizing the
worthiness of the women, so that tae nrndh
can net bie done for them, at the samne time
1 have grave doubts whet.her the granting
of the franchise ta the wemen of this country is going to be the blessing that rnany
Iseem ta think it will be. The splendid
work done by the women of this country,
-however, commends itself ta al, and I
amn sure that every man ini this Hause or
out ai it feels thet the women ci Canada
are at least their equals, and in mainy cases
their superiars. At the sanie time, 1 do
net think it i. going ta be -a blessing nor
a kindnese ta drag the wamen into pallitics.
However, as a great many wornen seem
ta want the franchise, I wauld bie the last
man ta deny them. But I teed qui-te sure we
would net be paying the wormen af Canada
an-y compliment if we placed them iii the
samie poaition as the waxnen tram foreign
lands, whom thie Bill intende ta eut rauohise,. Our aplenddd' wamea who -havemade
such g.reat eorlifices ini. givuing their sons,
husbands and brothers ta fight for democratic principles deserve sametluing, lar -better.
The fareign women-Austrians, Germîns,
]Ruesianas, and in fact ail that class from
Sauthera Eurape-were serfs in mast cases,
and neyer enjayed any ai thie civilizing or
Christianizing advantages that the wamen
of Canada have enjoyed. The proposai ta
place these women on the samne high level
as aur own splendid Canadian women is an
insuit ta the intelligence of the age we live
in. It is democracy run wi.ld, and is calculated te do great and lasting injury ta
Canada. Ail these foreign people, muen and
womnen, have been raised in an atmasphere
calculated ta produce the» modern Hun,
who has sbacked the civilized world. with
the awful crimes committed, nlot alone un
aur awn gallant boys, whom they have
treaied worse than any Canadian would

hacked their hands off, eut out their tongues
and, nlot sati-sfied with ail this, have
crucified mare than one of aur soldiers.
.The crimes committed by the Austrian
and German soldiers, tram the princes

Peaple who defend the giving of votes ta
theize people prate about their loyalty
during the war. Fear, and fear alone, has
held thase people in check. Evenu in the
face af the risk of being tried for treasan
and abat, as they would have been in their
own country, their attitude or conduct has
been sa dishoyal that we have had ta arrest
thousands of them snmd in-temn them. Eighteen of 'these peo.ple, one of whoin is believed ta Ïbe a spy, were arrested right iinder
the shadow of this Hanse no later than last
.night. Haw anybody can 1irge the enfran chisement ai the women af this.clama
is more than I 'can understand. I contend
that it is a serions mistake ta propose ta enfranchise the women aI those mien, and
place the.n on an equality with the afpendid
women 'of Canada. Su-rely there is a limit
ta what the people aI thia country ought
ta be expected ta bear iii connection with
the -alien enemies within aur bordera.
1 had intended ta move an amendment te
thia clause, seconded by Hon. Mr. Sharpe,
a6 follows:
That sub-clause 2 of clause 1 be amiended by

The purpose of that amendment was ta
make it impossible for Ioreign women coming ta this country atter they are twelve
years of age ta enjoy the right of voting
in this country, and of being piaced on an
equality with the women. of Canada. But,
awing ta the tact that thîs amendment
would only have disfranchised the women

are now on the iists becomes a voter again
-I broug-ht down ta this House a Bill
dealing with- the wbole êubject, which I

that in the western provinces the foreign

three provinces.
Honourahie gentlemen

the position that that .element bas secured

SENATE
i hold that those people ought flot to be
allowed to vote in Canada. I arn quite satisfied that children who corne into this
country at twelve years of age, and twho
are brought up and educs.ted. in thîs country should become votera. It is another
thing-, however, to put into the hands of
t4iese people from alien countries, aouthern
Europe especially, the same privileges as
are enjoyed here by British Canadians or
British-born. The people from those alien
countries have neyer had any training in
reaponsible government, and know nothing
about it; they have no idea, of the sacrednesa of the bal.lot; and I consider that the
placing of a ballot into their banda wornld
be a crime againét the best interests of
this country. I have always contended that
those people should neyer' have been ailowed to use the ballot in this country.
People say to me: " But why did you invite thfem to Canada? Why are those peopie invited here? If they corne hère and
share with yeu in building up Canada,
then they are entitled to the privileges of
Canadian. citizenship." J[ do not agree vith
that at ail.
In Canada we have one of the greateat countries of the 'world in the rnaking, provided
that -Britiash citizena keep control of the
-country.
The danger is that we may let the
control pass out ef our handa. Thouaanda
of our young men have died in Flanders,
fighting for what? Fighting against the
very principles and ideals held. Iby the Austriana and Germans in this country. Those
forei.gners were brought up in. a different atmasphere from ours. We cannot blame
them. If I were living in Germany to-day,
do you flot think I would be just.as strong
a Britisher a.s I amn? Do you flot think that
ail my feelings would go out towarda the
Empire? But though we cannot blame the
Austrians and Germýans in thîs country for
having that feeling, which is in their hearts,
and they cannot help it, yet we can safeguard our own country by refusing to allow
those people the same privileges that our
own people enjoy here.
This is a very important question, one
th.at affects Western Canada perhaps more
than the E.ast, and it is worthy of very great
consideration on the part of this House.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: IVe have an
a'nendment, before us. Should we not dispose
of that before proceeding, unless there.
ia sub-amendment? 1 do not think there je.
~Hon. J. D. TtAYLOR: Mr. Chairman,
speaking to the amendment before the
Committee, 1 think that the honourable
leader of the Government bas not caught
the point which .1 raised. 1 would like to
have, if I can get it1 a clear staternent on
that point, because I think it isa very important. In my view, these words which I have
moved 'to strike out confer on a foreignborn woman a privilege which le expressly
forbidden te a Britieh-born woman under
similar circumstanoea. Therefore I would
like te hear from the -honourable liBader
of the Government whether in bis view
the effeet of these words is to provide that
a foreign-born woman who marries an
enemy alien does not thereby forfeit ber
Britisb nitionality, but would be entitled,
upon taking the procedure provided under
this Act, to a vote.
Hon.. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My reply
te my honourable friend is that thé words
in brackets in line 26 are intended te
presserve ta a woman naturalized British
subjeet, who marries a foreigner, ber Britisb
nationality, whicb she bas acquired by
naturalivation. I do nlot know whether I
make myseif clear.
Hon. J. D. TAYLOR: Yes.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The sanme
principle enters jute paragrapb d in this
way, that under the Naturalization Act as
it is at presenit, if a British woman should
m-arry a foreigner she loses ber nationality.
Consequently the two women, the Britisbborni anid the foreign-born, are placed on
.a parity. Then, the point which my
bonourable f riend, makes, and whicb could
be more intelligently di6cussed under
paragraph dý is -that the application of
paragraph d is limited to the particular
condition mentioned in the .paragiaph.
That point could be met by striking the
word "paragraph" out of line 10 in paragraph d, and substitu'ting the word "section." That would place thern both on a
parity. So if my honourable friend will
postpone his aniendmnent until we corne to
paragraph d, we cau discuss it with much
greater clarity than under parag-raph c,
ibecau6e c is imtended to preserve to the
naturalized British woman, for the purposes
cf voting, hier British na-tionality, even
though she marry a foreigner, and riotwithstanding what may be in the Naturali7zation
Act.
Hon. '.%r. TAYLOR.

Hon. J. D. TAYLOR: I agree with the
honourable leader of the Government ithat
the defeot te rwbiob 1 called attention could
be remedied as be suggests, and, as ail I
want ie a remedy for this defect, I arn quite
content rte witbdraw -my amendment and
to raise the subject again when we reach
paragraph d.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Mr. Chairman, I
beg to move my amendneut. now.
The Hon. tbe CHAIRMAN: Lt je move-d
by Hon. Mr. Sharpe, iseconded by Hon. Mr.
Bradbury, that paragraph c of subsection 2
of the Bull be amended by adding after the
words "British subjeet," in liue 23, the
wolds, "and that sbe le able te read in
English or French any section or sections
of the British North America Act, 1867."
Hon. E. L. GIRROIýR: Honourable gentlemen, I should like to say a few words in
support of the amendment wbich je proposed by the bonourablemnember from Manitou (.Hon. Mr. Sharpe). 1 feel that this
is a case where we from the East can joîn

Mon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, I do not wish to make anything like a speech tipon this subject; and
yet there are more important considerations
involved in the Bill to which an amendmént has just been moved by rny honourable friend frçcm Manitou (Hon. Mr. Sharpe)
than perhaps at firat sight may appear. It
muet flot he overlooked in the first place
that Canada is dependent solely lipon immigration for the settiement of ber vast
areas of land, for the development of ber
resources, and for the building up of bier
nationality. Cc>nsequen-tly any policy whicb
we embody in our franchise -muet %eof the
mnost liberal and mo.st generous character, and mnust not (be restricted by
any narrow confines. It 'must go beyond
* any of the pxejudices which we, durin.the last three or four years, may possibly
have indulged in. We say te the foreigner
in Europe: "The vast areas of our lande

The discretion of the Secretary of State
as te that qualification cannot be questioned; there is ne appeal ag-ainst it; it is
absolute.

I further say that the Secretary

of State, properly exercising the powers
whicb have been vested in him, would
exact-from a foreigner-such a knowledge
of either French or English as would permit
of bis reading the ont language or the

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,

who have already qualified.
Hon. Mr. SHARLPE: Yes.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGILEED: Now, let
us look et the Bull which is before us. It
requires an alien of any of the classes
coming-within the Act-that is, the children
of a naturalized subjeet--shail obtain and
presentTo the offIciai in charge of the preparation or
revision of the votera' lista of the said conatituency a certificat&. under the signature of a

that such femnale person ts of the fuli age of
twenty-one years, has reaided ln Canada a
zuffIcient iength of time and la po8seaaed or
ail requiremnents necessary to entitie her, If
unmarried, to becorne naturalised as a British
subject and that she has taken the oath of
aliegiance to Elle Majeaty.
That is te say, the judge muet satisi y
himself that the applicant possesses aIl the
qualifications required under the Naturalization Act.
Now, take the. cindition refqrred to by
the honourable gentleman frorn Manitou
(Hon. Mr.'Sharpe). Wornen who are alrendy
quaIified to vote in th e western provinces
would not necessarily have to 1becorne
natnralized again in the manner providd
for by this Act. My honourable friends entirely overiook the fact that ai'. those provinces have extended the franichise to there
very wornen. The province of Manitoba, the
province ef Saskatchewan, the province of
British Columbia, and the province of Alberta, have ail extended the franchise te
the very class of women which my, honourable Lriends are oondemning. Surely we
are net geing to import into this Bil the
anornaly cf debarring those woxnen frorn
the exercise of thia franchise.
ïHou. Mr, McMEANS: Was the franchise
given 'before or alter the war?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: In most
cases since the war began. In the provinces
of Alberta and Saskatchewan it wasgve
since the war, and according to niy recellection it was given since the war in British
Columbia.
Hon. Mr. DANDTJRAND. It was given
since the war in Manitoba.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My honourable friends may flot have considered
that, and 1 again point eut that the women
whomn they are now seeking te disqualify
by this arnendrnent are the very wornen te
Hon. Mir. SIIARPE.

wheom those provinces have extended the
franchise, and vho to-day are exercising
it. Let me further point out-it is sirnply
a moral consideration, se te speak--4hat
we ail show a great deal of fear and apprehension at placing certain provisions upon
the -statu'te-book; -we prediot disaster o>f
this, that and the other thin-g; but, experience has taught us, and lias satisfied us
beyond ail perad'ventuire, that those disastrous consequences neyer flow f rom
the legfisiation which at the time it
was introduced may have looked very fearfui. At one tirne it was said that wthen
we permitted. foreignere to corne inta the
western provinces by the huadreds of
thousands they rnay swamrp the whole of
the electorate there, and would raturn their
own people te the legisiatures and to
Parlianient. Notwithstanding the fact that
in those western provinces we mnust have
anywhere frorn half-a-rnillion to threequarters of a million of foreigners, and
notwithstanding the fact that those people
have been exercising the franchise since
they have been there. I do not think that
they have a representative in either the
Federal Parliamnent or the provincial legislatures. If they have any, there would net
be more than one or two. 1 arn not aware
o! any, Consequently I think these
apprehensions are ill-founded. l may sayfurther that, during the struggle through
which Europe is passing, the foreigners in
those provinces who corne from the very
countries which have been convulsed by
war and bloodshed -have, notwithstanding
their very great numbers, preserved rernarka.ble peace and order. I accord to rny
honourable frïends the rnost sincere purpose
in xnoving this arnendrnent for the protection
of our national institutions; yet 1 ask thern
to take a eurvey of the libéral and generous
treatment which we have extended te these
people in the past, and the furthur f act
that is has not been ahused to any rnarked
extent.
Hon. ROBERT WATSON: I just want
te say a word to compliment the leader of the
Hou-se who lias taken this eppor'tunity of
expre"ang bis views, and, I suppose, the
views of the Governrnent. I fully appreciate what sorne honourable gentlemen
have said with regard te our foreign. population. In the House of Jornmons only
two or three years ago -a great deal of
feeling was aroused: it was said that in
the West annexation sentàments wére being
preached by people corning frorn the United
States. That is all dead now; we do net
hear any more about it. I rnay say that

MAY 2, 1918
1 know something of the foreigners of the
West. In the town in which I live, Portage
la Prairie, there are a number of foreignera,
among whoxn are Austrians, and 1 do nat
know of one-and I know Vhern pretty well
-who would Ïbe willing ta go back ta bis
own country and fight agaînst the British
Empire. To give you some idea af the
sentiments of those people, I .may relate
an incident which occurred in my
home town. It was propased ta erect a
a tablet or other memorial in memory of
aur heroes who had gane te the front; and,
withouî being- solicited ai ail, these foreigriers took up a collection of somne $75,
which they handed to the mayor as a -contribution towards the memorial. It is quite
true thai we may have same more desirable
people in Canada, but 1 muai say thai the
chiai- concern oi ihese foreignerB la ta
become Canadian citizens as quiokiy as'
possible, and in ibis, I think the honaurable gentlemen wha are proposing an
education.al test for these people will agree
with me.
The province af Manitoba, from. which 1
corne, was the first province of Canada ta
eniranchise womnen. It put women on the
same footing as men. This was dane by
a very simple method-and, by the way, I
think the Government, if tbey had adapted
the same plan, xnight have introduced a
mueh shorter Bill than the one that is
before us. The qualification under the
Manitoba Election Act is thai a persan
shali be of the male sex, of the fuill age af
twenty-one years, a Britisb subjeet by
bîrth or naturalization, and shall have
resided within the province for one year
and within the electoral division for three
months preceding the date of his application for regaistration. When the franchise
was extended ta the women ail that was
necessary was ta amend the Election Act
by inserting the words -whether male ai
feinale, married or unmarried," and by
striking out the words, «"is of the male sex."
Now, I tbink we should have some harmrony in regard ta the franchise. It seems
ta me that this hand-picking ai electors,
probably for some purpose at sorne tinie, is
not in the best interests of the country. In
Manitoba we have native-born British subjects and we have naturalized British subJecta, and when we extend the franchise ta
thern we should treat ibath in the sanie way.
In the Bill before us the Government bas
seen fit ta say that alien exiemies shall not
vote. 1 think that is a rnistake. 1 know
vcry few so-called alien enemies who are
net in symrpathy with the Allies to-dav-, and

who are nlot contributing-naybe not as
mueh as aur own people, Ïbecause they are
not s0 well off-to the cause of the Allies
at the present tume. In my opinion it
would be a greai mistake ta make any
distinction.
Hon. Mr CLORAN: Before the vote is
taken, I should like ta have an explanation
fram the honourable gentleman wýho moved
the amendmeni.
Does the amendment
provide for the exclusion af &Ulaliens who
cannot speak French or English?
Hon. Mr. SHÂRPE: Ail wamen.
Hou. Mr. CLORAN: Ail?
Hon. Mr. SHAPE: Ail.
Hon. Mr. CLORA2N: Then 1 ask you in

been asked ta deprive ioreign womenRoumanians, gerbians, Italians, anid women
of other allied peoples-oi liberty and
justice and right in this country? What wil
England think to-morrow morning if ibis
amendment is adopted, or eveax proposed?
1 ask you in the name ai the cause for
which we are fighting not ta proeeed any
further with the amiendment. 'If you haài
confined the amendment ta the exclusion of
wamen belonging ta alien enemy countries,
I would be with yen.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: lb iincludes Canadian.
women who cannot read.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Lots ai men cannot
read.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: But we are nlot dealing witb men now. This deals with Canadian
women who cannai read any section or
sections of the British North America Act.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: That.is not the interpretation that is going ta be put upon your
action. The interpretation will go forth
thai Canada is taking action ta disqualify
women of the Allied nations who -are fighting for the same cause ihat we are. If you
wani ta be fair -ta the wamen you should
include the-ir husband.
Hon. Mr. SHARPZ: You cannai include
men under ibis Bill.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: Certainly. You can
make sny ame<xdment ta the Bill. I am
going ta mave an amendment in a few
minutes that will etartle you; but it will

Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTB: At first sight
this amendinent appeale to me because it
affirms the principle that when a man
knows two languages hie is a bettos man
than if hie knew enly one. If a foreigner.
in order to vote, is obliged to learn one of
,the two officiai languages of this country,
hie will then know two languages and will
be a better man. In this way the
amendment appeals to me. I think we

On the other hand, I'ai n ot able to support
the amendint because I, a.nd I think my'
honeurabie friend ito my right (Hon. Mr.
David), have always fought for the principle that the vote should be taken on the
,provincial iists. As f ar as I know, every
province in the Northwest bas its own list,'
and I could net consistently say that those
lists should noV be used. On this ground.
I arn unable to support the amendinent.
There is another point about this amendment; it discriminates against the men. It
is true that this Bili deais with women's
suiffrage, but I think that men could be
included in an amendment. Under the
Naturalization Act foreigners are obliged te
know one of the officiai languages of this
country. For the reasen which I have
stated, I cannot support the amendment.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: It being- ny

should nez realize -the gravity of the situaVion to-day, and I cannot agree with my
honourabie friend froi Portage la Prairie
(Hon. Mr. Watsoni), that those people are
loyal Vo the cause of the Empire. I think

and Austria against the Britishi Empire;
and their friends are living in my county
to-day. Before I started to raise a battalion, rwhich I did in 1914, we had those
men parading up.-and down of the back
streets of Selkirk, performing the goosestep, to the admiration of the people who
did flot realize whiat they iwere doing. Yet
my honourable friend wants to tell me that
those people are loyal.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Do those people
speak EnglishP
Hon. *Mr. BRADBURY.- Yes, a great
many o0f them do. One of the questions
in Western Canada is that very question
of the ischool. Those foreigners have maintained their own teachers and have taught
their language in spite of ail that provincial school inspectors coul do, as my
honourable friend knows. A great many,
of themn speak English, but they cannot
read a word of English. -That is flot the
question, however. The point is that a]]
their syrnpathies and ail their ideals are
agaînst the *British Empire and ail that
we stand for in thia country.
My honourable friend referred to the immigration question. I take a different position aitogether from what hie does on that
matter. If those people wish to corne to
thjs country and participate in 'what we
have to offer, they are weicome; we give
themn our lands and make them settiers;
but 8urely that does not call for giving
them an equal status with us in the management of the affairs of our country. Why
shouid we allow the Gerrrfan or Austrian
or any other foreigner here to vote on the
question of war, for instance whether we
are to supply troops to fight in defence of
the principles for which our men are shedding their blood on the plains o! Flanders?
Yet that is the position in which we are
placing them.
Many of the gentlemen on the other side
of the House did not sympathise with the
War-time Elections Act; but if 'the late
Government hiad gone to the country without that Act, they would have been gulity
of a crime ag-ainst Canada, in placing the
ballot in the hands of thousands of our
enemies and asking them to say w'hether
we should continue in this war and send
troops to the assistance o! our boys at, the
front; but that is what is proposed to be
done in giving those people the franchise.
Hon. M~fr. WATS ON: The honourable
gentleman is perfectly right in saying that

been a change of Government and a change
of policy. My -honourable friend knows
that the Roblin Government had a college
in -Manitoba and paid teachers to teacli
the foreigners ioreign languages.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: I rise to point of
order.
Hlon. Mr. CLORAN: The honourable gentleman bias a right to speak. What ia the
matter with you? 1There is f ree speech here.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: Read the clause
before the chair, if you please, and let us
hear what we are discussing.
Honl. the CHAIRMAN: Shall 'the amendment be adopted?
Hon. Mr. WAT SON: I want to say that
the only language that is taught in the
public schools of Manitoba today is the
English language.
The amendment o4 Hon. Mr. Sharpe was
negatived.
Hon. J. D. TAYLOR: I wish toi cail attention to another anomaly in paragraph c,
something whîch I -arn quite sure was not
intended to be in 'this Bill. We have provided by the War-time Elections Act, which
runs concurrently with this Bill and is to
be read with IL, that a certain class of
British- subjects shaîl not be entitled to
vote, namely, those who have been born
in enemy count-ries and have been naturalîzed. since 1902. We have given to the persons so forbidden 'the righit to vote a
substantial concession in return for that,
namely, exemption from military servicean exemption particuiarly valuable now
when ail the exemptions granted .to tihe
young men o! other classes in Canada are
being witihdrawn, and ail persons physically fit irom 20 to 22 years o! age have to
go to 'the front. Now, by this act we confer
the franchise on a large number, possibly
a large majority, of the wives o! those citizens who themselves are -forbidden the
franchise. We confer the right to vote on
the mothers of t'hose young men wvho are
exempted from military service because we
have taken away the votes lrom their
fathers. I feel quite sure that nothing of
that kind wvas intended, and therefore wish
to offer an amendment to cure what I 4,hink
is an obvious defect. I would therefore
move, seconded by Hon. Mr. Sharpe, as
fo'llowB:
That paragraph c of subseotion 2 of section
1 be amended by adding the foiaowing proviso
before the word "or" In the last une:
'Provided, however, th-at a woma-n who is the
wife of a natura]ized British subject Who waa

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUG{HEED: I arn very

already been said-and I do net propose
taking up any longer tirne-it will ha without adding any qualification other th.an
what is .found within the four corners of the
Bull.
The arnendnen't of Hon. J. D. Taylor was
negatived.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: 1 want te
make a slight criticiarn of paragraph c. If
I did net believe that at a cornparatively
early date, wben tbe War-tima Elections
Act la repealed, the whole question of the
franchise both for mten and wornen ail over
Canada would ha brought up in this House,
I should oppose as s'trongly as possible the

this country a vote witbout an educational

or any other qualification.
now t.o point eut something that we ought
to arnend in paragrapb c. From line 30 to
the end of the paragraph power is given te
the official who prepares the veters' lists
te racaive a certificate signed by a judge
o! - any court of record or of any superior
court," certifying that the fernale applicant
-la ef the full age er twenty-one years, has
resided, in Canada sufficient l.ength of timne,
and la possesaed o! ail requiremnents neceasary
te entitle hier, if uniarried, to becorne naturallzed as a British subject, and that skie has
taken the oath of allegiance.

Thereupon the officiai who prepares the
list ia entiiled te add bier name te it. Under

this pragraph a judge of any court of Nova
Setia, or of New Brunswick, or of Prince
Edward Island, or of Quehec, might give
-the certifloate necassary te add a foreigner
te the list for Saskatchewan, Manitoba, or
Alberta. More than that, thare is ne obligatien on tbe person te attend the court; no
personal application is necessary, as I construe the paragraph; ne notice of the intended application is required, such as there
is under naturalization. I subrnit that hafora that certificate should ha given to any
person, the intending applicant should do
what is required te ha do.ne under naturalization. In that case threa months' notice
îs raquired. I would net ask that long, but
the applicant should ha raquired te give
serne notice posted up in the post office in

and seeks teo vote; and therealter, when she

mpkes hier application, and she should
make it at -least in the province, preferably in the electoral district in which
she reside8;. and she should personaily
appear in court, as she would have to to,
under naturalization. We could have the
most objectionable rasuits from the operation of this paragraph. I arn a lawyer,
and while I have a very hîgh respect for
the bench, Il have flot an unqualified reripect for every occupant of the bench, and
it would ha possible for a judge outsida of
one of those provinces altogether, if hie
were flot ýhe most upright man, if hie were
an old politican, to permit any attorney or
agent-a lawyer or anybody aise-to appear
before him in smre place f ar removed from
where the woman voter should get t*he certificate, and without bier having been seen,
without anybody in that district knowing
she was going to apply, issue bis certîficate
autborizing bier te be enrolled. I do not think
that sueh a power sbould ha entrusted to a
judge at ail, axcept on notice of the intandad application of the woman for such cartificate, and on her actual appearance in
open court. A disbonest partisan judga
might actually bave a person appear before
hlm and pack the lists in certain parts of a
province. I amn sure the Govarnment neyer
contamplated such a stata of things as that.
It could coeur, and the very thought of the
po-_sibility of it occurring suggests to those
of us who know sornathing practically
about the making of a lisi a reason for
providing in some way against -the paragraph geinig through in its present form.
I had prepared an amendrnent, but I do
flot intend to move it in view of the fsot
that a full Franchise Act, daaling with both
men and wornen, will ha eubmitted to this
IHouse at a comparatîvely early date, if
"efre there 'is
not inunediately, yet
another ganeral -elaction. In the meantime,
¶ think it is wreng that this section, giving
unlirnitad power, should ha placad on the
*statute-beok ini its presen-t fexrrn.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: The point which xny
honourable friend raises is providad for in
section 19 of the Naturalization Act.
Paragraph c was agreed te.
On paragraph d:
If. notwithstandIng skie la mnarrled to an allen,

MAY 3, 1918
The amendment wae agreed to, and paragraph d as amended was agreed to.
Hon. J. D. TAYLOR: B-efore we leave
section 1, 1 have an amendment to move as
an addition. We have recently had a new
Naturalization Act in Canada, the N'aturalization Act of 1914, whieh has corne juilly
into force ziincs the Ist of January of this
-year. Under that tAct, ever>' persan having
'had previous limited naturalization is
privileged to appi>', without an>' tedious or
expensive prooedure, to have hie naturalization changed to the complete British
naturalization which we now give. By that
Act we confered neyerai privileges upan
citizene by virtue of their naturalization.
Parsons who desire to enjoy those privileges
should be intereeted enough to tgke naturalization under the new Act. One effeet of
that naituralization would be ta increase
itheir responsibilities as citizens, because we
exempt f rom military service persons
from enemy countries naturalized under -the old Act, on
the grouind
that that naturalization doe not entirel>'
wean them from their country of origin, but
leaves them still liable to military service
there and to be treated as traitors il the>'
take part in, the armed forces of the British
Empire. For this and other reasons, which
at this late hoin, 1 will tiot enter upon, I
wish to bring the suM~ect formal>' before
the House b>' moving that the following be
added. to section il, a subsectionS:
For the purposes of thub Act "naturaized"
and «'naturalization' shail be deemed to mean
xmtura-Uzed and naturalizatlon under the Naturalization &et, 1914.
Haon. Mr. DANDURAND: Do I understand that this would eliminate ail the
electors or citizens qualified under the old
legisiation?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGH:EED: It would
have that effect. I hope my hanourable
friend <Hon. J. *D. Taylor) will not -press
the amendment.
Hon. J. D. TAYLOR: Honaurable gentlemen, really I do not think a matter like
-this should b. disposed o! so lightly. We
have before the Senate a Bill as to which
we are virtually told that we must not
amend it in any particular as a resuit of
-our discussion or criticism. I regard this
as a matter of ver>' great importance, and,
wiith ail deference, I dissent f rom the view
just etated b>' the honourable leader (Hon.
*Sir James Laugheed), that the amendment
wou.ld have the effect o! cancelling al
previous naturalization. It is quite clear
ta me dýhat it does nothing of he kind. It
inter! eres not at sdi with the present natura-

42(

lization, but saYs: "If you wanr. fresh
privileges in Canada as naturalized subjects, You must, in order cte obtain any
further privileges, bring yourself under the
Naturalization Act o! the present." It does
flot interfere ait ail witih the privileges now
enjoyed b>' an>' persan under the old
Naturalùàztion Act.
The amendmnent of Hon. Mr. Taylor was
negatived.
Section 1, as amended, was agreed to.
Sections 2 and 3 were agreed to.

Hon. Mr. CLORAN: I have already given
notice of -an amendment which I proposed
ta move a en addition to this Bill, but 1
do not want ta detain the Oommittee, .and
the amendment can b. moved just as wel

Honourable gentlemen will understand
that this amendment jei for the purpose of
giving the electors in each of the provinces
the right el determining whether they want
to have the privil-ege of the application of
thi8 Bill. My honourable friend the member f rom Halifax (Hon. Mr. Power) moved
an amendment on the second reading along
the line of enunciating that the policy te
be adopted in this BilI should be that of
Ieaving it entirely to the provinces te
determine what should ho done. This Bill
of course takes the question out of the hands
of the provinces and brings the women's
franchise under the War-time Eilections
Act of last session. This amendment which
I arn now proposing does net in any way
interfere with the War-time Elections Act,
but its effect ie that in the case of a
Dominion Election this Act shail not be in
force in any province iwhich has not decided
whether or not the women in that province
shaltl vote at a provincial election. The
policy of leaving the question of who shahl
vote at an election te be decided by the
province rather than by the Dominion as
a whohe ie, I think, a good one, and it je
witlh the object of placing this question
before the House and giving- the House an
oportunity of saying whether they agree
with that policy or not that I beg now to
move this amendment.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 1 would

amendment would introduce inte this Bill

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.

That the said Bill be now read a third
time, but thit It be amended by striking out
the proviso In paragraph c of the first subclause in the first clause.

If honourable gentlemen look at the Bill,
they will see that paragraph c of the first
clause reads as follows:

the
qualifcations
which
wouhd
entitIc a ma.le person to vote at a Dominion
Ehection in the province in whtch said f emahe

person seeks to vote.
I think ail honourable gentlemen have
feIt, and people outside also have f elt, that
if there were to be woman suffrage the
women should enjoy the franchise on the
same terms as men, andl the portion of this
paragraph which -1IhavereaI carrnes out that
intention. None of the women would have
been disappointed if it had stoppied there;
but the proviso je " that a mnarried woman
orr an unefnarried daughter -living with hex
father or xnother shahl be dee.med to have
any necessary qualification as to property
or income if the husband or either of the
parents ie so qualifled."- Under that provife you let in -a large nurnibex of young
ladies particularhy who are riet iinany sense
qualified. I think that while every one of
us believes in giving wornan all ber righits,
rights in the matter of franchise should not
exceed the rights which men have; and I
do not myself think that the ladies who
have been looking for the. right te vote
ever expected that they were going te be
pla.ced in a more favourable position thn
the men.
There is juet this one other con.sideration,
to which I desire te cail the attention of
thie honourable leader of the Government.

The population cf Germany, icreasing at

The. population increased in spite cf death

blosses ta the extent of 134,000 per year.
What does that niean? Germans emigrated
te the 'United States, te England, ta Canada
and ta other countries ta the extent of 134,000 per year freni 1881 ta 1890; f rom 1891 ta
1910 that figure wint down ta 52,000 yearly;
and in 1912, i preparation for this war, the
Kaiser -kept bis population at home and
the emigratian was only 12,000. In spite
cf that, emigration of 134,000 per year for
twenty years, the. German population increased from 35,000,000 ta 67,000,000, as admnitted by the Government, 'but to 87,000,000

while our Parliament, our newspapers, our

imen tp fill the gaps in the trenchea, we
neglect to, cali for -more babies ta fill their

about pro tecting industries, and a0 on; but
the bottom industry for the .afety cf al

SECOND READING POSTPONED.

Hon. GEORGE H. BRADBURY moved
the second reading of Bill J, an Act to
amend the Dominion Elections Act.
*He said: The purpose of this Bill Is to
continue the disfranchisement o! alien enemies after the War-timre Elections Act
ceases to operate. Thia may 4seemn drasrtic
legisiation, -andi by some may Lbe considered
unjustifiable; but js it so in face of the

Few, if any, who have -the 'best vishes o!
this country at heart, will have the temer*ity to say that this Bill is not justifiable.
We rnay Lbe asked whether the War-time
-Elections Act was justifiable; but I thin<

435

there are very few men in this House or out
lof it who would ýhave the temerity to
say it was not; and if that be so, I
mnainitain that, owing to conditions prevailing especially in the weatern, part of
t.his country, ail those qoreigners who have
been naturalized and have 'become votera are
the aame menace to-.the Lest. interestr of
this -country as they were at -the time
of the passing of the War-time Elections
Act. ql do flot intend -to labour this question, as Il made a very clear etaternent of
my position yesterday, and II would have
felt juatified then in moving my amendment to the -Woen's Electoral Franchise
Bill, which would place foreigu men and
women on the same footing regarding the
franchise ofthis country, had it not been
that ibis present Bdif was on the Order
Paper.
The present Bill is an ameudment to the
Dominion Elections Act, section 67, which
refers to disqualification of voters. Paragraph d o! that section says:
Any person who, at the time of an election,
la a prtsoner inu a l or a prisoner undergoing Punlshment for a criminal offence, or la
a patient in a lunatie asylum. or ls malntalned
lu whoi. or in part as an lumnate receling
charitable support. etc.

Those people are ail disfranchised, and
this amendfrnet of mine la proposed to be
added 'to that, section:
Persona who are or at any time have been
subJects of any forelgu nation, which was not

one of the allies of Ris Majesty during the
preseut war and whlch does not continue to be
an ally of His Msjesty to the end of said. war:
Provided that the provisions 0f this paragraph
shai not apply or extend to any persan who
is a British subject and has been a resident of
Canada since he was twelve years of age, or to
any persan who has served in the Canadi an

0f Hie Majesty's allies In the present war, and
has been honourabiy discharged therefrom, or.
If an officer, has been Permnitted to resign or
without fauit on lits part has had his services

-Honourable gentlemen will see at a
glance what is intended by -this Bill. The
object is to make it impossible for foreigners coming from alien countries that'are not
allies of His Majesty during the preeent
war to vote iu thîs country unless they have
lived in the country since they were twelve
years o! age.

SECOND READINGS--THE GEORGIAN BAY
CANAL COMPANY BILL.

Elon. lMT. BEL(X>URT xnoved the second
reading of Bill 24, an Act respecting the
Montreal, Ottawa and Georgian Bay Canal
Company.
Hon. Mr. POWER: Explain,.
Hon. Mr. -BELCOURT: The Bill merely
provides for extension of time for the
beginning and completion of construction.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Is it a new project?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No, it is rather
an old one.
Hon. Mr. RICHARDSON- If thiere is any
one subject that, we have discussed for
years, it is the proposal to build a canal
from the Georgian bay to Montreal. There
is only one feature that recommends this
project to nie, and that is the short disHon. ÙMr. BRADBURY.

tance; but if At is impracticable as a commercial undertaking it is absolutely unwise. This canal is s-upposed to be 440
miles in length. The height to be reached
is 649 feet. The drop from the height of
land to the Georgian bay is 98 feet. The
depth of this canal ie proposed to he 22
feet, so es to accommodate upper lake
steamers of the 'largest size. In this canal
it is proposed that there should be 300-foot
chainnels on the surface, with a 200-foot
width at the bottom, and with 22 feet draft,
so as to accommodate those large steamers.
There are 116 curves in the canal of a mile
or less radius, anid 27 or 29 curves of half a
mile or less radius. There are to be 27
looka. A question that has always been
before the engineers is that of water. In
their last report te the Governmenit the
engineers gave their opinion that several
years should elapse before anything ws
done, for after a careful survey of the
sources which are to feed the head-waters
of this canal, they thought there was not
sufficient water at the head to provide the
depth required by a boat in order to navigate the canal oeafely. They recommended,
also, the conotruction of a number of
dams. and a careful conservation of the
tim'ber limits in that northern country, so
as to keep the water from evaporating,
otherwise it would do so, for when the
woodsf and forests are cut out and the
country is drained for agricultural purpOses, the water flows off very rapidly, and
in summer morâthe there is very littie or
none te be had.. Besides, the Ottawa river
rises and faîls as much as 25 feet in a
year, making it a most difficuit navigation
problem.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: The Ottawa river?
Hon. Mr. RICHARDSON: You will find
in the records that in 1876 the Ottawa river
rose and feil 25 feet.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: I remember that.
How ofteni since, that?
Hon. Mr. RIOHÂARDSON: Now, regard ing
the steamers. It is. proposed to bring down
that canal a steamer of 22-foot draft. Well,
that is ahead of anything we have at the
present time. A eteamer of 18 or 19 feet
draft cen pass 1hrough the existing locks,
and it ie supposed to carry anywhere from
10,000 to 14,000 tens. I know fTom experience thet it is almost impossible for a
steamer drawing 20 feet to navigate a short
curve of hall a mile without striking the
benks. There is. something in the modern
phrase, thet the steamer "1snwlls -the
bottom." When she, smells -the bottom

MAY 3, 1918
she is uncontrollable as far as steering ls
concerned. That has happened over and
over again. Even if it were possible for
sucli a steamer to navigate those waters to
Montreal, I question very much whether
any insurance could be placed either on the
steamer or the cargo.
F.urtherrnore, 1bhese canais comprise a
aystern of waterways, deepened- rivers, lakes
dam-med, up, and looka ta overcome the
rapida. The lock is generally eut i.nto the
bank of the etream, and the report of the
engmneers recommends the construction of
long piers of 2,000 feet to allow a steamer
to enter the locke. Now, when the first
«ste of a look is closed, it sce as a dam
againat the strearn, and the water in. that
distance of 2,000 lest is supposed to be
comparatively dead, so -as toa show the
steamer te corne in elowly. But the zte-amer
cornes in et an angle, 1because, the lock is
eut ont of tdie-side oi tlhe bank; Her stera
stands out in the current, which is very
atrong there ïbecause there ie a rapid, and
lier bow approaches the wing-walI ci the
pier. -and what happens? Unless she is
controlled by two or three tuge, hier stern
la carried down stream, -because her headway
in etopped. You cannot go in wifli a
steamer of 10,000 or 14,000 tons, .at any
ffead greater tihan ibarely rnoving, bevause
lier headway is stopped, lier atern is carried
down strearn, and what follows? Her -bow
etrikes against the wing-wall and. ls
damnaged. This happens over and over again
on the St. 'Lawrence with vessels ci 2,200
and 2,300 tons. It happens ini the Welland
canal as well, though that canal ie hardly
like the Georgian bay, because it is fed
by one feeder coming in frorn tihe Grand
-river, and the firet streteli of the Welland
canal is -a level streteli tram Lake Erie ta
Thorold.
Again, it is said that this canal would
give a chance for a steamer to go down te
Montreal and on ta Europe. But a lake
vassel is not constructed for ocean. navigation, as ehe is fiat on the bottom, broad and
sliallow, lias only one deck, and ha@ rnany
hatches in order that loading and unIoading
cani <be done quickly. She lias no bulwarks,
on-ly an open rail; everything on the boat
is sacrjficed ta draft. An ocean vessel is
juat the opposite; hier hatches, and bulwarks
are higb and she is narrow and deep, se
that &lhe can stand the 9ea and work in it
'witjhout st.rain.
A lake vessel such I have described could
not get first-class insurance te Europe
without paying very heavily for it. Even
supposing she could make a'trip ta Europc,
wb.ile it, dookLs well on paper to Joad grain

437

am Fort William and deliver it at LiverpoDI,
it is not a feasible proposition, and never
will be madle to pay. Sucli a steamer wil
neyer compete successfully against ocean
steamers, for two reasons: oe ia that tlie
cost of crews, engineers and captains on
the lakes does net correspond ini the
slightest degree with the cost of operating
on the ocean in ordinary trnes, for we pay
double as mucli on the lakes for tliose
items as ocean navigation costs. The other
reason is that tlie océan vessel to-day is
flot 10,000 tons, but 20,000, 30,000 or 34,000
tons, as we heard the other day wlien one
was sunk on its way to England. How
could a vessel of 10,000 or 14,000 tons compete against one of 20,000 or 30,000 tons
carrying a crew that coste only half as mucli
money. and with insurance that is only a
fraction of what our insurance would be?
Therefere 1 contend that it is not possible
to load a steamer at Fort William and
deliver the cargo at Liverpool in cempetition with tramp steamers and ocean tonnage
ini Montréal.
'Hon. Mr. WATSBON:' What dos it cost
te tranafer the cargo from, the lake boat to
the ocean-going steamer?
'Hon. Mx.- RICHARDSON:

Hon. -Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: This has
been found very unsa'tisfactory. It is propo-sed t.hat the duties incident to the office
of inspecter should be lixnited 'to inspection,
and that the ad.ministration should be supervised by a superintendent.

Hon Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.

Justice. Will that condition be continued&
T thought it was a very unreasona!býc attitude.
Hon. Sir JAMrZ- LOUGHEED: I really
cannot say. I arn entirely unaware of the
facts; but the duties of the grand jury, 1
iNcuid assume, 'would be confined to provincial institutions, the grand jury beinq
a -provincial body.

Hon Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I know
of ne reason >why the courtesy should flot
be extended te them of allowing thema te
visit a federal institution if they s0 desire,
provided the visit is not' an assertion cf
their authority to do so.
Hon. Mr. CLOIRAN: In regard to, that
point, 1 have had some experience in crinimnal matters, and I think it would be a
safeguard, even for the Federal Government te give the grand, juries the right-not
tne privilege, but the right-to visit these
institutions. They will net subvert anything. They will make a report, either te
the Federal Governmnt or the provincial
government. In Great Britain, and especially in the United States, the grand jury
is recogniied as a judicial body. Here ail
great criminal cases corne under the supervision and inspection cf the grand jury.
I do net think the Governmenit would suifer
anything by having the grand jury given
the right te miake a visit and report thereon.
I think it would be a service to the
Government. Then they would. have a free
and independent opinion. If that is net
provided for in the Bull, probahly the minister weuld consider it. 0f course, it is a
moatter of administration, I will admit. I
think it would b. very unwise on the part
cf any minister of justice te refuse te a
grand- jury the right te visit any public
institution cf that kind, and 1 think the
Federal Government weuld 'be well advised
net te allow gthrat right te be refused.
Hen. Mr. McMEATNS: In Manitoba it

Hon. Mir. POWERR: One point in the
Bill do>ea net seexn to, correspond or barmonize with the statement made by the
honourable leader of the House. As I understand, the duties cf the 'inspecters are te

salaries. At the present -time there are
only two inspecters. The Bill provides
for three. The -wo'k is reduccd, but the
nusnber cf men who are to, dû the woric

O<F OEilR~Ca~DIEADING

MOVID--BIHL WI1IRÂWAN.
Hon. GEORGE H. BRADBURY moved
,the second reading o! Bill J, an Act to
amend the Dominion Elections Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, as I
stated at the last saitting of the Houae, this
Bull purposee continuing a disqualification
containe-d in section 67 o! the Dominion
Elections Act. So that the House may be
properly informed as to the intention o!
this amendmient, I will read section 67 and
the amendment. Section 67 is as follows:

The foIlowing persons shali be disquaiied
and Incompetent ta vote at any election:
(a) The judges of every court whose appointment reste with the Governor in Cauncil;
(b) Persons disfranchisied for- corrupt practices under i.his Act;
(c) Persoa disfranchised under the Disfranchising Act;
(d) Any person who, at the tirne or an electian, le a prisaner In a jail or prison, undergoing
punishinent for a criminal offence, or la a
patient In a lunatic asyium, or is maintained in
whole or In part as an inrnate receiving charitable support or care in a municipal poorhouse
or bouse of industry, or is an inmate receiving
charitable support in any institution receiving
aid from the Government of the province under
any statute in that behalf;

The amendmen.t 1 propose by this Bill
witl add to these disqualifications:
1. Subsectian one of section sixty-seven of the
Dominion Elections, Act, chapter six of the

Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906. is amended
by adding thereto the following paragraph:
(e) Persons who are or at any time have
been subjects of any foreign nation, which was

MAY 6, 1918
flot one of the allies af Hia Majesty during the
present war and which does flot continue ta be
an aJ.ly af Hia Majesty ta the end of snid war:
-Provided
that thé provisions of this paragraph
saal1 flot aWply or extend te any pereon Who Je a
British subject and has been e, resident af
Canada since he was twelve years af age, or ta
any persan Who has served ln the Canadian
Ebrpeditionary Forces, or in the farces af, any
of Bts Majesty's allies. ln the present war, and
has been honaurably discharged theretrom, or.
If an officer, has been perxnitted ta resign or
wlthout fault an bis îàrt han bail hie services
dispensait with.
2. This Act shall came lnto operation as soon
as The War-Time Electians Act chapter thirtynine of the statutes of 1917, cessez ta be ln
operation.

Tbfs will no doubt strike sme honourabler gentlemen as being drastie legisiation.
Borne may feel that it la unjuatifiable. I
admit frankly that the legimiation js drastic;
but I contend that, in the peculiar circumstances ini which we find ourselves to-day,
there is no legisiation too drastic to save
Canada frorn the foreign menace wbich exisa in the Country. As a Canadian having
the best interests of my country at heazt, I
arn atisfied in m2y own mind that the
ameudment in entirely justifiable.
The amenaiment 1. propose by 'thia Bill
hionourable gentiemén ought ta know -just
how formidable *this menace fa in Canada
at the present time. The alien vote is especially large in the three wemtern provinces, -not to may anything of the rest of
Canada. In every City in Canada the alien
vote is very large, and is a menace* owing
to he fact that these foreigners are not
competent to discharge properly the grave
duties that rest upon them in the use of
the franchise. In the tb.ree -western provinces the allen vote is a senfous mienace to the Pest interests of Canada.
When 1 tell thi s honourable House that
from 30 to 40 per cent of the total -votera of
the three western provinces are ahiana, honourable gentlemen wilI Ïhave some conception of how formidable their vote really im.
But that is not the worst of it. If a vote
were taken on the present lists. that would
be about the percentage; but 'when we
realize that tans cf thousands of our young
men, the flower of our young manhood,
have lef t the western provinces to cross
the seas to flht for the principles and ideals
which. we entertain, and when we realize
-thattheWomen's Franchise Act that went
through this Hause a day or two ago pur.
poses enfranchising thousands of 'these alienboru women, and when the War-time Elections Act ceased to be aperative, fhe foreign
vote would.formi a very m'uch larger percentage and be a much greater menace to the

441

best interests of the country. Canada has
nearly 400,000 ofher young men seros the
,aeus contending for princ 1 ples and ideals
that axe dear te every Citizen of every dèmecratic country- These yoixng men are Contending against the same olass of people
that enjoiy in Canada to-day equal righte
and equal. pravileges with British .subjects
who have been bro'ught up and edrucated
along de.mocratic lines, and who understand democratic gevernment, wbich
these aliens, unfortunately, do net. The
people that I speak -of, coming from Couintries under autocratic rule, horst and raised
in an atmosphere that has produced the
modern Hun, tbat ha. produced the worst
clams o! humanity that the world ha. ever
seen, know absolutely mothing asbout the
high ideala o! democracy. One cannoît expeot viery much from thtsclase of people,
and I contend that the giving of the franchise to them is a crime against the best
interesta of thim country. Remember, nfnety
per cent of these people-who have en.joyed
-thehoapitahity o! Canada came to this coantry in abject poverty-e-ame as serfs, or litIle
better than serfs, without aniy traindng,
without auy ides of what ought to b. expected irom. citimens in a great democracy,
11k. the one they -were eomiug to. When
they came to our western provinces they
were treated- one hundred per cent better
than oui own British mettiers. When they
were in want, when hunger assailed them,
the Government o! Canada carne to their
rescue, and sent huudreds o! cars of bacon,
sugar, snd flour to them, wbile the Can.adian settler, who waa living perhas in
the same, township, and Who, perbaps, was
just as hungry as the other fellow, could
not mecure one pound of thia flour or bacon.
These people were ta-ken good care of; they
were treated better than any British settier
in this counitry. How have tihey repaid that
treatment? Hundreds cf those men who
had. become citizens of tbis country, and
ta.ken the oath o! allegiance found their
way back te their own lande and are to-day,
if .they are living, fighting in the ranka of
the armies againet ideals held by Britishi
subjects here and against hundreda of thousands of young mren that we have sent from
Canada .4o uphold tihose idisals- and principlee. I amn s.atinfied, tihat tihe public d'o. not
understand tbhe gravity of this question, or
the danger that threatens tbis country froni
this foreigu menace. If the counitry were
properly seized of the fact, I arn ssaisfled
that there would be such a howl from one
end o! this Dominion to the other as 'would

SENATE
force any Governmeît to corne to, the relijef
of the British Canadian, and make it irapossible for these aliens to enjoy the same
liberties, the same privileg-es and the same
citizenship as British subjects enjoy in this
coun.try at the present time.
A few months, ago the late Government,
before appealing to the country, realizing
the formidable menace that these people presented, brought into force the War-t.ime
Elections Act. At that time there were public men, in this House and in. the other
Hause, who did flot agree -with tbe Government, as. they felt tha-t it was drstic
and unjustifia-ble legisiation; but, in view
of what has taken place during the last six
or eight months, I do flot believe there is
any public maxn in t.his country havding the
best interests of Canada at heart who would
challenge the wisdom of that Act to-day.
Everyone who has ipaid any attention ta
'wbat has taken place during the election
and since realizes that if the aliens had
been allowed ta vote as ta whether Canada
should carry on ithis war and do its ful
share in fighting for the liberties of the
world by sending more men ta reinforce our
boys 'whom we had already sent across the
-water, their answer would have been an
emphet.c no. Can any one woaider that
that- would ibe their answer?
It is
almost asking too much of these people ta
be any other Vhan they are. Blood is
thicker than water. I do flot doubt that,
if any honourable gentleman in this House
had made bis home in Austria or Germany
and was living there when war was declared, aIl his sympathies would have been
with the British Empiire. It could noV be
otherwise; it is flot reasonable ta expect
it. It is the same with those people who
are in this country to-day. Their sympathies
are entirely with Germany and Austria and
their allies.
Therefore I contendthat these people are
rot entitled ta full citizemship in a country
like Canada. We have always been taught
ta believe that the franchise is a sacred
trust, the most sacred thing that we as
British subjects enjoy. It is sometimes
abused, but it ifs s.acred ta those who look
at this question properly. If we are ta
make the best of things in Canada, if we
are ta develop what we hope and expect will
be developed an this northern part of this
great continent-one of the greatest countries in the world-now is the time Io pro-.
teet the franchise, protect the man who
helps ta make the laws, the man who niakes
or unmakes the Government of the day.
Hon. Mr. BRADYBURY.

The fact is, honourable gentlemen-and I
arn apeaking advisedly-we have too many
af this class of people in-Canada to-day.
We have more of these people in Canada
týhan we have been able ta absorb. I knaw
a great many gentlemen, especially from
the West, who raise the cry for more
settlers, ta settie this great .country of ours.
That lias been the cry for years. One
Govemment after another bas ispent millions or money for the purpose of securfnig
settlers. I want ta say ta this honourable
House, as one who has lived in the West
during the last thirty-five years. and who
bas some right ta know, that the cîsass of
settlers that we secured when we brouglit
aliens from Sauthern Europe was flot the
best class of settlers that we could have
iniduoed ta came ta Canada. I contend that
one British or one American settier is worth
a hundred of these men ae f ar as the best
interests of Canada are concerned. These
foreigners are noV producers ta any great
extent. They have amaîl farms, especially
in Northern Manitoaba. They produce only
enough ta keep them living. They have
settled on lands, and they devote most of
the 'time ta working around at 'different
places in the' country. 15ince this war
began, and since aur own young men went
away ini tens of thousands 'ta fight the
battie cf freedom and liberty, and against
ideals held by these people, theee very
aliens have.taken advantage cf the absence
of aur young men ta make it almost impassible for farmers to cultivate and save
their erops on account of the exorbitant
prioes which they demand for their labour.
This Parli ment and the people of this
country owe no debt of sympathy ta these
people. The argument that we must have
more settiers. regardless of their qualific-ations, is ta niy mind a very dangerous one.
IV has led Canada inta what I consider a
serieus fault in bringing sa many of these
people ta this country. It musit alwayis be
remembered, when we are talking of
securing settlers for thé development of
this great country of ours, that we
have 'within aur own boundaries native
Canadiaus asnd British Canadianýs, the best
people in the world; and, we ought ta have
saine co(neideration for them and noV bring
in people -whe have had absolut-ely ne training ta qualify them. for full oitizenship in
a demucratio -country like this. These foreignees have -been trained arnd 1brought up
in an atinospliere which a;b6alutely disqualifies thein. for citizenship in this cauntry,
and the albility Vo exereise it ta the advan-

.MAY 6, 1918
tage of this country. It has been pointed
out before «that the greatness of a nation,
the greatn.ess of Canada, does not depend
on its weaitb or the nurnier of people within its bordera; it dependis upon the character
of the people. The character of our new
eettlers and the viirility of the people are
the things that g,6 to make a great and lasting -nation.
I irnow I ehall be toid, I have already
been told privately, th.at it was just such
action. a& this that ca'used the Boer War,
because the Boers refusied to. give the. franchise to Britishers 'who lied eettbed in the
Trausvaal. Surely, honourahie gentlemen,
there is no anaiogy between the two cases.
Englishmen had gone to the Transvaal and
had expended hundireds of imillions of dollars in deveiopping the mines of that
country. They carried with them the training and the educatian of demooracy, and
when they asked for representatian, eurely
it was a very different thing from asking
representation lor =en who have corne to
this country not oniy entireiy ignorant of
everything that a citizen of this country
ahould know, but entirely uney-mpathetic
towa-rde our best interests. 'Ninety per cent
o! these men in tuhs country are flot o.nly
*aliene, 'but allen enemiee. They are men
wi» hawi no sym-pathy with us. They are
men wbo, were it mot for fear, -wauld have
ca-used us far -more troublie than they have.
Theusauds of these men have 'been interned;
thousande- more would. have Ibeen in-terned
if it had not been for the. fear of the iaw. 1
a~m atating thà.s not beeause I want to be

offensive or hard upon these people, but
becauee I Tealize that these people, trained

as they have been, o'rnng

from.

the Aus-

trian or the Germau swehools-the Bulgars
and Russians are just as bad-have no sympatb.y 'with and cannot understand Canadi4an. aime and ideals.
Norw, I arn mot going to labour t.his question, honourajhle gentlemen. The arnendment which I propose is designoed to. prevent
ail this ciass o! people voting i-n Canad-a, and
is designed to becoxne operative imniediately after the War-tirne Elections Act ceases
ta be operative. I. hardiy expec.t it will
be adopted, becauee I realize that no great
reform of this kind is made in a day; but
1 -believe there wiii be frorn one end of
this country to the other before very long
an agitation that will force the hand o!
the Goverrnnent on this very issue.
The Bill would disquaiify ail those aliens
except such as have corne ta thîs country
before they were tweive years o! age. My
-experienc-e frorn living- arnong these people

1-

143

in the West has been that the aider men,
the mren who have corne to this country
after they were twenty years of age, bring
with them ail the prejudices inherited ini
their own country. The young- people, those
who have corne to this country as children'
and have grown up amongst us, have to a
great ertent become fairiy good citizens.
They have been educated in the achools-sometimes. unfortunateiy, in a foreign
school, but in mixing with Canadians they
have become fairiy intelligent, and they
are, I believe, entitied to citizenship. -But
the older people, I contend, are not entitled
to share in the sarne full citizeushiin as persons coming to Canada frorn other British
countries or frorn any other country o! a
democratic nat...
As I said a moment ago. 1 have no intention of iabouring this question. I arn going
ta leave the.Bill with the Houa., and I hope
that it wiil receive same consideration. If
it does not receive consideration frorn this
honourable House it will receive consideration ontside. -T-he people of Canada expect
sorne legialation o! this kind. If bonaurable
gentlemen consider this Bill too drastic or
too far-reaching, it can be am-ended. I do
nat dlaim perfection for the Bill. It expresses prettr-ceariy my opinion as to the.
condition of affaire in Canada to-day with
respect ta this alien question, which is a
serious one.
There are absoiuteiy no politica in this
proposai; I would like honourable gentlemen to be thoroughly imbued with that
idea. This is a tirne to make reforma of this
kind, when we h-ave a Union Gnvernnient.
and 'bath politicai parties w 'ouid take re

hLave just been made .by the honourable

He started by aaying that these foreigners-were a menace to Canada. Those people
were invited to th!s country. They were

they carne here. They have been industrious people. The honourable gentleman
does flot deny that; he canmot deny it; and
I venture 'to say that the speech he has

here to-ay is exactly opposite
to- the épeeches he delivered when he was«
trying to secure the votes -of those people
in his conslituency of Selkirk. For there
were hundreds--I think 1 amn àafe in sayixig thousandsa-of those people in his con-

we have to admit one thing: those foreigners are somewhat like the French of
Quebec in that they are very prolîfic and
have large familleIs, and their children wil
be able te outvote the parents every tirne;
so 1 think the situation, £0 f ar as Canada
is concerned, is perfectly safe in tihe hands
of the younger generation and of the
British-born and Canadians.
1 deaire to submit only these few rernarks

¶Ion. L. G. DE VEBER: Honourable gentlemen, coming from Alberta, I vish to say
a few word-s ini reply to the honourable
gontleman from Selkirk <Hon. Mr. Bradbury), who would deny the franchise
Vo naturalized citizens of foreign bixth
in t.his counîtry. His speech put me in mind
of a speech that 1 heard a good many years
ago at a meeting of the joint boards cid trade
at Regina. A gentleman said that in his
opinion we should allow no foreigners in
Canada; that the immigrants should ail be
Englishmen; t'hait every man coming intlo
Canada should have a certain amount of
rnoney in his pocket and shiould be required
to pasis an examination as ta his educational abilities beifore being admitted. He
talked of decadent races, mongrel races, the
Latin races, and made a long, very interesting and somewhat amusing speech. The first
ansiwer to him was made by an old friend
of mine, who used to be 'in the Northwest
Mounted Police. He said that il he were
not an Englishman he would hardly venture
ta say what he was going to say. He asked:
"0Qf ail the mongrel naitions ini the world,
is there a greater mongrel1 nation than the
English?" And he mentioned the varriaus
sources, from which the English came: the
Picts and Scots, the Normans, the Danes,
the Norwegians, and the Vikings. "But,"
he said, «'ithe mixture makes a pretty good
man, and I think. the Englishirnan of to-day
stands very fav&urably in comparison with
the men, of any other nation."
The next speaker said: -"The gentleman
seems to think that no person should be ailIowed in Canada unless he has a certain
amount cd money in his. pocket. 1 ianded
in Montreal with an English shilling in my
pocket, and I will be't $5,000, whieh can be
given Vo chai-ity if I wâin, that I cari buy
the hoinourable gentleman and all his
family, lock, sitiock and barrel."
1 got up sim'ply Vo make the observation
that I Vhought that ariy man wîth a pair

445

of hands and willing Vo use themn would be
no detriment ta any country. I said:
"Those men are tlhe class oif mnen we do
want. We must have labour to build our
railways, and do our work. But," I said,
"wNhat we do not want in this country are
gentlemen who, like the gentleman who
made the speech. coime to Canada ta live
by theiir wits; we cari breed ail of those
that we want at home."
I have been in probably closer touch with
the foreigners in Alberyta than any other
man 'here. I live in a min.ing town, Lethbridge. Nearly ail our miners, with the exception ci a few Nova Scotians and Englieh,
are foreigners. We h-ave ail kinds: Galiciana, Douk-hobors, Ruthenians, Bukowinians, Italians, Greeks-men -from almoet
every country in Europe.
Hon. Mr. POWER: Not many Germans.
Hon. Mr. DE VEBER: Net many Germans--no. I was not their regular physician. Dr. Mewburn and 1 had been the
on.Iy two physicians there for some years;
and, as he was ili now and then, I had
isometimes ehl the foreignere on my hands.
J have therefore been continually in their
houses. I arn speakiing altogeîther of the
foreigners in Alberta; I know nothing of
those in Manitoba; and if the statements of
my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Bradbury)
are true, Manitoba must have been very
unfortunate in the foreigners picked out to
go there. These people corne to Canada
with littie or no money. They take up a
!quarter-secte'ion of ]and.
I have been in
Alberta ever since 1882; so I should have
some experience in the country. The first
thing the foreigners in Alberta do is to
build a cabin out of wattles and mud. Wa*tVies are the littie trees that they cut down.
They mix the twigs with-> mud and build
themselves -%hat they caîl bouses. If there
are children in the family t.he girls go out
to service. In the winter the man comes
Vo Let'hbridge and works in the mines. He
saves every cent that he makes toe spend it
on the farxn. If the girls make any money
that money also goes on the farm. They
buy a cow, then another cow, then a horse,
and gradually work up until they become
fairly comfortable. I have known them Vo
go so far as ta nake bricks by hand ta build
bouses for the w'hites;- who were too lazy
Vo do it Vhemselves. The bouse they would
bud would -not be very artistic, but iA
would be comfortable and warm. The consequence of the indu stry of these people is
that they can go to almost any store and

get what credit they want, for they psy
their bis; whereas, I arn êorry to say, a
good rnany of the whites in Alberta do not
psy their Bills. But the foreigners do flot
ask for much credit; t.hey corne with their
cash and ask for discount for cash.
Now, one of the chief arguments made by
the honourable gentleman is that they
should not be ellowed the franchise because they corne frorn autocratie countries.
In the narne of Heaven, why did they leave
their country? They left. for freedorn. They
have corne to Canada to be free from autocratic governrnent and to be able to do as
they liked. I have talked with thern tirne
and time again. You could not get any of
those men te go back to the count-ry fromn
which tbey carne; they are opposed in. every
possible way to the governiment of their
coun.try of crngin.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: Will the honourable gentleman excuse me a moment? I
did flot say that people sbouId not be alIowed to corne -te thia couniry because their

was that they should nlot have the franchise

that tihey are men who have been s.ubsidized

of'the Revised Statutes. Section à defines
each peniâtentiary in the Dominion; there
ie one at Kingston, one at St. Vincent de
Paul, one at Dorchester, one in Manitoba,
one in Britishi Columbia, çand one in Alberta.
Are we repeaiing section 5, and deflning
penitentiaries generally?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No. Section 5 is not in any way affected by this
îmeasure. It ie on]y paragraph b -of subsection 1 of section 2 of the Penitentiary
Act that we repeal. That je done under
saect ion 1 of the Bill. When we corne tO
section 3 of the Bill, we propose repealing
sections 14 to 23, both inclusive.
Hon. Mr. TESSIER: There will lie three
inspectors?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Provision
je made for the appointment of three inspectors; but, fromn what I can .learni from
the departinen-t, it je noît the intention to
make a third appointment.
Section 2 was agreed to.
On section 3, new section 14-superintendent:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I notice that it is
provided that:
The Inspectors shall be classified as oflicers
of the Department of Justice In Subdivision B
of the First Division of the Civil Service Act.
But the new section 14 does not say what
cie se the superintendent shafl lie placed in.
If it is necessary to provide for the inspectors in that way, should it flot be done in
the case of the superintendent?
Hon. *Sir .JAMES LOUGHEED:
The
reason je that the present inspectors have
already been classified. The intention of
-the department i6 to reduce the importance
o! the office of inspector, and this Bill also
reduces the salary associated with that
office. The superintendent will be charged
wi.th more imiportant duties than the inspectors. At the -present time the inspectors are charged nût only with inspection,
but with administrative duties. Hereafter
the superintendent will administer and the
inspectors will only inspect.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOGK: According to instruction.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I was flot here
when the Bill was read the second time.
Why is the administration taken from the
two inspectors?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHED: The dual
responsibility of the inspectors has proved

447

very unsatisfactory in the proper administration o! penitentiaries generally, as would
naturally be the case. It seeme to me
rather inconsistent that an inspector should
be an administrator. If hie je charged with
the responsibility o! administering, who je
to determine whether hie je properly administerimg, il lie in hie own person je the
inspector?
Hon. Mr. TESSIER: He je inspecting hie
ow- work.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT. I understood that
the administration was divided, and that
eacli inspector had a certain number of
penitentiaries to look after, and -that in that
way there was no confliet.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 1,. amn
not aware of that. This je not an arbitrary
definition, because an inspector carnies out
whatever duties of .inspection or administration may lie assigned to him by hie
minister or superior officer; 'but it je
intended to eliminate the responsibility of
administration from the duties of the office
of inspector. It is equivalent to wipîng
out the offices -as they exiit and creating
new ones. So f ar as the present ànspectors
are coneerned, I cannot say what will happen; but invariably en officiai who lias
been in the employ of the Government for
a number of years lias no reason to complain
o! tihe disposition made of hie' office. One
o! the inspectors lias been in the office for
thirty odd years and would probably qualify
for superannuation.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Ie it the intention to superannuate th-at officer? Under
subeection 2 o! section 15 you provide that
lie shall be in dlace B of the firet division
o! the Civil Service. That is not the class
the inspectors are in at present, and if

cases was power given ta the conîmîssioner

Hon. ýSir JAMES LOUGH.EED:
If n'y
honaurable friend will look at paragraph c,
hie will find that it is an investigation into
"the conduet of any officer or servant
employed in or about any penitentiary, or
of any person found within the precinets
thereof," and for the purpose of that investigation he may do so-and-so.
Hon. Mr. BE.LCOURT: But he may subpoena any one outside._
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Sub section 2 must be read 'with paragraph c, and
it would nlot be unreasonable for the purposes of the investigations to summon a
person who, even though he is outside the
precincta of the penitentiary, is familiar
with the subjeet being investigated. Take,
for instance, the case of a former servant
or officer who is no longer in the employ of
the penitentisry, or the case of a persan
who may have personally observed something which is being investigated.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But take the case
of a person who is outside; I mean, one
who is not an employee of the Justice
Department, or an in-nate of the penitentiary or an officer -of the penitentiary--a
person flot immediately under the contrai
or direction of the departnient; for instance an ordinary citizen in the city of
Kingston. He may be summoned to appear

So anybody, for instance a clerk in the

assume that it would be conducted at
Kingston. A citizen cd Kingston may be
summoned to appear before this clerk and
ordered ko produce a private book of his
own in which are certain entries. -and
because he does not choose ko produce.the
book he may be yanked into custody.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My
honourable friend *might as well say we
must withhold our hand in giving commissions ko justices of the peace. In many
cases we appoi]nt as-justices of the pe-ace
men who are absolutely incompetent in
appreciating and properly exercising the
powers vested in them; 'but we do not by
reason of that live under a ýsystem of
terrorisin. Here is a law which has been
on the sitatute book for a generation. This
is siniply a reprint of the statute as we
have it; the only change is to extend the
power te the superintendent instead of the
inspector.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Or to any person
appointed.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yet up
to the present time, se far as I arn aware,
society has neyer been convulsed by a
wrong or tyrannical exercise of such powers.
In fact, you cannot constitute a board of
investigation without giving it ab-tndaiit
powers for the purpose of carrying out the
objet which you have in view. It seems
to me that this does nothing more than
make provision for the necessary machinery; not machinery which rnay be unnecessary, but the absolutely necessary
machinery'for properly holding ain invesiigation.

Well. there is an appeal against a justice
of the peace. You can take proceedings
against an error of judgrnent by a justice
of the peace, but there is no appeal frorn
this clerk. who is the sole judge.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But the
Minister of Justice, who administers the
departmnent, is responsible for the acts of
bis offcials. Then in turn rthe Governnient
becomes responsible for the acts of the
minister. So it seems to me that we are
entertaining an apprehension which is
reallv uncalled for.

what is accepted by the existing law; but
the existing law provides that the original
sbhal1 be Biled wifth the Secretary of State.
There are cases in which the original is
required to be Biled -with a notary. Consequently, when there is only one original, the
law cannot be compl.ied with, the original
having been Biled with the notary and the
Cesnpanies law requiring the original to be
filed -with -the Secretary -of State. This
amendment is si-mply te permit of a notarial
copy being used for the particular purpose
indicated. So this is not a question of evideiUce in court, but rather a question of the
difficulty that hbas arisen in the DepaStment of State.
The amendment of Hon. Sir James Lougheed was agreed t-o, and section 1 as amended
was agreed to.
The title and preamble were agreed to.
The Bill was reported as arnended.
PRIVATE B3ILL.
THE DOUKHOBORS' COMMUNITYSECOND READING.

Hon. Mr. WATSON moved the second
reading of Bill 0, an Act to incorporate
The Christian Community of Universal
Brotherhood. He said: It may be wel
that 1 should offer a few words of explanation. The titie of this Bill nay. attract
some attention. The Bill is for the purpose
of giving certain power to a cornmunity
kniown as the Doukhobors. They have large
holdings in Manitoba, Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia. They have
been called by this naine heeause it is, I
believe, the name by which they were
known when they camne from Russia. As
dt6 generally known, the Do>ukhobors have
been doing business -in the West for a number of years, and have been doing it on
the community basis. The head of the
community is generally kn-own as Peter
Veregin, and he bas been holding in trust
practically all the Doukhebore'
'property.
-The
intention of this measure is to provide
that there sh-ah be a counicil of twelve
Doukhobors, Peter Veregin being one, -who
wiIh hold ail the property in trust for the
Dotikhobors. Provision is made in the Bill
for the distribution of the property ilhat
is held by this community; provision is
made for t:he manner in iwhich they £hahl
do their trading; in fact, the Bill is for the
purpose of allowing 'Doukhobora te do ini a
legal way 'business which. they have been
doing in a slipshod inanner in the past;
for the whole community, nunibering about
S-29j

7,000, have been dependent entirely on
Peter Veregin. Up to date there is no
evidence thaït Peter Veregin bas flot denît
fairly by the Do-ukhobors, but I understand
that hie realizes the responsibility which is
placed on him as head of that conimunity,
and has asked for this hegisiation, so that
enatters niay 'be deait with ini
more
businesslike manner than they have been
in the past. It ia a peculiar sort of Bill,
but it can 'be more fittinghy deait with and
better explained in the Coznmittee on
Miscellaneous Private Bille.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: *May I ask the
honourable member if this Bill perpetuates
.the idea of theDiouchobore holding ail their
property in comnion? As I understand, the
Doukhohors do not hold any property individually, but ail their property i8 held
in cenmmon.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: That is right.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: And tbis' Bill ia
for the 'purpose of .perpetuating the plan of
ail the pr;operty of the Doukhobors, being
held in common. Is that the idea?
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Yes. The idea is
that they may by law hold the property
which they have held -by custom in the
paat. This Bill provides, however, that any
Doukhobor -who w1shes to withdraw fromi the'
community and withdraw bis share of the
property may do so. This organization wil
hoid ail the property which is at the present
time held by Veregin. The titie of the land
is at present held in the name of Peter
Veregin.
Hon. Mr. POWER: If Peter died, where
would it be?
Hon. Mr. WVATSON: If Peter died, a
great deal of trouble would resuit. 1 thin<
Peter realizes that and wan.ts this legi8latien passed se that the property will be
controlled in some legal. form.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May 1
ask my honourable friend who has charge
of this Bill, that hie wilh notify the Min,
ister of the In-terior as te the date w-hen the
Bill will be con-sidered in committee.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Yes.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The minister is very much interested nnd wishes
-te be present or te be represent-ed, with a
view te. protectimg t.he Doukhobors' in-terest
ini the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second 4ime.

DIVERSION 0F GTRAIN TRADE '50
UNITED STATIES.
MOTION FOR RETURN.
lI.on. Mrf. TESSIER mioved:
That an humble Address be presented to His
Excellency the Governor General ; praying that
His Excellency will cause to be laid before the
Senate, copies of any representations that have
been made to the Government as to the alleged
diversion of two-thirds of our western grain
trade to Buffalo, New York and other United
States seaports, for export, and showing the
steps taken by the Government to turn this
trafflc to Canadian seaports.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, I arn
induced to put thLis question to the Government, after a perusal of the annual report
of the Quebec Board of Trade; which seems
to be in the hands of alù the members of
the Senate. I learn from that report that
the Qhipments of western grain from Fort
William and Port Arthur to Buffalo, apparently for export via New York, are
growing from year to year with alarming
rapidity, last year reaching the stupendous
figure of 106 million bushel1s, where-as only
59 mililion bushels were exported from
Montreal. And even this may nlot represent
the total diversion of our trade to the
United States seaports, because I understand ,that much of the grain which ie sent
to Canadian elevateors on the Georgian bay
and at Port Coiborne, is afterwards sent on
by rail to Portland and New York for export. The resat is that after. bleedi-ng
Canada dry to build three transcontinental
railways, and piling up an enornicus debyt
Seaports and
in d-oing Go, Canadian
Canadian railways east of Fort William are
getting liçttle in return for our sacrifices.
The grain of course goeS where the shipz
are, and the ships go to New York-althongh
it is 500 miles farther fromn Liverpool than
Quebec is-because ample terminîal facilities. docks and ýelevators are th1ere to handie
the trade expeditiously, and because miarine
insurance on vessels and carg-oes is inuchi
cheaper than from Canadian ports.'
I understand that it has- heen s1cgested
to the Government that the%- shoii]d arrng
with Lloyd-s or other underwriters that
marine insurance from Ca9nadien seaports
shall be the same at ail seasons of the vear
as from New York. If this were done, the
ships would corne to Mý%ontreal, Quebec,
Halifax and St. John as freely as they do
to New York, and the ocean freighlt rates
would be as cheap, or probably a little
cheaper, on accounit of the shorter sea
voyage.
Another sugglestion that lias been nmade

on behaîf of Canadian seapo.rts is thiat the

'MAY 7, 1!918
Governinent should carry out thxe promise
made Vo the people in Parliament when the
enormous coïst of building the Nation-al
Transcontinental railway was consented Vo,
to the effect that ocean tonnage wouid aiwavs be ax-ailable at Canadian seaports Vo
handie ail the traffic of that raiiway. IV
has been sugg.ested that the best w'ay Vo redeemi Vhs promise is for the Government
to build and operate at least tan large
ocean freight steamers in connection wiith
this railway, to run from Quebec and Montreai in summer and freux Halifax and St.
John in winter.
The -war is a serlous matter, and requires
ail or nearly ail our attention. But even
in war-time it is surely necessary for us
to have some solicitude for the future o!
our country; and 1 Vbink thxe aiarming
figures I have quoted and the danger oJf a
f urther diversion of our trade by the new
Erie canal should be sufBicie.nt Vo axake us
believe that the commercial future o! Canada is in great peril.
The honourabie senator for the Gul!

Transcontinental railway over its own rails,
are entirely inadequate. If it is necessary

CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE AND
REPORTED.

B.
On motion of Hon. WV. Ross, the Senate
went into Committ-ee on Bill 65, an Act to
arnend the Judges Act. Hon. Mr. Blain in
the Chair.
On section 1-repeal of annuity-on retirement:
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Mr. Chairnian, I
move the adoption of section 1. 1 explained
on the second reading of the 'Bill what, this
section 1 is. It stands entirely distinct from
the rest of the Bill. it deals with one subject whieh iais no connection with the other
sections. 1 explained on the second reading
that a judge may be superannua-ted in either
of two ways. He may - ake a retiring
allowa.nce equal to two-thirds of his salary,
after 15 years' service; and this provision
was, by legisiation passed -alter the Judg-es
Act, extended Vo two of the railway commissioners, that is, the chief commissioner
and the azsistant chief commissioner. Then
there was another Bill1 passed laVer, which
extended that allowance Vo the circuit court

judges in Montreal.
which a judge inay retire is by serving in
some cases untid he is 70 years of age, in
other cases untîl he is 75, and in one case
until he is 80 years of age, when he may
retire on his full salary. Now, the object
of this section 1 is to a.bolish altog ether the
retirement of judges and commissioners, on
full salary.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: But that is not
the
to apply Voo present judges?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: WVe have an exception.
Ail those who are now drawing a pension
or who have been appointed judges or
commissioners pricr to the passing of this
Act are exempted. It will apply only t<>
future appointments. If this Bill beconies
l-aw a-il the judges and cominissioners appoin'ted .from this day on xviii be entitled
to a retiring aliowance equal to two-t.hirds
of thieir salary, after fifteen years' service.
That was the old provision. Section 1 wil
not affect anyone who now hoads cffice or
who is now drawing a pension.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That wil inahe
it easier Vo pass.
Hon. A. C. MACDONELL: This Bill is
of very great importance. I was here when
it was. read -the second time, but it was
quite im~possible Vo obtain a connected
account of the Bill or of the reasons that
w'ere given for its introduction. 1 was

or te get any consider-ation of it by those
most interested, such as provincial governments, until it was printed and until a
narrative accourit couid b. given cl. t/he
reasoris for the introduction of the BiLA. It
ie therefore difficuit te deal with any one
particular clause of the Bill, and it seerne
to me that, in order to deal with the Bill
inteligent-ly, it must be discussed as il it
were on the second reading; t/bat ie, we
ehould take up the principle cf the Billl
and the substance oi the various sections.
as 1ar as it cani quickly be gathered.
Lt seems to -me that this Bill is, or s¶aould
be, essentially a Government measure and
should emanate from the House of Gommons. There is much to be dons -in thle
way o~f revising and reconeidering the status
of thle iudges of thbe Dominion, and mucli
that is contained in t/his Bull commende
it/self very highly t/o me. I amn therefore

section 1, there je much ini tavour of the
enactment of some such section. There are
further features to be considered in connection with the principle involved in
section 1. There is the question of having
a tribunal or some accessible eneans for
considering the continuance on t'he Bencli
of any judge whose behaviour or conduct
does not commend itself to the people of the
country. Provision is made hard and fast
in thle British North America Act for t/he
appoiritment of judges and for their nonremoval, and thle opinion has often been
,erpressed that there should be somne
.constitutional method, surrounded with
ample saleguards. by which we could in
cur own country secure remedy or relief in
the case of any ind.ividual on the Bencli
*who off ended against the preprieties of hie
office or against what thbe people of the
country consider t/o -be his duty.
Hon. Mr. CASGIhAIN: Cannot a judge
be impeached?
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: That is, as the
henourable gentlemnan knows, a very formai
and almost impossible proceeding. I know
there je in the minds of xnany one amendment tha;t migliit be very favourablv consider-ed when we are dealing- w'ith thbe judgels

But, in consolidating t/he

Judges Act, it seems te me t/bat provision
should be *made te amend the 'bard and
fast provisions cf the British North America
Act respecting the permanent appointment
cf judges.
As I have eaid, it seeme t/e ne that t/bis
Bill should be a Government measure and
should emanate fromn thbe Minister of
Justice and t/be House cf Cemmons. I arn
not raieing any objebtione or dificulties in
thAe w.y of, t/be Blill; but ini My opinion we
are really effending again-t sections 53 of thle
British North Aimerica Act, in providing, as
is proposed in section 1 of t/hie Bill, for the
paymeut cf pensions t/o certain judgee. Section 1 would wipe out certain pensions, or
parts cf pensions, for the future. Lt very
properly applies only te future s.ppcintees
te thbe Bench, but it provides for t/be payment of pensions te the judges who may
retire or 'be removed, or 'who pass off t/he
ecene of their activities. Such a provision
is, 1 think. contrary to section 53 cf the
British North America Act, 'wbicb forbids
the Senate t/o deal i.n any way 'wîtl t/be revenuee cf the country or wit/h money matters. That section is as follows:
Bille for appropriating any pert of the public
revenue or for txnposing any tax or inipost shaUl
originate In the House of Commons.

1 amn net iaking t/hie a.n objection
te our dealing -with t/le Bill ini t/hie House,
but it is a question which. will probably
ari.se later on. There is mucli to be considered in section 1. There ie t/le question
of maki.ng the judges amenable te public
opinion in Canada by some Canadian macbinery, instead of by an axnendmnent te
t/he British North America Act; and there
are several other features 'whicb should
be deait with ini a proper reconsideration
of- t/be Judges Act and cthler legisiation
affecting judges.
I arn dealing ratber liberally with t/hie
question; that i.e, I arn diacussing t/be

cessarily, but would it not be better to discuss section 1, 'which deals entirely rwith
pensions, and then take up the other isections ?
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: 1 vwas going
to niake the suggestion t.hat, ini view of
the importance of this measu.re and of the
fact that it 'wi.il be practically impossible
for it to pass the Gominons this session, it
might be well to bave the inatter considered
by a select comxnittee of both Houses,
a very smal committee, 'with a view to
revisîng thoroughly the Judges Act and
drawing up a comprehensive Bill. In order
to do that, it eeems to nme that it woubd
be essential te consult the provinces.
Honourable gentlemen will bear ini nind
the fact. of which we are ail aware, though
I fear we lose aight of it soinetimes, that
Canada is mnade up of provinces, and that
the judges, although appointed and paid
by the Dominion, are .practically all, with
the exception of those of the Supreme
Court of Canada, o! a provincial character,
and that in the performance o! tixeir duties
the judges in one province are confronted
with many conditions and circumastauces
that are not found to exist in other provinces. The civil 1.awa of the respective
provinces differ greatly, and the work o!
the judges. ini the various provinces which
make up the Dominion is highly im!portant.
The proposition to restrict the appointment of judgee to commissions under the
Conciliation and Labour Act, the Industrial
DispyutesInvesigations Act, and in certain
municipal matters, doesý not pretend to
meet the case of provinces requiring royal
commissions in order to cover the proper
I think we
administration of the law.
ehould have a measure that would be immensely ben-eficial and mue.h more coniprehensive than the Bill ini band if the whole
status of judg-es in the various province-s
were reconsidered by a select comimittee or other means by which. we could
obtain the opinion of both Houses and o!
the various provinces. It seems to me that
the people most -concerned, namely, the
governments o! the variou-s provinces,
should be consulted, or at least informed.
This Bill, flot being a governinent measure,
lias not been submitted te the provinces,
and I would suggest that the honourable
leader o! this House should consider and
deal with it in the way 1 have suggested.
1 think the Mini-ster of Justice would lend
a ready and willing ear to aiding- in the
preparation and enactmnent o! the Bill, althougli 1 have no right te use his naine in

4wb

this connection; but as it i-s highly improbable if flot impossible for this Bill to
be passed this session, it seems to me-no
harmi could be done in allowing the matter
to mature, especially as this la a war
session, with a govermment eiected cn the
war issue, and an early prorogation of
the Hlouse is expected with a view to
prosecuting the war to the end with the
entire resources of this country. This ig
a -matter of very great importance, and I
believe the disposition of it should be as
oompre'hensive and thoro>ugh as possible.
Hon. Mr. BELGOUR1T: The House passed
the second reading of this Bill without any
opposition, -and as we are now in Coinmittee, I think niy honourable friend is too
late with his remarks. It eeems to me very
much like rnustard a!ter dînner.
'HonL Mr, M-ACDONELL: 1 explained
why the suggJ!stion was not made on the
.second reading: it was quite impossible
to follow the discussion, although 1 tried
to do so. 1 am not pleading for myseif,
but witih ail due deference I contend that
this Bill «should have been ýsubmitted to
the varicus attorneys general of the provit
incea, ams deals more vit.al:ly and particiilarly with thema than with the Dominion.
Hon, W. B. ]ROSS: The Britiish North
A.menioa Act, section 99, provides a method
for de&ling with the judges, as follows:
Thie judges of the superlar courts ahall hoid
office during good behaviour, but shall be removable by the Governor General on Address
of the Senate and House of Commons.

Hon. 'Mr. MACDONELL: That leaves it
witüh the two Houses.
Hon.. W. B. ROSS: Very well; but what
amendment to the Briitish North America
Aot ia called for in view lof that section?
The appointinent of a select committee
would mean that this Bill mould disappear,
and that would probably be the last we
would hear of it. As the Bill bas passed
its second reading&, I think Vhis House
should go on -and deal with it, so that me
inay be able tc) say we have done our duty
with respect t. it. Then, if the other
flouse dro ps it, we cannot help it. I th.ink
me ehould desi with the Bill, section by
secition, kili Or cure.
Honi. Mr. MACDONELL: The Bill does
not provide for multifarious cases which no
doubt arise in ail the provinces, in which
the provincial goverument requires the services o! one or more Hig-h Court judges for
commissions and siniilar investigations. In
the Province of Ontarin alone. during the

4563

SE-'NATE

last year or there-abouts, the provincial
governiment appointed judges to hold iiivestigations ini public inatters of great
importance that did not corne under the
exceptions mentioned in subsection 2 of this
Bill, thus show-ing that that subsection is
absolutely inadequate and insufficient to
meet the requireza ents of provinces which
arise from timie to time in the transaction
of their busiiness.

mnax' have been othe,-r caze_ n-ot covered by
the exception nmentioned in which the province of Ontario lias found the need of the
servic-eE cf jndges.
Therefore. if judges
are not permnitted to serve tlîe public on
8uchi commissions in carryimîiz out the pro-.
vincial laiv, the provinc-es are going to be
greatly handicapped, in the muatter of hegislating and carrying ont the law in reg-ard
to property .and civil righ.ts.

Hmon. Mr. BEIQUE: The honourable
gentleman's rernarks -are flot, pertinent to
section 1, burt rather to section 2, and hie
should wait unct.1 that section is reached.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

Hon. Mr. MA CDONELL: 1 was making
the suggestion that the whole maitter be
considered de x.->vi wiith a new Bill, and
that if necessary a joint committee of this
House and the lower House be ap.pointed
to prepare a Bill aft.er consultation with the
attorneys general or other officiais of the
varions 'provinces. I was just about to
men'
tion that during the hast year in tihe province
oi Ontario several cases have -arisen in which
that province needed the services of high
court judges. Chief Justice Meredith was
engaged on three commissions: one to investi.gate a dispute Ibetween the Ontario
Government and one of the power companies in reference to the power developed
under its charterts at Niazara FaIls: a]so
as commissioner in connection willh the
Canadian. Northern: Railway aribitration,
and as Chairmain of the Shietl ComiiSsion.

Hon. Mr. ]3ELCOURT: They are flot appointed for V1hat purpose, but for a different
purpose altogether.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: That is a bargain between the province and the Bench.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Not at ail.
The Hon. the 'OHMRMAN: 1 would ask
the inembers. of the committee to direct
their remarks to section 1 of the Bill.
Hon. Mr.'POWER: I shall 'ry to. The
p>resent section, is much the 6ame *as the
corresponding one which thi6 House passed
last yeax. but it differs frorn it in one
esseïn-tial partiocular to which I 6hall preeently eal! attention. What is th-e evil
with which the !honourable gentleman from
Mid4leton wishes to deal? I think this section deals with -a practice which has grown
up particularly since the ye.ar 1904, when
the law was altered so as to allow a judge
to be retîred on full pay after a certain number of years' service, and after he had
attained a certain age. As the honourable -gentleman fromn Midd'leton pointed
out on 4he second reading of ùùhi Bill, the
Iaw was altered in order to induce soine of
the judges who desired to do so to retire
on a two-thirds, allowance, when they
had really become disqualified for discharging their duties as judges.
The
alleged intention of this mieas-ure wvas
to get the incapacitated judges' off the
Bench; but I may be pardonied if 1 repeat what wvas said se distinctly anîd put
so well 'before the House by the honourable
gentleman from Middleton on the second,
reading, that the cure was worse than te
disease, because since the ,passing of that
Act in 1904 or 1906 the juidge who thiroughi
incapacity of one kind or another wvas becoming disqualified from acting- as a judge.
did, not retire, although hie mighit do so
when hie had been more than 15 years on
the Bmench. Instead of that, the judge, no
matter how incapable hie may be, now
insists on remaining on the Bench until hie
can retire on full pay. That is the evil;
that is the condition which 1 think we have
a right to try te remedy.
The point to which I direct attention is
that the change which hias ibeen mnade in
the Bill aq we had it hast year does away
with the good effects which that Bill would
have tproduced. The Bill of last year
exempted judges or commissioners who had

4574

retired froni office; but the hionourable
gentleman froin Middleton this year hias
put in the words, " or had been appcinted to office." WIrat particuhar good
did that do' Ar. il, stands, wvhat is the effect
going te be? It will not touch an-y of the
present jndg-es; it will not comipel any otie
to re tire; it siniphy provides that in the
cases of judges who are to be appointed
hereafter, when even the honourable gentleman froin Toronto wilh have pasýsed, like
myseif, into the land of shadows, then Ulis
Bill wihl begain to operate. Up te that tirne
the country will have to suifer uiider the
present condition of things, where judges
who are not capablè of discharging their
duties insist on remaining on the Bench.
I appeal to the honourable gentleman fromn
Middleton to strike out those words in the
tenth and eleventh lines, "or had been appointed to office," otherwise this clause is
As a man Said,
of no practical value.
"'What did posterity ever do for me?" What
do we care about what wihl happen thirty
years froni this? These words practicalhy
nullify the section.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUlE: I am sorry te be
unable to agree with the honourable member from Halifax <Hon. Mr. Power). I
think we may take it for granted that many
members of the Bench have consente-d te
give up their practice and accept the office
of judge because of the expectation that
wvas given them ocf a full pension when
they had attained the age of 70 or 75 years,
as the case may be; and the suggestion of
the honourable gentleman would -ive a
retroactive character to the law. W~e al

as in any other case. If a gentleman who

can afford to retire on two-thirds salary,
there is nothing- to hinder hlm from continuing as a judge; he remnains on the
bencli and draws his full pay.
Hýon. Mr. BEIQUE: if he can do it.

more than two-t.hirds of his regudar pay? I
think the position of judge at the present
time je one of the most desirable ini the
country, and 1 think that this a;buse should
be put an end to, and that Oanada should
get the iservice for which it pays. We
shoxld flot give a man full pay for doing
nothing. As I think I said iast year, we
had at one time in Nova Sootia no less than

That, honourahle
gentlemen, is a condition of things that
cannot be justified. Somethingu was eaid
about the provinces. They have nothing to
do with the fixing of the salaries of the
judges, or the appoi.nting- of them. Iýt is a
matter .purely for the Federal Parliament.
In order to hring t'he question to a head, I
move that subsection 1 be amended by
striking out, "or had been appointed to,"
in the lOth and llth lines.

Hon. W. B. ROSS: AU I wish to say
about tha-t is that it is one of the penailties
that I think we have to pay for bad legislation. We are noxv seeking the repeal of
what niay fairly b-e said ta be vested intereste acquired under the statute. As the
honourable gentlemnan from De Salaberry
(Hon. Mr. Béique) pointed out, there may
he men on the Bench who say that, when
they accepted office and, in substance
thoughi not in form, made their contract, ta
serve as a judge, they took into consideration the fac-t that, besides having- the righýt
to retire at the end of fiteen( years. they
co)uldý remnain on tili tbe age of 70 and
retire on full salary. To be absoflutely fair
with the judges, as we are asking th*imn ta
be absolutely fair with the people of this
country, although it is a little bard, it is
far better to le-ave that interest, wJiatever
flon. Mr. POVVER.

it may be, and put ourselves in the position
of doing- absolute justice.
The amendment of lion. Mr. Po-wer wae;
negatived, and section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-judges restricted to judicial
duties:
Hon. W. B. ROSS: For the information
of honouraUbe gentlemnen who have not read
it, I will read section 33 of chapter 138. It
says:
No judge of the Supreme Court of Canada
or of the Exchequer Court of Canada or of
any superlor or county court in Canada shall,
either directly, or Indirectly as director or
manager of any corporation, oompany or firm,
or In any other manner whatever, for himself
or others, engage In any occupation or business
other than hie Judicial duties; but every such
judge shall devote.bilmself exclusively to such
Judicial duties.

That section was passed in 1905 at the
trne the judges received a 50 per cent increase in their salaries. There had been
complaint 5 and to my certain knowledge in
same cases they were well founded, that
judges were drawing their salaries and engaging ini business of ane kind or anather,
and ,eglcting the duties of their office. It
was said that many judges had -one on the
Bench at $4,000 a year, which had heen
increased to $6,000, end that sometimes
they were receiving onie or two thousand
dollars for outeide work. There have been
many complainte mnade ta me by membeTs
of the Bar of more than one of the provinces on account of the judges engaging- in
these outside businesses.
I do not want ta bhranch off ta what I said
on the second reading of the Bill, but I have
made an attempt by sections 2 and 3 ta provide for enforcing section 33. There is no
doubt that section 33 was intended .by Parliamnent te compel judges ta give their
whole timne ta t.he duties of their office. That
condition was imposed upon them, I say,
as a justification -for the increase in their
salaries. Last year we met wvith a difficulty
in connection witb labour. I understand
that when boards are bein, 'formed ta adjuet difficulties between capital1 and labour
they very often have difficulty in getting a
third arbitrator, and that labour is very
miuch disinclined ta accept any one as an
umpire other than a judge. That is a very
important question, and I accordingly modified flie section this year. I shaîl read section 33 as it will be amended:
No judge of the Supreme Court of Canada
or o)t the Exchequer Court of Canada or of
any superior or county court in Canada shail

MAY 7, 1918
act as a niember of any commnission, 'except
as a inember of any board or committee appointeci under the provisions of the Conciliation
and Labour Act or of the Industriai Disputes
Investigation Act, 1907, or as a niember of a
commission appolnted under the law of any
province ta Investigate municipal matters. or

or shall, either directly or Indireetly, as director
or manager of any corporation, company or
finm, or In any other manner whatever, for
hlmnself or others, engage in any occupation or
business other than bis judicial duties; but
every such judge shall devote hiniseif exclusively to sucb Judiclal duties.

That requires a judge Vo give himself entirely to, t.he discharge of his judicial duties,
except where 'be may be appoint-ed under
the Conciliation and Labeur Act or the Industrial Disputes Act, or by a province.
Éon. Mr. MACDONELL: What statute is
the honourable gentleman reading froni?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Chapter 138, section
33, and the Bill.
Hon. Mr. MAGDONELL: I just want Vo
repeat what 1 have a.lready said, and to add
to At. The judges of the varions provinces,
both high court and county court judges,
are, as I have said, appointed and .paid by
'this Government. There, ends the connection of the Dominion Government with
the judiciary. The judges are selected
in the varions provinces because of
their knowledg-e of the law of those
provinces, and the Dominion Government
puts its imprimatur of appointment upon
them and sende them back to their provinices to carry ont the laws and act judicîal.ly. Property and civil rights are deait
with by the provinces, and ail the work

been paid ta the needs of the provinces
in the drafting of this Act. The honourable
gentleman who presents this Bill apparently
had in bis -mmd, and he has tlId lis in a
very casual manner, o f certain cases of
hardship or improper dealing or overreaching in bis own province. This Bihl deals
with the whole of Canada. As I have said,
Ontario is constantly affording itself an
opportunity of. employing the judges for
varions matters-to act as tribunals of
investigation and reporting tribunals; and
the exceptions mentioned in the Bill are
wholly inadequate to cover a great number
o! urgent cases with regard to varions matters in the province of Ontario, and, I
believe, in the western provinces, Vhat
require te be investi-gated and reported on.
As 1 have read froni a memorandum, during
the hast vear or thereabouts, in tht- prov-

45U

ince of Ontario there were êome five or
six commissions that would not be oovered
by the provisions of this amending Bill.
It seems to me rather drastic that this
House take away frozn the provinces,
without consulting them, the rigiht to use
th e judiciary in a proper and lawful mnanner for the needs of the provinces.
1 ask honourable gentlemen to bear in
mind the fact that the Senate, unlike tjie
Cominons, is, a body representative of the
provinces. Under the statute we are here
for that purpowee-to represent tht' respective provinces from which we have been
appointed. The members of tihe Communs
appear for-.the whole people, or for the
littie coenmunity which they each represent
in their own electoral district. Therefore
it behooves us, I su'bmit with ail due
deference, to consider the provincial aspect
of this matter- an aspect that cannot be
considered in jumping off a spring-board,
il I may use the expression-and net to
deprive t>he provinces of the services of
judges in varions fields of usefulness and
necessity to, the community. I quite approve
-no doubt we ail do- of the idea that
judges should be removed from politics or
quasi politics. They should flot have anything to do with the investigating of politicai
aiffairs.
I think it would be the proper thing to
allow this Bill to -stand. One idea in xny
mimd is this. 1 think the selection, of
judges in any province Vo sit on commission8 or provincial investigations of any
kind ehould be heit to the board of judges
of that particular province. That is, if the
Government of the province of Ontario, of
Alberta, of Saskatchewan, or of any ot.her
province, requires the iservices. of a judge
ta aot as a commissioner, the selection of
the judge or judges should not be leit te
the partisan Governsnent of the day, but
should be done by the board of judges of
the particular province in w.hich they are
acting. As we ail know, the judges have
a board which combs eut, as it were, the
work that they -are to performn as a body,
and distributes and allots it te the different
judges. If they got a request from the
attorney general to supply a judge, they
could very easily allot Judge Smnith or
Jones or Brown, as the case might bie, te a
particular work which the province might
require te be performed. I fear that we
are taking away from the provinces,
without consulting them, the services
of men who were appoint-ed by His
Majesty and who arc paid by His
Majesty, -via the Dominion of Canada,
for general services in those provinces.,

Hon. Mr. MoMEAINS: 1 would hike te
reoint eut te the committee tlaat iii recent
cases in the province of Manitoba there
were four judges of a court engage-d upon
a. commission. The commission on which
they were sitting was inquiring inte tlîe
building of the parliament building. lt is
an old scandai and the people know ail
about it. The commission had. to pa-ss upon
the character and the acts of certain persons
wiho were afterwards charged with crime.
When these parties came on for trial,
there vas a great deal of difficulty in getting judges who were noV interested and
who had not sat on the commission to try
the case. In one case, where the trial went
on for, I think, from four to six weeks, one
judge had Vo take the entire trial, and
there was -a disagreement of the jury. Gonsequently there 'was a new trial, and the
saute judge had Vo take the .new trial, because alI the other judges had sat upon
the commissio>n or were interested in sonie
such way that they could not carry onth
work of the criminal courts of the province.

Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: Honournible
gentlemen, I was under 'the impression that
the honourable gentleman fromn Mi-ddlet<>n
(Hon. W. B. Ross) had been conve.rted. àast
sesslion to the idea th.at it was right iand
proper and desir'able thLat judges should be
permitted to act as chair-nen of boards of
conciliation under the Industrial Disputes
Investigation Adt. I endeavoured to point
out at that time, and I feel still, that it
would be very unfortunate to debar judges
f rom eitting upon those, tribunals or comnmissions. Briefly stated, the fedhng of the
labour intere.sts throughout the country is
that our judge-s are unbinased and unprejudiced in their views, and are iu a position
tp render a judgmeut or decision purely
upon the evidence subrujtted, and are entirely remnoved from influences which perhaips
might be brought te bear upon a laymnan
occupying the position .of chairman of a
board. Furthermore, the common peopi,3e of
Canada, the every-day workingmnen working for their daily wage, have a respect for
and a confidence i our judiciary thiat they
probably do not entertain for any other olass
of persons, anid it is quite easy te
unde.rEt.and how they arrive at that
conclusion. Parliament has declared that,
when a dispute arises_ b-etween an employer
of 'labour and bis employees -and they are
unable to agree, they eught not te ado.pt
the old means of testing their strength the
one ag-ainst the other, bringing about

Hon. W. B. ROSS.

r4eceives froem, I believe, both the cmploying
classes and the einployees. The principle
of compulsory investigation muet be admitted tu be fair -and right; 'but if the
services of the class of gentlemen of this
country in whom ail our people sheud
have absolute confidence are not Io be
within our reach, then, I fear, the usefulness
cf the Adt itself wiil be very seriously
impaired. 'and the prevention of judges
troin acting on commissions will tend very
ser.îously to increase industriai unrest in
Canada. For these, reasons 1 was delighted
that this House *Iast year saw fit te leave
that. proviso in section 2, .and I -hope it will
not be removed this time.
Hon. Mx. WATSON: Honourable gentlemen, I a=m sure we aIl fully appreciate the
importance of baving 'labour satisfied with
those tribunalls that are appo.inted for the
purpose of aetling industriai& disputes. 1
have had a little Io do with one or two of
those tribunals, and in my judgment men
more competent te act as arbitrators in
such matters could be secured off the Bench
than on the Beneli. I 'think that for the
&ettiement of an industrial dispute the
proper mani te, get is a first-.class business
man who is familiaT with the business
which he la adjusting. We know that
judges as a rule give their decisions according to precedent, aud when a beard is
appointed in an industrial dispute the first
thing the Miuister or the Departinent of
Labour does is to send eut particulars df
aill the disputes of similar character that
have been settled iu Canada. 0f course,
the great majority -of those disputes are
settled by these conciliatioù boards. In
the best, interes'ts of the
my judgmeut
country would be served by each case being
dealt with on its merits. The judges do
not settle the disputes on itheir ýmerits;
they settle tbem according te precedent.
They think that because a certain case has
been settled in Halifax, -they can settle
one in Manitoba -or Saskatchewan along- the
eame lines. I tbink that a board of good
business men sbould be selected for that
purpose. If that were done we c-hould get
better results than 'by appointing judges.
For that reason I do net think that we
ought te make any exception in this Bill
se far as judges are concerned, and I
heartily support the contention of the honourable gentleman from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Belcourt). I think that if we are going te
confine the judges te their judicial work
we sbould make no exception in faveur of
particular boards or of any particular class
in the country.

MAY 7, 1918
Hon. '.\r. BEIQUE: There may be somnething in what the honourabie mnember fromn
Portage la PTairie (Hon. Mr. Watson) has
s'sid; but we must bear in mind that we
have on our statute books a very important
Act, the Indust-rial Disputes Act, -and it bas
-%orked adinirably up to the present time.
In the operation, of that Act the judges
are as a rule cal-led upon to act as referees.
Now, 1 -wiosh the labour orgamizations
would view (the aituation aas do the honourable iember from, Portage la Prairie
<Hon. Mr. Watson) and tAie honours.bde
member from Ottawa <Hon. Mr. Bedcourt);
but we cannot impose our own views upon
them, and the danger is that closing the
door to the possibility of judges acting as
chairmen of boards in such cases might
very seriously inteirfere with the working
of that very important Act. For that reason 1 would not be disposed to support the
aanendment moved by the honourable gentleman fromn Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: 1 think that the
remarks which I made a few moments ago
have been amply justified and proven by
those of the honourable gentleman froni
Portage la Prairie (Hon. Mr. Watson),'
wherein hie has suggested that a oommission
consisting of business
men
should pass upon labour disputes. There
is the very essence of the whole trouble.
Under the Indus'trial Disputes Investigation
Act each party to the dispute niay select one
representative; and if, as in m'any cases
in times past, they are unable to agree
on -a third party, each fearing that his
side rnay not be properly represented by
the chairmnan, who is the third member
of the board, both parties have been able
to agree finally upon a judge to act as
chairmian, having confidence in his impart.iality and neutriality; and in -some. cases
m-here t.hev have flot been able to ag-ree the
Minister of Labour bas wisely appointed
a. iudge. I have attended, on behaif of emnplovees. probab]y twenity different cases
under the termis of the Act, and in Most
of thein a judge has been chairman of the
board; I have aiso had the opportunity of
obzervin.- as a member of a board, having
served on four or five different boards on.
v.-hich, judges were chairmen; and, speaking froni thart expertience, I believe it would
be niost undesirable and disadvantageous,
to the future welfare of our industrial
position for judges Vo. be debarred from servin-, a-. chairmien on those boards.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I must say I amn
flot quite con.vinced by *what my honour-

463

able friend from De Salaberry has saidi; but
an amendment o}f this sort would be of littie
value unlesis it commanded al-mos~t the
un-animous support of this House. Evid-ently my amendment would, fot receive
that unanimous support, and. I will flot
press it.
Hou. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I amn quite ini
sympathy with section 2. The only question I would raise is wheffher there is any
provision for a judge acting on a commission et the time, this Aict would go into
force.
Hon. Mr. ROSS. I have provided for that
under section 5.
Section 2 was agreed to.
On sec tion 3-statement to be filed by
judges:
Hon. Mr. POWER: I do flot show the
utmnost tenderness to the judges, bat 1
think the honourable gentleman fromn Middieton might modify this section.
Subclause 2 requires thatEvery such .ludge shall. In the month of
December in each year, file wlth the Minister
0 Justice a atatemnent to the effect that he has
complied with the terms of this section, or,
If not, the Inanner In which he has departed
therefromn.

One can hardly understand how a judge
with a keen sense of dignity could bring
himself to make a return of that kind. I
think thèse returns should be limited Vo
cases where some question has arisen. I
move that in lines 27 and 28 the words "in
the month oi December in each year" 'ne
stricken ouf and the following substifuted:
"'when required by the 'Minister of Justice;"
se that if any question arises, the Minister
of Justice can cali ohi the judge to file his
statement.
Hon. WV. B. ROSS: In rny opinion the
effect of that amendnîent would be to destroy the whole utility of section 33, because
it is not a verypleasant thing for a member
of the Bar to file a complaint wvith the

Attofney General or with the Minister of
Justice in regard, to the conduct of a judge.
If we do not contrive some way of having

a report .from the judg?es, it means that the
greater part of the violations of duty will

be passed over.

Memnbers of this House

are required to, make a statutnry declaration with regard to their attendance; at
least, I have been, and I have mot found

it injurious, either to rny dignity or in any
other way, Vo make that statement.

I arn

not asking for a statutory declaration from
the judges, but simply for a return, so that

M-%L&CDNElL-L: Surely this

section would impose a very severe and
drastic penance on a judge before there is
any evidence of his guilt. We would' presume guilt, and put the judiciary of this
country, from ocean ta ocean, upon the

Hon, W. B. -ROSS: There is a fear on
thie part of eosne honourable members that
persons w¶he are now acting as commisfiioners under appointinent might be affected
by this Act. 1 do net think they wouki,
but as it is not worth while having any
conflict on that suatter 1 propose to move
that a new sub-clause be added as foilows:
(e> to affect any appolntinents as comiaisionera made- before the paaaing of tid
Act.

The ameudment, of Hon. W. B. Rosa wa.
agreed te.
Hon. Mr. POWER: 1 would move te add
a su-beection as follows:
(f) ta prevent any Judge who at the tine of
the paasing of thia Act la acting au executor
or trustee of the estate of a deceaaed person
from continuing ta so &et and belng remunerated
therefor.
Hou. W. B. ROSS: That is ail right. 1
think he should be allowed to carry eout
bis duties.
Hon. Mfr. MêMEjANS: I do not think
that amendinent gees for enough. S3uppose

The Hon. the OHRAIBMiAN: It ie moved
by thie henourable inember from Halifax
(H1on. Mx. Power) that there be added te
section 5. pazagraph f, which. reads :
To prevent any judge from ating s an
executor or trustee to a deceaaed Verson'a
estate, and breceivint. remuneration ln such
capacity.
* Hon. W. B. BOSS: I*would like to point
out that the words used in section 33 are
as foflows:
No Judge

Therefore if he hsappens to be a trustee

1 think it would be better to leave the Bill

Hou. Mr. BEIQIJE: There je this additional reason, that we have had the 1aw
ini operation as it ie, and 1 think it has
heen vorking batts.fact.orily. As -the 1ev

this paragraph, it would go, I think, ta the
very root of the Bill. What ve are seeking
to do ia ta' have the judges confine their
attention as mu-ch as possible te their
judicial duties; and by this amendment
we -veuldl be opening a door and expresaly
sanctioning their acting as trustees and
executors, even if it should take haN of
thefr turne. I think the 'wording is too
wide.

Hon.

Mr.

POWER: I think the Cern-

mittee viii find it a littie difficuit te reconcile the views cf the honourable gentleman
from Middleton -(Hon, W. B. Ross) vith
thoe cf the honourable gentleman frein
De Salaberry (Hou. Mr. Bé 'ique). The objection of the honeurable gentleman frein
Middleton ta the amendinent Isa that he
does not think it necessary. He thinke
that as the lesw stands a judge may be su
executar or trustee. The honourable gentlein
froin De Salaberry, on the other band,
soins ta think that it je mast the other
way about, sud that if we ialow a judge
tc, act as-an oxocutor or trustee we are
opening the door te furthor extensions. I
amn net à legal pundit; but, looking at thie
malLer frein the point ofview of the ordinary wayfaring in,
1 think that, in order
to remove anây doubt, it ie botter te- say
distnctly that a judge ms.y aet as a trustee
or executor. What harin dose it do te put
that in -the Bilh? (an any honourable
gentleman tell me P
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: If thie Bill
passes and becemes an A-ct te amend the
Judges Act, it will certainly override the
present law on the subject; and, as the
present Act expressly provides that ne werk
ether than hie judicial duties can be lawfully done by a judge. and that he cannot
make any charge for it, it would -be held
that he couId net oct as executor or carry
out any business or vocation other t-han
what is previded for in thie Act. Therefore, il yen are goiing ta allew a judge to
a-ct as a trustee or executor, you should
certainly say so in this Bill.

SENATE

The Ohurch and Manse Board of the
Presbyterian Church of Canada.
He said:
Honourable gentlemen, in
moving the second reading of this Bill I
may be permitted to say a few wo'rds in
ex!planation. The Church and Manse Board
was originally incorporated in 1883 for the
purpose of purchasing church and manse
sites and assisting in the building of
churches and manses. The board has found
it necessary to give more efficient aid in
securing sites and buildings in the larger
centres of poipulation for the purposea cf
the Board of Home Missions and Social
Service than the present constitution
warrants. In order te give this aid, w.- are
seeking such legislation -as will extend the
power of the Church and Mianse Board to
purchase or take conveyance of an 'd hold
a11l property necessary, in their discretion,
for the purposes of the said Board, or of
the. Board of Home Missions and Social
Service, and te execute any mortgages
thereon for any balance of unpaid purchase
money thereof or otherwise as the case may
be. They are anxious te do for the Board
of Home Missions and Social Service whiat
ha. already been done for particular
congregationsand gniuaion fields, especially
for itB work in the congested down-town
sections cf our larger cities, where it is
frequently necessary te have the property
held and financed by this board instead
cf by local congregations.
Hence the
request te this honourable Senate for an
amendment te the Act of Incorporation.

BILL.

SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES IOUGHEED moved
the second readîng of Bill Q, an Act te
amend the OCompanies Act in va-rious particulars.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, section
2 cf this Bill refers te. associations and
corporations without capital, IL was intended
that such associations having
branches in varicus parts of the country
shoculd be incorporated under this section;
hut a doubt, has been expresscd as te
whether t*he section which we, passed last
session woufld have that effedt; and' this

amendment ils -fer the purpese cf removing any doubts which miglit arise fo
that 'the assots and liabilities cf each
branch may be kept separate and one
branch may net be rendered, liable for the
debts of another. It goes without saying
that there are Balegua.rds, surrounding this
measumre. The letters patent îssued by the
Departement cf State can make provision
for those safeguards.
The department,
therefore, would have ample control in
guaTding. the exercise of -the powers.
The third section cf the Bull arises front
the difficulty, ini some provincial cases, auch
as pharmacies, of carrying the poweTê inte
operation where it may be necessary. It
bas been pointed out as an illustration thaît
the provincial legisîstion of Ontario requires
that the manager cf a pharmacy store a-hall
be a director of'the company, a.nd consequently, if a compauy should, have stores
in excess of 'the inaximum nuiruber of
directors, 'they could not possibly comply
wiith the Ilegialaion cf the province. Hence
it i. oonsidered deasirable 4that power should
be given under -the Act to appoint direotors
wîthou't fixing a maximum number, se that
in euch cases the provincial law can be
oomplied wilth..
I-on. Mr. BOSTOCK: AUi that is done,
then, is te fix a minimum number?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK:
auiy number they like?

Yes.

They can go up to

Hon. Mr. BELGOURT: The present law
is that the number of directors shail be net
less than three uer more than filteen. It
is in order te do away with the limit of
fifteen.
Hou. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If that
limitation is placed upen a compauy it caninet comply with the provinciail k-w in such
a case as that which. I have peinted out.
The last section, section 5, is te rernedy

MAY 7, 1918
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I amn afraid that section 2 of the Billi la able to create some
difficulties. It provides for the division, so.
to speak, of the corporation inito as many
different corporations as there are branches,
aind for msik.ing each branch alone lisible
for the debts which may be contTacted
by that branch, -and it makes that branch
the owner of the property. -1 caLi the attention of the honourable leader of the Government te this. There wilh be but one corporation, and unless we. go further and
enable tihe branch to proteot its propertyto take action, for instancoe, if action is to
be -taken--4he action will have tb>be taken
by the corporation, and the corporation
w!L aurely become responsibde for the coets
anyway. Bo I think that the Bi-I ahould
go further so as te provide for a proper
operation cf the law, if the Bill becomes
law. I have not had time te consider the
matter fully, but At strikes me very forcibly
that the section is net sufficient as it stands.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My
hcmourable friend will rememiber that this
deale only with the clam cf associations
and corporations without ehare capital.
Hon. Mr. BEAIQUE: Yes.
Hon. Sir JAMES. LOUGHEED: When
the'House goes into Committee I ahaM be
very glad te have any suggestions w*hich
my honourable friend may choose te make,
and we might consider amy propoaed
amenaIment along the line w.hich he has
just mentioned.
Hon. Mr. POWERJ: It is My impression
that thia particnflar question was considered

INSPECTION AND SA-LE BILL <HAY AND
STRAW INSPEC7ION).
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE AND
REPORTED.
On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went in-to Coxnmittee on Bill 20,
an Act te amend the Inspection and Sale
Act (Ray snd, S4traw Inspection). Hon. Mr.
MoMeans in the Chair.
On section 1, new section 340-hay grades:
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Is the inspection
under this Act compulGory, or is it left to
8--30i

467

the pubCic te aval themselves cf it if they
wlish te do so>
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Lt ie net
cmpulsory. The Bill 6imply fixes the standards for certain grades of hay, se that in the
event cf ales taking plaze contracts .xnay be
baeed upc.» the partkLufar grade which may
be the subject of the transaction; and of
course, if there be any litigation te enforce
the contran, it wihl 'be readily provaible
what quali.ty the bey is, because there cay
be 'then an officiali inspection in order te
decide as between tihe purchaser and. the
seller.
Hon. Mir. BOSTOCK: But the contrant
would have te be muade accordlng 'te the
terms cf the section'
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
It
renders more feasible the "sie of hay, because the contract would provide for tihe
sale cf a certain grade of hay. Referring to
the Bill which we have before us, loet us
take, for instance, the first paragraph. If a
mani entered into '.a contraot for "prime
timothy," the Act would deScribe what constitutes prime ti-mothy. The Government has
provided in» the Inspection alnd Sale Act the
maclinery for sau inspector to mal<e tihe
proper inspection fte determine whether the
h-ay la rip 'to grade oT not. The sections
which <nake provision for the gîrades are
substantialdy, with ahight ejlteratione, the
law as it is to-day.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.: Ac, I understand it,
the grades in clause 340B, for hay grown in
the provinces cf Manitoba, Br-iti-sh CbDlumbia, Saska.tchewan, Alberta and the Northwest Territories, are entirely new?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCIR
I would point
eut te my honeurable friend that in clause
340 provision is made for No. 1 choyer:
No. 1 Clover shall be clover with not more
than anc-quarter of tlmothy or other tame
grasses mixed, of good colour, sound and well
cured.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGEEED:- Shahl
we leave that until we corne to the question cf grades?
The first paragraph of isection 1 was
ag-reed to.
Hon. Sir JAM3ES LOUGJIEBD: Now we
wilI deal with the proposed new section
340. W'hat is the point which. ry honourable friend <Hon. Mr. Bostock) was mak-ing>

SENATE

468

IHon. (Mr. BOSTOCK: The point I was
making is that ini clause 340 provision is
made for No. 1 Clover, No. 1 Claver Mixed,
and No. 2 Clover, but when yau turn
to clause 340B you wiil find there is no
provision made for Clover at ail. There
is a grade of "No. 1 Tîmothy Claver
Mixed," and "No. 2 Timothy Claver
Mixed," but there is -no straight Claver.
Did the department when dealing with this
matter gather the necessary information?
sHon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Section
340 refera to the Eastern Provinces; 340B
This
refera ta the Western Provinces.
Bill is t.he outcome of a conference which
was held between this Government and the
This GovernProvincial Geverninents.
mient, or rather the Department cf Trade
and Commerce, sent one of its officiais ta
interview ail thewestern Provineial Governments upon the question of grades, and
thie is the resuit of a mutual arrangement.
As my honourable friend will see, clause
340B provides that "the grades for hay
grown in the provinces of Manitoba, British Coliumbia, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and
the *Northwest Territories shahl be as fI
lbwsP'
Hon. MT. BOSTOOK: But I should have
though it woiild -have been well te have
had a grade for clover jhay, at any rate
in British Columbia, where a great deal
of clover ie. grown. It aeems, curiaus thiat

straw are not in the sanie class for ieeding

I

ex-.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Is my honourable
friend going to say any-thing more about it?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I do flot
know that I can say anything more except that we *have already incorporated. a
number of these clauses into legisiation
'which 'we have extended to !benevolent
organizations, and honourable' gentlemen
will find before themn to-day a Bill -in which
the saine principhe has been introduced.
Under these circumstances, in-asmuch as
Parliament has already approved o! this
principie.
-Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Does not my lionourable friend think that in dea]ing witds
this question in tihis way we are pra.ctieally
establishing these branches as independent
corporations in the provinces, and, to a
considerable extent, interfering with the
rights of the provinces in dealing with these
matters? It seems to me that under this
clause each hranch of the corporation would
pract-ically be an enthty in itself, iwith
power to hold property and to sue and be

MAY 8, 1918
sued, and we may find that the provinces
will very strongly object.te our infringing
upon those rights. It miay be ail right to
do this ini a particular case, as 'we have
done in a private Bill; but we are now
dealing with the question ini general, and
I think we are establishing, a wrong precedent in handling it in tbis way.
Hon. Bir JAMES LOUGHEED: As I
have said, we have already introduced the
principle into other leislation which nlot
only lias recently been. passed. but lias,
been on the statu-te book for sanie ti-me. If
Parliament lias sanctioned this principle as
it now extende te such organizations as
benevolent and religious associations, there
is no reason why it should nlot apply to
associations and corporations without share
capital. The provision is limited to that
class of corporation.
As te the objection raised by my honourable friend touching the invasion of provincial rights by this Parliament, I have
ne apprehension'at ail. This limitation
of liability lias nothing te do wit.h the
exercise cf provincial authority respecting
the organization cf companies. It ia simply
a doenestic arrangement entered into between
the parent company and thie branch cernpanies which it may esta.blish.. At the most,
it would cnly b. the public who would
object te. any restriction being placed upon
the question cf liability. That le a matter
that can always be regulated by the province under the exercise cf its authority
in relation te property, civil rights, and
contracts. It is quite manifest that, by
til process cf incorporation cf organizatiens with branches, we could net invade
provincial rights or t.ake te ourselves the
authority which exclusively belongs te the
provinces.. Even il we expressly legislated
along the lines mentioned by my honourable
A riend, that wculd net give us the authority.
Under the British North America Act the
riglits cf the provinces are deflned, and
they could net be exercised by this Parlismient ne matter in what language we might
assert autherity. It seems te me that the
principle te be censidered *is net whjther
we are interfering with provincial rights,
but rather the more important principle
as te whether it is desirable te establish
en'tities grewing eut cf the parent cooeporatiens end being in themselves complet.
legai entities, snd te release the parent
corporation, se te speak, fromn the liabilitv
whieh in other cases would attach te the
parent corporation.
1Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS: I should like te
ask the honourable leader of the Govern-

ment whether he carn gîve any explanation
-as te why thîs clause lias been brouglit
forward. In the absence cf some definite
information, it loeks, te me te be a very
dangerous clause. There -are rnany commercial and manuiacturing companies that
have branches in every province.
Hon. Bir JAMES LOUGHEED: It woW~d
net a.pply te thern.
Hen. Mx. BELCOURT.: It would only
apply te charitable, religious, fraternal,
beinevolent, or sporting corporations.'
Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS: That explsnation
is quit. satisfactery.
Hcn. Mr.. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I have
s, tro4ng objectioni te tie clame of legdis]utioix;
but, as the -leader cf the Government saya
it has been adopted, I wilLo.onfine myseli
te a criticisi cf this a.mendrnent.
The proposed amendment ja te my mind
most vague. I-t contemplates.that branches
may make contracta on their own amoount;
but it does net previde *,hat branches
shall b. lable for any cf the. debtis thcey
incur. It on'ly says that the corporation
shall net b. liable for the debta, which, the.
branches incur. If the branch is part cf
the -orporatLion, and. the corporation je
exempt, ý s net the
branch exempt?
To *my mind it le a hybrid class
cf legisiatien in any event, and one whicii
shouid neyer have been aodopted -by this
Parliament. I heard it discussed in the
Committee last year, when it was condemned on severai occasions. I have ineyer
yet heard any good reagon fer ahiowing it.
If a corporation, religious, charitable, or
otherwise, chooses te have branches
throughout the country, it can arrange that
they shall sake contracte only in respect
of th. local property; and tihe public should
net be put te the -trouble cf -inquiring
whether it la the corporation oS the
branches of -the corporation that ame lable.
A religions society may be known te b. ù
weaIthy corporation, and it miay have a
brandi tb.at has ne property whs.tever
except perhaps a rented house. That brandli
might incur a liability, and the ordinary
public might think that it could look te
the whole corporation for the debt, and yet
it wou.ld have ne security whatevier.
I
see ne necessity for sucli a provisien and I
see a great many objections te it-. Certainly
if this clause is te pasa, it should provide,
in clear, iinequivocal language, that tIcs.
branches and -the property .co those
branches should b. Hiable for the debts cf
th. branches. This section sa"s:
The letters patent may provide for the establishment of a branch or branches, and that such

SENATE

branch or branches may own or hold property.
and that such praperty shal flot be subject to
the liabilities of the corporation.

Hon. Mr. THOMPSON:
parent corporation.

That

is, the

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: The Bill
noV say so. This may be hypercritical;
doe >s
but 'wheu a case gets into the law courts
the judgee do not decide it on what was
intended, but on what is said in the legislation, aud if the branch la not hiable for
the debta o! the corporàtion, the judges
*might coins ta the conclusion that the
branch was net liable for any contract
*whatever. At ail events, the Bill gives the
branches no power ta. do amything -more
than to hold property. If fthat ln the luten,
tion, the Act should so provide. What
follows? A corporation might put ali its
property into the hainds of a branch,
and then the creditors o! -the corporation couhId whistle for their mooey.
I think this claus leaves the corporation iu a very wrong position before
the public if it is doing businesI do mot unein commrercial business, because these corporations do business in the
same way as people do in their privitte
capacity. That clause is net drawm with
the clarîty with which, it should be drawn.
It should chearly express what is intended.
Ail I make o! it is that the branches may
owm property. Can they buy prorpertyP Can
they seIl property? Can they contract gemerally? What is the intention of the clause?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Yesterday I took exception to this Bill on the same lines as
those jusit expreseed. hy the honourable
member for Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton) and I -was in hopes that the leader
o! the Govermiment, upon further consideration o! the inatter, wou]d be pre-pared ta
amend section 2 o! the Bill. May I inquire
whether hie bas prepared any amendaient?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No. If
the honourable gentleman mnoves an amendment I shail be very glad te, have it considered.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The Bill provides
*for only one corporation, an.d there is only
one corporation that could be sued or that
cauld sue. The branches -might, as was
said a moment ago, possess all the property
of the corporation and be free !rom the debts
of the corporation. Surely that is mot the
intention. I have no objection to giving
the powers there stated, provided that the
branches be designated by a special nme
so that they mnay be distinct !rom the -main
Hon. lir. LYNOH-STAU-NTGN.

corporation, and that provision may be
mnade whereby they may be liable on such
property as is vested in them, and may
eue aud 'oe sued. 1t, would be necessary
for the protection of the branch itself, and
for the protection of the creditors, that the
by-law providing for the establishment *df
the branch 6houid be published in the
Canada Gaze*tte, and that a.copy of it should
be deposited with the Secretary of State in
order that rthe public might have the proper information. I arn willing to prepare
an amendmnenit which 'would corne after subsection 8.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I ara
quite willing that the committee should
rise and aisk lea;ve ta sit again.
Progress was reported.
GRMAIN TRAkDE IDENTIFICATION
BILL.
SECOND READING.

The Senate reeumed f rom May 1 the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. MT.
Lynch-Staunton for the second reading of
Bill D, an Act for the I[denti.fication .of
Traders iu German Goods.
Hon. Brigadier-General MASON: This
Bill le ver noderate in its requirements.
It etipulates merely that 'amy dealer having
in his possession German o~r Austrian goode.
provided that he acquires theni after the
passing of this Bill and brings them into
Canada, is bouud ta, announce that f act.
The Bill does noV apply to any goods uow
in the .possession o! a deale.r, or that are in
Canada ut the time of tihe passing of th.i8
Act; henoce there does mot seem to be any
hards.hip in the Bill unless it ie considered
a harsihlp ta discourage trading with the
enenly. Tihe Wear Measures Act provides
that there shall be no deahings 'with 'the
enecny at the present tirne. The Bill, as I
take it, is inteuded tc corne imita active
operation at the conclusion of the war.
What may be done by the Allied powexrs,
and no dou.bt by neutral powers also, in
regard to dealings with the enemy mnay
become a burning question. Different nations
are holding views more or less alike on that
subject. This B.ill ks a beginning for Canada, and if adopted, will have far-reaching
effects. I fancy that no citizen of Canada
is desirous ef' assisting the Germ ans, or the
Centr.al Powers, in any way; so I do mot
think that after the passage of the Bill
there willbe any material difference in the
attitude of the Canadian people.

MAY 8, 1918
In order that we may understand the
object of the Bill, ]1propose ta state a few
facts and give some figures sbovang the
chaxueter a.nd extent of the Gerxnsn trade.
Han. Mr. BOSTOÇK: Wouid the honourable gentleman allow me to ask him a
question before he goes onP Is he aware
that we are importing snything from Germany at the present time?
Hon. Brigadier-General MASON: While
impoortationM from Gerrnany ceased at the
beginnimg of the war, soine exceptions ver.
made iby Order in CJouncil. It appeare that
some dyes and other goode that were urgently
needed by Canadian industries were permitted ta come juta Canada. There were
aise soime goads in bond, and some in
transit ini England and in the United States.
The entry of those goods was permitted.
The amount was insignificant. Ail the details regarding these entries appeared in
the officiai publications of the departments
of Custameand Trade and Commerce.
The subject af this Bill is sa important
that I ask the permission of the Hanse ta
quote same figures ta show that by trading
-with Germany we are assisting that nation,
or the Central Powers, ta strengthen their
armiez sud their navies, and thus endanger
other countries. 'The figures are conclusive,
1 thiuk, in that regard. Nothing ta =ny
cmiud indicates more clearly the condition
of the industries cf a country than its consumaption of iran and coal. These materials
enter so largely into every -sort af manuiacturing industry that the extent af their
use shows clearly the exteut of the manuiacturing industries of that country. 1 may
assure honourable gentlemen that the
figuces 1 propose ta give are taken fram
uuthentic and thoroughly reliable -sources.
Now, the production of iran ore, in G3ermany and Great Britain respectively, is
shown by the following coaparisan:
Production of Iran Ore.

iSo we see that during those periods the
production in Germany rose from 7,000,000
tons ta 2,000,000, while Great Britain's
production fell from 16,000,000 ta 15,000,000
tans.
The next item to which I wili refer is the
consu.mptian of coal sud lignite. Taking
the saine periods, the figures are as follows:

Honourable gentlemen wiii nate that in
1880 there was a difference in favour ai
Great Britain ai 7.1,000,000. tons, but in
Gcrmany cansumed 8,000,000 tans

more than Great Britain. That shows the
trend ai trade in the respective countries.

-It wiii be noticed that in 1880 Great
Britain consiimed-3,400,000 tons mare than
Germany, but in 1909 Great Britain's consumption vas short ai Germany's by
4,000,000 tans. That shows very clearly
hav the trade in GermanY vas nat oniY
c-vertaking but pasing that ai 'Great
Britain.
Now vo corne ta another important matter, that ai German imports. I might state
in explanstion 'that Germany importe
largely articles capable o~f further manufacture for re-export as finished goods. Gerrnany's, imports, sud exports for the year
1910 were as folio ws:
£476,765,000
Total Inmporta Into Germany..
403,985,000

In that yesr the exporta ta Great Britain
and British Dominiions .formed over 20 per cent
of the above total.

After the war, when the honourable gentleman who proposed this motion intende
that the Bill shaîll apply, goods can be
brought- in through the customs. If any
goode are imported, they will be put on

He may have goode

Germany for some process, then brought
back te England and shipped from England.
That man would be required te put up over
his -main entrance -a notification intended
te boycott and destroy his business. He
may not know o! what country these goods
are the product; he may flot know that Gercnany bas had any part in their production;
he knows that they have been shipped to

Now, take our eneanufactures of sugar. We
know that. the supply of cane sugar throughout the world is short, and it will be probably a year more before a eupply can be
maintained in Canada. The manufacturer
or refiner cf sugar muet go ail tbrough the

the notice printed on hie correspondance,
muet have the eign posted. up above bis

raw suga;r, produced in Germany, be necessary ta mix with the cane sugar, but the

land, must take care to announce bimueif

abject of this is te dissuade Canadians from

ÀAnother article whicb. was alluded ta is
hosiery. There are many other articles, but
1 will deai w'ith only this one. The Germans have peculiar processes of dyeing.
Same Hon. SENATORS:

Yes, they have.

Hon. Mr. ROCHE: Yes, dyeing; tbey dye'
well. They have a pceculiar process cf dyeing
stockings or hosiery, drugs and other
articles. No other nation possesses it. The
British manufacturer cf stockings sends te
Germany for a partîcular dye. Some British concerns bave arrangements with the
Germen manufacturers o! dyes. Notwithstanding the antipathy in the United States
te the importation of foreign goods, the
unwillingness cf the people te receive German goods and the high tarif! which is put
upon t-hem, the Germans bave been able to
capture the entire trade in hosiery in the
United Stated.
Hion. Mr. SMITH: They didn't know
they were German.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: Now, the object of
this Bill is te stop that.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE:- We want te stop
that.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: But the effect will be
to make a dealer in German goods a millionaire. The women are going to be the ruling

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: -The

ïHon.. Mir. ROCHE: They are going to

control the town couneilt; they are going
to manage the boards o~f trade. Very welI.
These German goods will have to be sold
at lower prices'than British or American
goods.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: WhyP
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: Because the Germans
know that in order to get them in they will
have to seil them cheaper. In any town,
for instance ini my honourable friend's town,
if thereis, a store where the woxnen know
t.hat their atockings or any other articles

Hon. Mr. LYNCH.STAUNTON: -Then why
does the hon-ourable gentleman object to itP
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: Now, let ne look on
the other aide. Before the war a considerable trade was being built pp .hetween Can,
sda and Germnany. Gecrmany was taking Sur
flour, 'oui wheat, our bacon, our cheese, and
other articles that we had to. export. The
trade was increasing. We were taking in
exchange what we absolutely required: raw
sugar, some articles of wear, and other
articles of that kind-I amrn ot going into
details. Are we going to eut off our expart trade to Germany? If the consuxnptive
power of Europe is reduced, if this zolIverein, or trade combination, or national coinbination., is introduced and enforced, with
whorn are we going to tradeP Alter this
war we shail enter upon a period of
severe commercial and navigating competition. The great nations are getting ready
for it. Eniland-is getting ready for it, Germany is getting ready for it, and, above
aIl, the United iStates is preparing. And

They allowed the British to carry their
goods before, because the British could do
so cheaper than the Âmericans could; but
now, with the increased cost of labour and
of seamen's wages and the higher prices
of everything in England, the United States
rules the world.
Where are we going to find a market for
oui prodlucts? Tell us the nations. The
Scandinavian nations, Norway and S*eden?
They will trade with the United States.
They have their line of communication
now. ItalyP Italy cannot take our goods.
What other countries have we? - Germany
is the main, and will be the main, mnarket
for Canada.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Neyer.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: Why' Because she
wants our articles. -Great Britain will make
a treaty with Germany for a free exchange.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-ST.AUqTO-N:
She
wants our articles for nothing.
Hon. Mr. ROCHE: And we must have
some opportunity of vending our products
and increasing oui trade, in the aevere
competition which is coming on.
England is in-debted Vo. the United States.
Formerly the United States were indebted
to England. Britain must send Vo the
Uni ted States large quantities of- manufactured gooàs. Britain manufactures, in
proportion Vo her population, far more goods
than any other country. Therefore she must
see4i markets for her goodB. No longer can
England hold out to us the hope, nor may
we expect, that we shahl receive preferential reatment in articles of food and in
raw producta which we send over to her.
We can no longer look or hope for that
preference. What nation will en.joy itP The
United States. They are on friendly terms
with Great Britain. Great Britain cannot
afford, in view of sending her producta, to
the United States, to offend, or to place at
a disadvantage, the people of the United
States. Therefore we can have no, hope in
that direction. Now, then, point out to me
the countries Vo which you are going Vo send

Hon. FREDERIO NICHOLLS: I desire
very briefly te point eut thse inconsifftency
cf the honourable gentleman frein Halif ax
<Heu. Mr. Roche). In the firît place, this
Bill does iiot prohibit th.e importation cf
German.goods; it simiply provides that any
persen exposing Germa.n goeds -for sal.e
shall notif y the public that he is a dealer
in German geeds.
Hon.' Mr. ROCHE: Will my henourable
friend permit meI The honourable gentleman whe supported the Bill the other day
denounced what the honourable gentleman
frein Toronto- announces now.
Hon'. Mr. iNICHOLIS: I amn dealing
entirely with the Bill as I read it, which,
alter ail, is. &11 that we have te conaider.
The honourable gentleman was afraid thet
il this Bill went into effeet it would depreciate very largely eur trade with .Gersnany,
and that Canada weuld suifer. In the very
next sentence he adduced the argumnent that
the men who deait in Genman geeds and
had the sign, "Dbealer in German geods,over their deers would become millionaires;
t.hat every one, the women particularly,
would rush te those stores te the disadvantage cf other stores; and that therefere, instead cf diminishing or destroying our trade
with, Cremany, this measuiee would build
up Geniman teade te a greater ext-ent than
was evetr antioipaited.
Secondly, I want te peint eut that this
is net a new policy. Everv incorporated
company is obligated te have the word
"lianited" printed in sucis a way as te show
that it is lim-ited in liability; patent inedicines must have -the formulm printed on
the botties; eleomarganine must be labelled
as auch; .and ne diruggist eau sell poison
without having the word "Poison" on the
label-and I want te say te the isonourable

ma.ny Caiuadi-ane would almest as soon drink

479

a dose cf poison from a bottie without a
label sa trade in £German goods unknowingly.
Thse eniy object 1 had in ris ig was to
draw attention to the striking inconsisiency
of t.he honeurable gentlernan'a argument.
Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlemen, if eniy t1he interest of trade ini this
country were to be considered, tihere might
be a diiferenoe of opinion as te the advisability of enacting laws of this kind; but
for niy part, and I arn sure that I arn in accord with every Canadian in that. after the
atrocities which have been cornritted by
Germany, I have feit airnost froni the outset of the war that_ Ger.many had pkleed itsel outaide of the pale of civilization, and
I have bees bopmng .th.at the Allies woiild
take the means of protecting themmelves
against a nation cf that kind until that
nation had given some sigu of repentance.
I cannot but think that the be8t, way te secornplish that would ho .by legielation cf this
nature, legislation which would prevent a'll
commercial -intercourse between the Allied
nations and Germany until there has been
-orne reparation, or until the minds cf the
German people have been changed. Therefore, as far as 1 arn concerned, I amn in accord with the principle of such legîsiation.
It seorna te mie, however, that it is premature for us to pass a Bill of this kind!'
I tbink this is a question on which we
should bo guided by such countries aw
England. the United States, and France.

feelinîgs to the Allies, and with ambiti3us
schemes for extending German dom-ination
over the worid, the great masses of the
population did flot feel that ivay at ail.
But one of the remarkable features in consiection wi'th this war is that, aithough the
people of Germany and Austria have suffered very keenly fromn its continuance,
they appear to-day to be more resolute and
more unanimous in supporting the war à
outrance than thîey were three or four years
ago. Consequentiy I think we need flot
bother 'oui heads about the sufferings of
the people in Germnany: they had better
look out for themselves.
As to the honourabie gentleman from
Rideau (Hon. Mr. Edwards), hie is a free
trader out-and-out. I arn a free trader, but
perhaps flot quite as out-and-out as that
honourable gentleman. Let us look at the
position. We shall suppose the war ends
in a year or so. In Engiand they have been
making preparations for what they shail
do when. the war is over; in the United
States they are also *making preparations.
As 1 understand, they propose to penalize
Germany, and prevent t 'hat country fromn
reaping any commercial advantages from
the peace. What is the position as to Germany' Aithough. in a way, Germany did
anticipate the war, stiii there were a great
rnany people ,in that country, business men
among them, who were taken rather by
surprise by the deciaration of war; and I
amn of opinion that you will to-day find
German workshops and manufactories containing large stocks of goods wh.ich were on
hand for export at the ibeg-inning- of the
war. Il the war ends to-morrow, those goods
wiil be poured forth upon the worid in
very consideraible quantities, and in that
way I think Gerrnany would gain a very
decided advantage. Prom 'what we read
in the papers, the Gerinans are calculating
on the end of the war, and are getting ready
to take such steps as wili enabie thern
when it is over to regain largely, if flot
whoily, the trade which they have lost.
I think that Canada can learn from the
enerny, according to the oid Latin maxim,
and that if Germany and the United States
and Engiand are getting ready, Canada
shouid do so too; and I believe that the
measure which the honourable gentleman
from Hamilton bas introduced is a very
important step in the way of getting ready.
My own colleague from Halifax (Hon.
Mr. Roche) made some reference to the
laok of dyes on the part of the Allies. While
it is true that when the war broke out
there were a number of dy es of m-hich Gor-

inany liad estabiied a coliplete mnonopoiy.
every hionourable gentlemnan knows that
since that time the United States and Enlanîd have succeeded in discovering the
method oi manufacturing those dyes, and,
arc now inaking thelm in quantities sufficient to niieet the uirgent demiands of 'busiiiess. Tliat process ivili go on and develop
and 1 think that if we wýere to aliow Germany forthwith to send her dyes into the
mnarkets of the ivorld, it wouid simpiy tend
to defeat and render useiess the efforts
and discoveries that have been m-ade in
En.giand and the United States.
Then niy honourable colleague wanted to,
know where the flour and grain and bacon
of Canada would, go to if flot to Germnany.
Well, our grain, flour an*d bacon, particularly bacon, at the preseàt time find a
market in England, and I suppose the British market Wvili flot be closed to us by the
ending- of the war. The United St«ates
wouid probably flot produce any more, relatively to Canada, than they do at present,
and it seenms to me that we could find a
market for «Il that we raise.
The honourabie gentleman from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique) thought that any
action by this House %vould be preinature,
as the treaty of peace wvould override the
Act. Well, we shall see. WNe do neot know
wh-at the treaty wvill be, and if it does override the Act we cannot help it; there we
are. If the treaty does not override the
Act, we are stili in the proper place. I
think that tc> wait until peace hias, beein
made, and the terms of peace have been
agreed upon, and 'the bitter feeling towards
Germany lias to some extent passed away,
would be a miistake; it would bie more difficuit in the future to aet leguisiation which
is desirable to prevent commercial intercourse between this country and Germanïy,
and so punish th-at country. It seems to
nme that noNv is the tinie.
Hon. JOHN W. DANIEL: 1 think the
lionourabie member from Halifax: (Hon.
Mr. Power). who has just sat down, bas
touched the -vital point in this matter. Thîe
honourable member fronî Rideau <Hon. M1r.

legisiation we should, in a senus. be cutting off our nose to spîte our face. As a
matter of fact that would flot be so. If

States and En-land. During the last winter
I liad the pleasure of hearing a very instructive address hy the Hon. M1r. Red.field,
a member of the cabinet of President WVilson, on that very subject. He had with
him a large number of articles which the
United States has now succeeded in makingin commercial quantities, but wbich. were

audience those various articles, and I

tbe argument that we are going te injure
ourselves by boycotting German goods bas
now no streng-th or force whjatever. TheTefore, I feel very much like supporting this
Bill
1 -think, that the honourable member from
Rideau (Hon. 'Mr. Edwards) was, very
illogical wben, after saying that it would
be desirable. if 'we are fortunate enoughi te

SHIPBUILDING IN CANADA.
DEBATE CCONTINUED.

The Senate resumied froin April 12 censideretion of the question brought up by
Hon. M1r. NXcLennan:
That he wili cati the attention of the Senate
to the encouragement of a permanent ahipbuilding industry in Canada, and inquire or
the Government if they will make inveetigation
of the effecta of governmental aid to shipping

in other countries, bc-fore settlîng on such a
Pollcy.
Hon. A. B. CROSBY: The iiiover of a
motion to adjourn a debate in this
House is somewhat in the position of
the man in the story, who, intending
the best
thoughit
to commit suicide,
of doing se unas to get on
way
the railway track, and let the train
mun over him. He finally selected one of
the railways in Ganada, I will not mention
which one, sud prepared himiself for death;
but hie starved before the train got up te
hi-m. This debate was adjourned on mny
motion on the 2thi day of April until the
following Tuesday. I could have had an
opportunity of taking- it up on the next
Friday, but I asked that it tbe adjourned
again, flot because I thoughit that in the
meantime I could prepaxe to deal more
adequately with this important sub iect,
bat beca.use 1 thoughlt irt beitter te wait
until the gentlemen who had Ieft for their
home6 on Friday should return te their
duties, se thiat t.hey would have to suifer
with the others in listening to mie.
I mnust say thiat the ho-nourable èenator
who introduced thié subject. pre6ented a
very excellent case. and, gave us a great
deal of information on cehipping. Froru readin- the reselution, bowever, one can hardly
hie
tell %vhat intended, and when hie ended
his speech I eame to, the conclusion that
lie was trying to get a dTydock bujît. If
that was bis intention, I ain %vith hiru.
The sliipbuiilding&is a great indnstry. Not
long ago w-vewere t.old by the Premier of
Canada 1-hat every ship contributed a direct
effort in an effective wvay toward6 the winning of this -ar. If that be so, no apology
il necessary for dizceêsing, the chipbuilding iedustry in t.his House. The Governnient of this countrv, it &eems to me, have
done ahl that could possibly be done in
the way of establiishing and assisting that
industry, to ibrin- éhips into existence to
aseîst uc- in this great. calasnity. We hiave
first the Imperial Government sending out
a commisézion and givinge everybody in this
Dominion ant opport.unity toeconz-truet ships
on a rather easl plan, the ibest plan they

MAY 8, 1918
could po6sibly eetablish. They say: "Build
-us a éhip; we will help yo.u to 'build bher,
and wheul she is built we will pay you just
'what yo'u ask for lier." That le practically
the situation in this, country, and no man
could take exception -to it.
But if the present Governuient were te
undertske to inaugurate a permanent policy
for ship conotruction in this country rnany
men would take exception ta. such a step.
This la not 4he tirne for adopting permanent
policies, though it le- the tisne for b'uilding
ships; and I thiirk the Canadian Govern-ment are ta loe oongratulated. on their positian in this matter. What havýe they done?
They have said: *<We are gaing ta build
chipe just as soon as itii. Ienperial Commismaon bas been -withdrawn; we will take aver
the s'hipyards that are estaiblished in Canada. and we wiii bhuiid the ships." No further policy is required, but this. country ie
going to, f urnish the. roney and is galng
ta tbuild the'ships. It le essentiai that *.bat
shouid te done. Il the Government had
adopited axiy other Uine' of poliey there
-w&~uld
.1e ani apportunity for opposition;
tiut there la no posMibility of opposition ta
,What they have praoosed. Every one kuows
that the first and essential, battie of this
war vas won, and that vas the battie for
the freedom of the seas. We put Gernany
off the. high seas, and. even if shie were ta
caver every inch of Frence to.'morrow she
'woui'd etiil 'be beaten iby our Alliez.
There is not the. slightest doubt or question about tbat. Then 1 say, honourable
gentlemen, thet if by virtue of the fact
that she had the navy She vas able ta vin

victory, of vhat lue -would it be if
wfe had flot a mercantile marine which was
capable of doing the work which has to

navy. we must ali3o give credit ta aur
Empire for having estabiched, what is an
essential part of aur systern of defence, a
meroantile marine wbich is the greatest in
the world, and equa.1, or almost equal, ta
the. mercantile marines of ii other nations
together. If it were not for our position
in that respect we would, net be where we
are ta-day.

the other side of the House la auch -as wauld

Hon. GEORiGE TAYILOR: The. speech
carne frorn Halifaex.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: My honourable friend
says it cornes froin Halifax. Weli, Halifax
is one cf those places where you.can find
bath the. good and the bad, but, 1 arn glad
ta say, mare of the good than cf the. bad.
I always eay-tbat about rny own cauntry,
Ireland. The best in the world cornes from
Ireland, and sometirnes, I am cornpelled
ta say, aise the. varst; but I do say that
the great rnajority are of the. best.
I desire ta present same etatieties with
reference, to the tannage held- by Great
Britain and under the British flag, in order
ta showv how Great Britain compares with
Germany, of whic-h we hear se much. Under the British flag we have eight ver-y large
chipe. the Adriatic, the. Aquitanla, the. Baltic, the Britannic, the Cedric, the. Celtic,
the. Mauritania and the Olympie. The6e
are ships ranging olose ta 6,000 tans. The

Britannia is the largest and the

Oly'rnpic-

next; they are cf practically the sarne size.
One is a vessel cf over 47,000 tans and the
other cf about. 46,000 tans. The Germane
have twa ships that are larger than eltiier
of these, namely, the. Vaterland and the.
Bismarck.
Tii. Bismarck le 56,000 tons.
They have the. Amerika, of 22,622 tons.
They have seven large ships.

484

SENATE

I rnay explain that while we really have
the greater tonnage, the Germans have tried
to deceive the world in respect to their tonnage, as in everything elise, and have aucceeded te serne extent. You 'will find that
while the Bismnarck is the Iongest ship in
the world and the Vaterland is the next
longest one, measuring 912 feet and the
other 909 feet, yet they -are not the lairgest
ships. The Olympie is a larger ship. MJthough. her tonnage is not as great, ber
depth and length and bearn, ta.ken together,
,are of very much larger measuremente than
those of the German vessels. However, the
Germans have always made more or less
display in order to impress -the 'world.
In the.next class of saIipe, those between
22,000 and 16,000 tons, the Germans have
very few. We have 17 ships in that class,
and the Germans have but 14. J1arn giving
these figures to -the House because à think
they are worthy of being placed on -Hansard. 0f ehips between 15,000 .and 10,000
tons the British have 121 as compared with
the Germans 14. Those are ver>' large
slips, you will observe. 0f ships between
10,000 and 7,000 tons -we have 292 and the
Germans have 7à. Coming to the ships of
normal isize, I will quote a few figures soass
Vo give you an idea o! the relative etrength.
We have 944 ships of 5,000 to 4,000 tons, and
in that class the Germans have 161 ahips.
We have 1,131 ahips of 4,000 to 3,000 tons,
while the>' have 122. 0f sËhips of 3,000 tons
to 800 tons we have 2,650, while the Germens have 557. 0f 7,000 tons to 6,000 tons
we have 601 -and -theGermans 169.
Without taking up the time of the bouse
further on this point, 1 rnay say that the
United States is ahead of Gerrnany in shipping. Germany cornes, I think, next to the
United States. 1 rnight give particulars
regarding United States vessels, but 1 will
mot take tirne for that. My purpose in
giving these figures ie to show that if it
were flot for our superiorit>' in mercantile
shipping we could net succeed in winnmng
this war, notwithstanding the fact that our
navy was able Vo eweep from the seas
every obstacle that stood in our way
and every nation which. had any intention of being againet us.
NoV only
would it have been practically impossible
for us without or mercantile shipping Vo
provide the necessar>' transportation, but
I arn quite sure that this.very question
of the naval supremacy of Great Britain
was the greatest factor in bringing the
Uniited States into this war. The Monroe
doctrine had been preached in the United
States for many years, and it is plainly
and definitedy in the rninds cf the people
Ilon. Mr. CROSBY.

of the United States to-day; but it would
have been o! very littie use 'te talk about
the Monroe doctrine if the Germans had
been able to corne over frorn Europe to
Arnerica. The Ger-mans wouLld flot have
paid much attention te the Monroe doctrine,
and the United States had corne te that.
conclusion.
Let me sa>' a few words wiVh regard te
the maritime nations which were menrtioned in this Hanse the other day-Holland, Den.xark, Norway and Bweden. There
was talk cf those nations going to war.
Well, yen may rest assured that if Holland
or Deniark or Norway or Swedenb go te
war, there is only one aide for them. tto take
and theat is the side o! the Allies. For any'
cf themn te do otherwise would mean total
destruction for that nation; iVwould be defeated inside of six months. The reason is
that those are imaritime nations, depending
wholly and solel>' upon their merchantile
shîpping. Otherwise, I dare seay, the situation might be differerrt. Net oni>' is this
the case, but, se I showed beyond the
shadow bf a doubt when discussing the
shipping question last year, 'the success cf
the shipping interese cf Norway, Sweden,
Hcliland and Denmark -is-largely due te
Great Britain, for Britain helped te build
np those contries. The>' had ne trade cf
their own-no trade arnongst themselves;
but they. sent their shipe abroad and the>'
depended wholly and solel>' upen the overseas trade between Europe and the British
.possessions and ether countries in ever>'
part cf the world. They have, as 1 have
stated, no, trade cf their ewn. The only
country in the world that has a ver>' large
dome§tic trade is the United States. Canada
cornes next, but, I arn sorry to say, we have
net protected our interprevinci-al and our
ceastwise trade -as 'the United States have
protected theirs. The United States have
taken very great care, indeed, cf their
interests in that respect.
As I was eaying, we sometirnes hear o!
the tonn ge of slips, and, as seme henourable gentlemen are net perhaps tloroughly
familiar with the matter, it might be well
for me te give one or twe illustrations te
explain it. Let us take, for instance, the
tonnage of the Olympie. The grecs tonnage
of a ship is -the tonnage measured f rom her
main deck down-al1 the decks that are
enclosed-ail the space 'that can be used in
the carrying cf cargo. But after tIe slip
is
measured
-iu that
way,
deductioqi are made of thIe epace for the crew,
for the accommodation cf ail the proDvisions
and supplies required by Vite crewv, and f(>r

MAY 8, 1918
the enigiiets .and boilersz. The reduced mieasurenieiii is the regist-ered, tonnage of the
ship if it. is a cargo s'h1p; but if the vessel ie
intended to be used for passengers, then further deductionsz are mnade of the spaces allotted for the accommodation of passengers,
wvhich niay be 1.000, 2,000, or 3,000 tons. Iii
the case of the Olympic, the gross tonnage
is 46,359 tons. Aft-er deducting the space required for the crew, etc., the tonnage is
35,047. Her net registered tonnage is 22,350.
That is the tonnage available for the cargo
after deductions are made of the crew space
and the space that is allotted for passengers.
The net tonnage of the Britannic is calculated in the saine way. She i& a ship oi
47,500 tons-, and, without detaining t-be
House by aoin- inte the details, I m'ay say
that ber net tonnage is 24,000 tons.
The Vaterland, as 1 have mientioned, is
supposed to be a larger sbip than any of
those flying the British fiag, but -while ber
gross tonnage is 54,282 tons, the tonnage,
afte-r deducting tbe crew space arn& -the
houler and engine space, is 37,384, and bier
net reg-istered tonnage is 24,000 ton&---exactly the samie as the Britannie. The Bisxnarck, is the gsame.
Let us consider another ciass of vessel,
with which we are famniliar, the ships of the
Canadiain Pacific Railvay. Whiie the remark does flot apply to this argument, I ;anm
reminded -with reference to the Canadian
Pacifie Raîlway chips of the discussion
which 1 hiad hie other day witb nîy bonourable friend front Kingston (Hon. '-%r.
Richard-on)>, whio bas bis eye on me now.
He waiii-d to convince mie that grain should
not be c.îrried to the Oid Country throug-h
Canada. utsliould he sent by way of Portland. He is a good grain mari and knows a
zreat de.il about the grain business; stili, hie
does not knov everything, and there arm
Sorne tines about w'hichi lie ,rill bave to
change his inîind, and I know lie will bie
Lclad to change bis nîind. The Canadian
Pacific Pa.ilway have deinonstrated beyond
the shadow of a doubt that Canadian-grown
grain can be, carried bv Canaidian railwavs
down to thie shores of the Atlantic, in Nova
Scotia and _New Brun:swick, shipped froiin a
Canadian port. and delivered in Manchester,
London. or Liverpool on better terns than
it cani be carried througli any port in the
United States. That lias beeii denionstrat-ed
clearly aInd distinctly by the Canadian
Pacific Iiailway. How did thje Canadian
Pacifie 1iailîvay demionstrate that? That
great body of mien, whio grew up with this
country, understood wveil the trade cotîdi-

lions of Canada, and, unlike railway coinpanie-s that were established heTe before
thern, they had faith in Canada and they
planned to do that which would help this
country and help themselves as well. They
have succeeded. They went about a.cquiring
their own steamers, flot only for the Atlantic, but also for the Pacifie. When the Canadian Pacifie Railway say to a man in the
West that they will iand his grain in London, Liverpool, or Manchester for a certain
sum of rmoney, the man to whom they make
that offer knows very well that he bas the
authority and assurance of the greatesi
transportation company in the worid, a
transportation company that can take bis
goods from the place of loading and land
them at the place of deiivery in perfect
order and condition and as cheaply, if not
more cheaply, than they can be tran-sported
by any other route in America.
May I say here, for it ail bas reference
f0 the question of shipping, that the Governiment of the day have acted wisely in
taking over the Grand Trunk Pacifie, the
Canadian Northern and the Transcontinentai. lIn taking over tho-se roads and in
starting a programme of zhipbuilding. the
Government are providingc another line of
transportation which is very essential in
the interests of this country, in order that
we may not -be wholly and 6oiely dependent on the Canadian Pacifie raiiway. That
is a policy for wbich thlii country cannot
speak too highly of a Goveriment seeing
so tar ahead as this Goverrnment hae
done in that respect. At thi-s particular
tiie. when money is scare and there is
nee'd for every available dollar for the purpose of winning this war, this Union Governiment, so far-sighted. so well fitted to
carry on the affairs of is;, country, feeling
that they could flot bring in any policy
ighlt destroy nnanimity, decided
which
to fiurni.sh. the necessary money and to
build ships of their own. The Government
have made a contract with a C-anadian concern, the Dominion Iron and Steel Comnpany. whereby the Govern-inent agrees to
talze 50,000 tonè of steel plate from that
conmpany eacli year and to have that steel
plate converted into steel .ships. The Goveriient îvill connect up the railways which.
thev have taken over and wiil be in a
pozition to offer in the great West the
lowest freight rates for the transportation
of grain and other producta- froin the West
to LoFndoni. Liverpool and M-%anbester and
ahl the great markets of the world, the
markcts for which ail counitries have been
competing. 'My hionourable iriend -fromi

I -said before, the Governiment, is to be congratulated upon having the foresighit, the

production of iron, and plenty of it, in
British Columbia-nothing is too good for

that in that province they have plenty of
coal, plenty of iron, plenty of lime, and
plenty of every other ingredient that is

Yairds for the building of 'ooden ships
have been established in the province of

would be excellent to-day, because wve
would be building ships and sending them
ail over the world.
My honouraible friend who introduced
this matter, spoke oi the necessity of shipbuilding; but I think his argument wvas
rather in favour of drydocks. 1 shall say
only a few xvords with regard to drydocks.
We are in a very bad position so far as
they are concerned. You may say that the
first thing to be considered is the men in
the trenches. I quite agree with that; but
I say that in order to get our mren and
our materials and our foodstuffs there we
must have ships. What is the situation
to-day? I have a telegram in my possession
which was sent to nie by J. W. Madden,
a former member of the Comimons, in which
he states that in the vicinity of Lunenburg
alone there are some 76,000 tons of ships
on the shore,-I can give you the names of
the ships if you so desire. This is in the
vicinity of Louisburg, one of the best ports
in the world, a port that is excelilently
suited for the shiipbuilding or the drydook
industry. He says that these ships could
be taken off if there was any place where
they could be repaired. We are doing ail
we eau to get ships; but the construction
of a ship takes some tiiue. The repair of
a ship depends upon the damage. Many
of these ships are not badly damaged,
but it requires
a drydock to put
thern in proper shape. A ship neyer
get
a hole in it above the waterline unleSs it is run into by another.
Therefore it neyer sinks when a ship) runs

lying- on the shorei. Nothing can be done,
b.ecause there is no place te put the ships
fer repairs, and they rnay as well be left
as tbey are for thiat reason.
We bave
50,000 tons of shipping ]vin- on the shores
within the harbour of Halifax and about
the drydock. Iu New~ York te-day, and

that there is no problem in which. the Governnient should le se inuchi interested today as the construction of drydocks on the
Atlantic seaboard. In Great Britain every

tention it should have received. 1 wouhd
like to impress on this Union Governînient
the dire necessity of cornmencing to-day
the building of that dock in Halifax, the
construction of one in Leuisburg, and another in Sydney. There is no money that
could bo bett-er spent. The g-reat thing in
the construction of docks is the nece-ssity
for bold wat'cr up to where the dock is constructed. We have such water on our Atlantic seahoard; you can build your dock
as deep as you like in any part of our
harbour, and ahi that is needed is te put
your gate on, build your walls, and let your
ship ceme into yeur drydock; and when
your ship is ready to go out it is not necessary te waît a minute, as there is -always
plen-ty of 'water. Drydocks can be buiht on
the Atlantic seaboard cheaper than in any
otber part of the werld, except pessibly in
British Columbia. On oux seaboaxd we
have deep water right up to the very
shore. There are ne places where a ship
cannot came up in the harbour ef Halifax,
and few places where a ship cannet go to
the very edge eft he shore, even if she is
drawing 30 or 40 feet ef water.
I wa.nt te impres6 this House, and I think
I shall have te make this speech over again,
and I will have a geod excuse for making
it, as the leader of the Government is net
here. Even if he is a Union Government

SOLDIERS' PENSIONS.
On thle Orders of the Day:
Hon. GEORGE GORDON: WVith the permission of the House I ýwould like to say a
few %vordsabout a muatter which I consider
of vital consequence te this counitry. A hittie
over three vears -ago a certain man enlhisted
in the Canadian army, went overseas, and
served three years on the other side, bôth
in Englund and in France. A short time
ago lie was honourabhy discharged, and
presen!ed imiseif before t.he Medical Board.
The report of this board was sent to the
Pensions' Office here. It sho"wed that ithe
mari was suffering disability to 'the extent

490

of 20 per cent. I will not read the whole
report, but it concluded:
This disability Nviil incapacitate hini te the
extent of 20 per cent in earning a liveiihooýd
in the genarâl labour miarket.
Its probable
duration will be 6 months.

According te the evidence and my knowledge of the cas~e, this nian before goîng
awav was strong, active, and able, but
since lie bias on); back hie is no-t fit te work
to anythine like his former capacity. Later
on I %villshow what I arn drivting at. After
th e report n'as sent te the Board of Pension
Commissioners, this reply was received from
them:
I have the honour, by direction, to inform
You that the 'Medical Board whioh exam'ined
you, prior to your being disoharged, reîxn'ted
that you had no disability due to or Incurred
durînig your military service.
it la flot ûonsidered, therefore, that you are eligible for
-pension.
I have the &honur be, Sir,
to
Youýr obedient servant.
T~he Secretary,
Board of Pension Cemmiesioners for Canada.

I innd(erstand the chairman of this board
was proniounced te be 100 per cent physical.lv unfit, and in consejuence of that hieis
teý-day drawing a pension of $2,140. He is
aise dra\n îng a salary of $5,000 a year for
1,is services on the board. 1 would ask
that the hionourable leader of the Governnient bring- this matter to the attention of
the Governnîient. A feeling prevails amongst
ail the people I have met that they cannet
and -,vill not stand for a man drawing a
total di.;ability pension of $2,140 and at
the saine tinie being eniployed as chairmnan of the Board of Pensions at a saIary
oe $5.000ý, a year. How carn le pronounce
upon a case like- this? To rny mmnd this
àz one of the worz, features that xwe have
Žseen for somne tintie, and wvhat aggravates
the nîatuer more than aniytliin-- else is that
the gfentlemian who is eccupying that position iý a brother-in-law of the Minister of
Militia-i ind IDefence and also ef the Mini-ter of Railw~avS and Caniais.
Lt makes

inî blood boit to tlîink that the Governmlent woutd allow such a condition of

Hon. Mr. POWER: Honeurable gentlenien, I do net rise for the purpese ef epposing the adoption of the report, but te
esutrest a moedification; I mean, in dealing
with the report later. The ireport says:

GERM;AN

TEADE
IDENTIFICATION
BILL.

CONSIDERED IN cOMMIDE AND
REPORT1D.

On motion of Hon. Mir. Lynch-Staunton,
the -Sexiste vent int-o Committee on Bill
D.an Act for ithe Indentification of Traders
in German Goodis. Hon. 'Mr. Murphy in
the Chair.
On section 1-dealing in goods, etc., of
Germian or Austrian origin:
'Hon. Mr. CLOBLAN: Befoxe this section
is adopted 1 would like te give my views
in -regard ta this very important matter.
I believe thie Bill i. very 1}audable in ité
purpose and one 4-h.at appeale ta every Camadiaii in the Dominion; but I ïhave to point
out to 'the honourâble gentleman froin
Hamitoqn (Hon. Mr. Lynch.8taunton), the
originator of the Bill, -that kt is quite inadequate in its aoope. There. is no doubt
in my mind that Ganadians as a rulethat Le, the cominon people, the consumers
-do not ini any way wish to advance the
cause of Germ.any during rthis tremendous
etrife, or even afterwards.
That is admitted. But -as to the ecope cd the Bill, I
hold that kt îs not adequate, because it refers only to Germeny and. Austria, while
thAre are more countries than those which
Whould be barred from trading with Canada
during this war. Ail the enemy countries
which are forcing Canada to send her sons
ta the front and ito increase -ler national
debt 4a stupendous proportions should be
included in this Bill. Trading -with Bulgaria and Turkey is belping the enemy,
and those enemy countri *es ehould be included. Tihat is why I say the scope o!
the Éiih
is not adequate.
I would
also
%suggest te
the
honourable
senator -that 'the Bill should include
ail dependencies of Germany and Austria,
and of 4hose other Central Powers that are
now fighting the allied countries of the

491

world. What about Hungary? That country is almost as large as Austria, yeit this
Bill would not prevent trading with -Hungary, for Bulgaria, nor Turkey, -nor the
dependencies o! those countri-es.
Then the Bill epeaka of German-madegoods; but what &ibout goods made outside
of Germany proper? Under this Bill they
vould etill have a right, te tbe traded ini. and
imported in-to Canada. I know that, the
honourable gentleman f rom Haiulton wants
bis Bill te ibe made as effective as possible,
and that is why I amn aaking tii... suggestions; not thak, I want to go hum ons
better, fbut aimply ta help him in his laudable puxipose. Goods mnade in Germany and
Austria could be sent te Canada th-rough
Bulgaiia, through Hungary and, through
Turkey. and if this, B.ill passes, the business muen of' Gsrmany and Austria 'would
take good oare that no goods vould *be
ahipped directly from their eountry. but
they would pas through the custome or
business firms o! other enemy coun-tries. 1
hope Ahe honourable gentleman froin Hamilton will ses the point in this <natter, if
he vanta thie Bill te ib effective and. te
cover -the entire ground, 'whicb aît present
it does nat,. A» far as the uxerits of the.
Bill are eonoerned, I endorse it, and have
no quarrel 'with its provisions as far as
they go. in the 'way of restraining trade with
Germany now or hereafter; alI I want is ta
aupplement the. work whiolh the honourable gentleman wishes ta bs done.
Now, apart from -the merits of the Bill,
this honourable comrnittee -will allow tne
ta Mtate some facts. I can canceive o! no
incentive on the part of the citizens of
Canada to sell German-made, Austrianmade or enemy goods except for the sake
of profit. That is a poor exeuse for euch
conduct-that a man would seli German
gooda onuly on condition that h. iade, large
profits; bis only incentive for contributing
te the proaperity of Germany, Austria and
other enemy countriee ibeing bis own financial ibenefit, or that of a company. I contend that any mnan or com<pany in, Canada
directly contributee te the success of the
Germa.n cau-se who profits by the sale of
and trade in Gersuan or enemy goods,. or
even who profita Iby the sale and trade of
Canadian gooda. No Canadianite-day should
take advan.tage of this tremendous strife
ai war, trouble, death, and blood in order
te add Ua his fortune, ta inerease his profit,
te double hie revenue.
The men and companies of Canada who
do so are no f riends. of the British Empire,
or ai tee people ai Canada. lt is as great a

492

SENATE

crime to-day for business men, banks, insurance coinpanies, raiiroad companies,
munition companies, or any other companiee, to make undue profits ou-t of the
present situation, on account of the war,
as to trade with Germany, and the men
-and companies who make these undue
profits, doubling« the fortunes of the men
at the -head, and increasing the dividends
of sharehoiders beyond compute, are directiy
opposing the best interests of the Empire
and of Canada generally, and working to
the ad-vantage of the ene-my. Whiie the
blood of the common people is flowing ini
the trenches, the men who by and through
the war are adding to their fortunes are not
doing their duty either by this country, by
England, by France, -or by the other Allies.
Yet that is beingc done to-day in Canada.
This Bill endeavours to cover, in a measure,
the condition of things which exists, and
which is not creditable to Canada. There
are in Canada to-day more millionaires than
there -were before the war, and more multimillionaires than before the first of August,
1914. There is to-day more luxury in sorne
homes in Canada than ever there was;
there are more motors -and luxurious conveniences in Canada to-day than there were
before the war. And -where dos ail this
luxury corne*fromi? It cornes irom the undue profits, the blood profits, of the men
who are to-day raising the priees of every-'
thing that goes into consumption for the
maintenance of human hife, and for its convenience and cornfort. There are not vast
numbers of theee men; there is a -sm*all
number. I hoid that this condlition êDf
thinge should be fought, flot by an in-dividual
m-ember of Parliament, but by
the representative Covernmen-t o! the peopie. Theýe was a gentleman who said one
day: " To heil with profits !" I wish he and
others like hii had stuck to that motto.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: I cail the
honourable gentlemnan's attention to the fact
that -we are discussing section 1 of Bill D.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: I1 arn discussing section 1-trading in German goods. Trading
in German goods is flot haif as bad as trading in the biood, discomfiture and starvation of the people o! Canada. Does that
meet the Chairman's view?
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: No, flot under
this section.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: Trading in German
goods can be overcome by a Bihl o! this
kind, but tradingc in the ýbiood of the people
"Hon. Nir. CLORAN.

cannot. It takes the strong action of a
strong Government to 'bring that condition
of things -to an end. Gentlemen, this is a
serious -roatter, and the Governrnent will
have to meet the situation in a very short
time. The national debt of this country is
now nearly $2,OOO,OOO,OOO.
They cali it
$,0O,000,0O0 'by putting up assets such as
canais, parliament buildings, and customu
houses, and calling them worth $900,00,000.
That -is tornfoolery. They are assets, if you
wiIl, -but who is going to buy themP The
billion of rnoney that we owe has got to
be paid, and the interest thereon.
The Hon. the CHAIRMÂN: I will again
ask the honourable gentleman to discussthe section.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: I arn discussing trade,
and I de> not see why any chairman should
interfere, when a deliberate assembly like
this does miot. As has ibeen Baid in the other
HouseThe Hon. the CHAIRMAN: If they are
wi-lling to permit you, I amn satisfied.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: Then keep quiet.
That la the only thing -a chairman has te
do. I arn discussing trade and comumerce
and i>s results, and you should not interrupt me inii that way. I think the points
I arn rnaking aippeal to the comnnon sense
of this House.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: WiII the honourabie
gentleman allow meP I do flot rise for the
purpose of interrupting the honourable
senator froni Victoria, but I would lîike hirn
to tell me why he is opposing this Bill, and
whether it can do any good or any harm
except to express a sentiment. The oniy
thingu I see in the Bill is sentiment.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: The honourable
senator from Halifax always has my admiration, and I attribute his flot understanding
ta his deafness, not to 'bis mentaiity. He
must have been deaf, because I arn supporting the Bill with ail my might, and hie
says I arn not.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: If my honouràble
friend is supporting the Bill, so arn I, and
if hie will stop s'peaking hie -wili heip to get
the Bill through. I did flot know whether
he eas supporting the Bill or was against
it; Énut if hie wants to get it through, let
him join mie and we will put it through.
I do not think it is going to do anybody
any good or, any harm. It is only an expression of sentiment.
Hon. Mi. CLORAN: Evidentiy the hionourable gentlemnan was flot here or hie had

MAY, 9, 1918
bis ears closed, because my preliminary
Temarke were etrongly in favour cf the Bill.
1 do not attribute the henoeurable gentleman's doubt to hie mentality, ;but te his
ears. J have askedý the honourable gentleman !rom Hamilton te improve hie Bill, to
make it more effective, te, make it wider in
its scepe. 1 believe he beard me, and I do
not believe he has any objection te doing
that. If the honourable gentleman frorn
Halifax ('Hon. Mr. Crosby) will lieten, lie
will understand. I want this Bill te àbe
effective, net only against Germany and1
Austria, but againett all enemy conntries such as Hungary, Bulgaria, Turkey and ail the dependeneice thereof,
thse
I amn gl'a
present and future.
honourabie gentleman. from Halifax interrupt-ed me. Hie broadens the horizon. I
used the words "dependencies at present,"
deliberately, and if the bonouraible gentleman from Hamilton will loek at the matter
in the proper lîght, he will add te his Bill,
"The German dependencie% cf the future,"
that is, te-morrow and thse day alter. Gerinan goods will be made in vast portion&cf
the Russia cf te-day; German gooda will lie
made in Bulgarie; German goods will Ïbe
made in their colonies; and this Bill does
not prevent the importation cf any cf thoe
geods into Canada. If the honeurable gentleman from Hali!fax will only remamn, I
thin-k I wîll convince hima that I am right
in saying that if the honourable gentleman
from Hamilton will do as I suggeet, his
action will meet with general approva~l as
makirig the Bill more effective.
Another point which the interruption has
given me the epportunîty to develop te
this. This Bill wuuld be absolutely unnecessary if the Gevernment did iAs duty.
The provieions cf this Bill vwill be very
onerous in its administration. The idea cf
forcing every business man in thie country, froma the whclesaler down te the emal
retailer, the buekster, te post a sign on
every door going into bis esta1blishment
that he bas German geeds or bas ne German goods for sale does net appeal te me,
when it can lie hetter put inîte effect by
other means. The Bill aays that a man
must put up signe at every entrance. He
may have back doors and front doers, and
cellar doors, and be wil -have to peste hie
entire establtshment with. these ad'vertieements "German-aede goode". I auggest to
the honouraible gentleman from 'Hamiltonnot that 1 want te take away his giery, net
that I want te diminisis bis prestige before
the country-tbat the Gevernment should
adopt the principle of this Bill. The Gevemment has the power and is the prelier

493

body to deal with a matter of this kind,
and shouid net leave it te private individual initiative. The Governme nt could
eff ect the whoie purpose of this Bill by
inserting one line in the Customs Act:
"German or enemy-made goods shall net
be imported into Canada." ,'That would
cover the entire scope, and more than the,
scope of this Bill, and would fu.lfii the
purpose of it. Why flot have the Government do it' The importer ia the only man
wbo should be forced te put over bis door
and over hie goods and on hie etationery
whýat this Bill demander. The importer is
the only person responsible for the importation of goods into Canada. W.hy impose
on tens o! thousands df -men a duty -whieIh
could be per!ormed by one man? Germanmade or enemy-made goods cannot be got
into this country without importation, and
the importation is done by a few men in
the country. Let these men label themselves as dealers in German goods. That
would cover the entire siituation. These
importera or wholesale 'men should. give a
guarantee -to every purchaser that their
goods are accord.ing to the law of Canada,
and not Gerinan-made 'goods. By ,doing
that yon would relieve the entire community of anxiéty and o! the danger of being
arrested and fined '$600 and -sentL to jeUl
for six months. It would sive the poor
littie hucksters and retailers in the epuntry who by mistake would have a Germarimade watch, or a part thereof, or a German-made knife, or a part thereof, from"
the liability of a fine cf $500 and six months
imprisoniment.
Legisiation cf this kind
does not appeal to me when it could be
concentrated and consolidated in one line
under the proper authority, the Government of the day.
1 make these suggestions in the beat interests cf the cause which the honourable
gentleman from Hamilton has at heart. We
ail have it at heart. W-e do not want te be
contrîbuters te the' success of Germany
along economic, industrial or trade Uines,
and we do not want our business men in
any waik of life, from the manufacturera down to the retailers, to make
profits either in German gooda or
in Canadian goods or in goods cf
any cf the Allies, te the detriment -of
the cause for which we are ail sacrificing
everything we have. Many cf our mnen axe
sacrificing their health, as wse pointed out
by the honourable gentleman frein Nipissing (Hon. Mr. Gordion). The honourable

Hou. Mr. CROSBY: I adjourned the debate-aed I arn here now. At 6 o'cloek the
hanourable leader àf the Goverunent vas
not in hie seat. 1 stated that the Goverument had done everything possible for the
encouragement of shipbuilding; but when I
came to lihe question of drydocke I felt
that I could not proceed unless the leader
ai the Goveriîment vas in hie place, and 1
aaked thaît the debate be adjourned until
te-day in order Ihat the leader of the Goverumeut miglit be lu hie place while 1 said
a few wards on wbat I considered. to be a
*very imcportant subject.
There -was one thing vixicx I overlooked
yesterday lu dealing with -the question ai
tannage. 1 discuesed tViee classes of tonnage, but tixere le anot-her clas which I
overlooked-the dead-weight tonnage or
capacity, which is about double the registered tannage of the ship. That je to aay,
wiLle a cargo like, coal, plaeter, iron goods
and- almilar -dead-weight goode. the ship
vill carry about double her -tannage. Goode
are cairried on the basie of 2,240 paunde to
the tan.
Now ve corne ta the question of drydocks. Down iu the province by the sea
our shores are actually teeming ville shipe.
1 etated yesterday that there vas 76,000 tons
of s'hipping in Vhs vicinity of Louisburg,
and it was uselesa ta take those shipe off
the shore, because if would cost a great
deal to take care ai themo. I nid aiea that
withl. the. harbaur of Halif ax twe lead
somet.hing like 50,000 tans of shipping. I
am speakiug of registered tannage, and if
yau double that you wili ses what it means
lu dead-weight capacity. Iu the harbour cf
Haifax there le no means of gettiDg those
shipe repaired. There are ships owned by
the Dominion Goverument lying in the port
ai New York to-d-ay until 'oppartunity offers
for them. ta -be pu#L juta drydock. 1 thersfore e.ay ta the honourable leader -of the
Government inx this Houe tha:t iVis urgent,
iV is essential, that the Governent at once
take up the question af drydocks. Looking
at the preseut situation, we realize the possibility ai thxe war contiung for some time.
I referred yesterday to the dock at Quebec,
the largeet iu the world, a dock ai 1,150

495

feet. Itwas supposed ta be finiahed in 1916.
I-t lias been coinmenced sine the begmnning
af the war. I have no objection 'whataver ta
that. There are two docks in Quebec, oe
600 feet and lihe other 1,150 feet. The larger
one le constructed to take in twa ships, onç
600 and one 550. It is essential ta have such
accommodation, and I have no complaint
ta make respecting that; but I do ay that
the Government ehould at -the same time
have constructed. in Halifax thxe dock which
they *had under consideration in 1913 and
1914, and-.for which they plaoed lu the estimates t;he sum cf $300,000 for preliminary
work. They located the dock and it éhould
have been buit. I *desire te, aay ta t.he
honourable leader of the Government
that that work ehouid proceed; I do
ualt care
whether ' it
is
done
by
Order in Council or how iL ia done.
I undertand that Orders in Council
are very apeedy; so let the construction
of -the drydock in Halifax be arrauged by
Order iu Council. We muât have a dock
built lu Halifax. AUl -the darge ahips muet
corne there. There le another reason why
we auld have that dock: Halifax ce .a
port which je armned. An. habnourable member of this Houe told -me to-day that he
had mieunderstood me. He said hée understood that vie could- fot bulld docks ou
the shores of the Atlantic because the subimarines would be able Vo corne in. I de.
aire to aay to my honourable frieud--he is
mot hers, but thos. who arm here can tell
him-that neosuixenariue can corne anywhere uear -the port cf Halifaex; fio sub-marine cau geV withiu 16 or 17 miles of
Spiou Kop, w'here we have gune mounted.
They will not shoot quite as far as the
German gune, ;but we will soon have big
guns too; but no enemy ehip enu get within
lrom 16 ta 2> miles of Spion Kop, which ie
40 Miles lrom the place where it wae
.plauned ta lacate the dock, Iu f act, noa
imatter where in Halifax a dock Je located,
there ie no danger of Germaus or anybocdw
else interfering with it.
Sa -mucie for the situation at Halifax;
and 1 deeire to impress upon the Goverument the importance ot considering the
-malter im.mediately.
There le another
resan why docks should b. coustructed
ir, places like Halifax. There isy lu that
city a large poPulation cd klled workmen,
who wîll be avails.ble for shipbuilding and
repairing as soon as th. drydock ie apened.
The situation ie -similar at Trenton, where
two large ships are now -being buit.
A
large one has already been built for the
Nova ïScotia steel works. There is already

that to the Liberal Government, which

at the time. However, the unexpect*credit

bour vaîting for repaira until the war -s
over. Bo 1 desire to irnpress upon the~
honourable leader of the Governinent that
the Minister oi Public Works should be
asked to send a competent mnan down there
at once. Some esay that the gatea are flot
as strong as they ought to be. I irnderstand that the gates are made of 24 by
24 imber, and, while I do not pretend to
be an engineer, in rny judgament 24 by
24 timber will keep out any water that we
have on our shores; but if the gates are
not what they should be, the putting in of
new gates is not a very difficuit matter and
would take only a very short tirne. The
dock at Trenton has a concrete bottom and
it was buif't so as to hold enough 'water to
take in slips *drawing 25 feet of water.
That depth is sufficient for any ship that
is owned by thc Canadian Pacific Railway,
and for other ships o! the sarne class, ranging from 8,000 to 17,000 tons. &o that dock
will take in almost any slip that may corne
along our coast. At Trenton, as I have
stated, two steel ships are now 'being built,
and there are plenty o! workmen, both
skilled and unskilled, available there to
do such work.
Now, honourable gentlemen, let me say
a few words with regard 'to the Island -o!
«Hon. Mir. CROSBY.

Cape Breton, wlÏich 1 have the honour to
represent in this lieuse. Borne time ago
the honourable gentleman. who is the senior
mnember for Halifax-he is not in Ilis place
now-said hie was anxious to tell the meibers of this House that I did flot represent Halifax. Well, when I looked at him
and considered who was making the etatement I said to myseif, "'Thank God." With
reference to the Island of Cape Breton, I
do not feel that I can adequately represent
it, but I will do the best I can to help that
thit
isîl
part of the province, and that la
any man 'can do. The harbour of.Louisburg is, one of the finest harbours in the
world. It is an old French fortified harbour, and is second to none. You can
build. your dry-dock anywhere in that harheur, -and you need* fot be afraid of the
submarines or anything of that nature;
the dock will be quite safe. Louisburg
is also a terminal of the Dominion Coal
Company, and there is a pUentiful supply
of labour there for the work of repairing,
ships.
Now we corne to Sydney. You may ask
me, why have so many docksP Let me tet
yolu, honourable gentlemen, that Britain is
filled with docks.'
Hon. Mx. <JLORAN: All drydocks'
Hon. Mr. CROSBY. Well, not as dry as
they are over in Hull; but they are aîl dry-docks-because 'there is no use putting a
ship into a dock unless you can make iA dry
after you get the ship in. The drydock has
a gate, and when you get the ship in you close
the gate, and then you muet pump ahl the
water out o! the dock; then you have a drydock. It miiht be well if a similar method
could be used in some other cases. However, that is the way you get aIl the water
away fron 'the ship, so as to get to hier
bottoin and do the repairs which are needed. In the city o! London there are betweexi 30 and 40 drydocks. None of thein
are s~ large as the docks in Québec, and I
arn proud &f thit.; wel are alI proud
o! it, 'because Quebec is in Canada.
the largeet dock ini
Liverpool bias
Great Britain, a dock o! 1,060 feet, and she
lias about 21 docks.' The situation ils similar in Manchester. Theue docks are not
buiît by private companiesi, -but hy the corporation, and it makes money out of them.
Let me tell you, honourable gentlemen,
that when a ehip like the Olympie cornes
into dock and remains there a day, ehe
has to pay $10,000 for that day and $7,000
a day for every additional d-ay she remains
in the dock. The dock iî' a money mnaker.

and they are building ships; but, aiter
hearing the remarks made .by my honourable lriend when we were dealing with the
Canadiau Northern, you neyer can tell
what a railway wilI do, whereas you certainly can depend on the drydock.
II may be asked: w'hy are there not enterprising business. men ready ta build drydocksP As I said yesterday, fliough the

to. put them juta the dock there, because
they did not have a drydack of their own
The «Umâk'e Statea

Governlment had ta build docks, and they
now hLave seven or eight.
We want in 'Halifax a drydock ai 1,200
feet, built like the dock in Quebec, oa that
it eau take lu two or three ships. It should
be a sectianal dock, oa that the whale of it
may be in use ail the t.ime. .We want a
dock in-Sydney because in that pori we
have the great steel workis of the Dominion
iron and Steel Company. EI we did not
have that great iran and steel -works, we
would not have ;been aible ta turnlsh the
plate required by this Goverument, for the
building et shipa. *The Goverument af the
day have made a coutract wltii the Domin-,
ion *ren and Steel Campany'for that campany ta furnish them 'with 50,000 tan& af
steel plate every year for a number of
years, and the company are now putting
ini a' miii which iwiil cost them somethiug like $5,000,000 for the purpase of
manufacturing that steel plate. I repeat,

might also be asked, why locate at Quebec
a dTydock 6W0 fee long and another one
1,160 feet long, 'wheu there la a disadvantage ln the geographical situation thereP
But we do not regard that as a goad reaen
for not construotin, the dock, because, when
the navigation season opens there la a
traffic an the St. Lawrence which. warrants
the drydack in Quebec. There le likewiae
a traffle. wlbich will warrant 'the construatien ai a dock in Halifax-yea, two or
three docks; but we are asking -for only
one et the present. time.
As R was saying, we want a drydock at
Louisburg, and we want a dock at ;SydS--32

ney. Sydney has the advantage ai being
a centre ai labour, where a goad supply of
skilled warkmen is available at any tirne.
And let me add: you cen start almoet-any
other kind of' manufaeturing, induetryth,. manufacture ai clothes, or ladies wear,
or candy, or anything else-in any town
or village, but there le no industry that
employa more highly skilled or better paid
labour than the iran and steel industry.
Wherever you find an iraon and steel lnduatry, there yon find proeperity, because
the employees are ail highly paid and,
though -they wark bard, they epend 4.heir
money f reely..
Thereofore, I dlaim that there is at the,
present time a great necessity for thie construortion ai drydocks.
Ta buld -a new
ehip caste a greait deal ai money. The construction ai suai ships as we are talking
about would cast anyw.here fram $2,00à,000
ta $5,000,000, but the construction ai a drydock on aur coast would. not cost, nearly
as much. Ail that is necessary is ta put
up the gates sud the walls and you have
the drydocks. It might not cost more than
$1,000,000; in fact, I do not tihink thbe docks
already built- dow'there ooot kmything
like that.
TIhen, the dock ini Halifax whieh le now
owried by a company ehould, be taken over
by the Government, because there would
be a great adivantage ln Governxnent ownerrhip. Mhie Glovernment would have - the
advantage of whatevýer profit they make,
and, besides aIl engineering or machinist
companies would have an equal right -ta
tender on any repair work required ta 1ýe
done. At present, if for instance five or six
engineering companies desire ta get a contract for the repairing of a ship, -the company owning a dock such as we now have
at Halifax have the whip-handle over
every oither ccmpaxxy, aud -the otuhere may
mot be able te get a ship into -the dock, because the company owniug it can make the
dock as exclusive as they like. Therefore
I say t'hat docks are iu the class of property which abould be owued by the Gavernment or by tihe corporation.
I thank yau, honourable gentleman, for

Both en the Atlantic and on 'the Pacifie
very conisideraible attention h.as 'been given
by the Government, flot only to the promotion of the shipbuiiding industry, 'but to
ail those incidentai enterprises *which are
igermane ito that very important one. No
later than weme four weeks ago the Government of Canad-a committed itself ta en
exapenditure of, 1 think, 850,000,000 for the
purpose of encouraging the building of iran
ships. Growing out of that programme a contract has been entered into 'betrween the Dominion Government and the Dominion Steel
and Coal Company that will permit of àhat
company building the first steel plate miii
in Canada-an enterprise which wilI involve an expenditure by that corporation of
at least .$5,000,000, and an obligation on
the part of Canada to take, within the next
five yeara, no lbas than 250,000 tons of steel
at a fixed price which will enable the company to enter suocessfully upon the oiiga.
tion which they have assumed.
1 may aay that tairough the intervention
oi this Government shipbuilding upon the
Pacifie coast has received a considerable
inipetus. The honoura-ble gentleman froin
Westminster (Han. J. D. Taylor) directed
aur attention the other day to the establishment of shipbuilding yards in British
Columbia. 1 arn informed that no lesa than
twelve woden ships are now in those yards
awaiting t.he installation o! equipment before being- Iauncbed. I understand that ane
or more of those ships have &Iready been
successfully launched, and it is te 'be hoped
that that industry will develcip inte much
more important proportions than it has at
present reached. Iron shipbullding is not
inciuded in the indu.stry on the Pacifie
coast, I arn infornied. True, that industry
is in its infancy, and I arn not at ail *urpriseci that tnere is more or less impatience
and even dissatis>faction, on the part of hon.
ourable gentlemen who came - roni that
province, with wbat has already been done.
Dissatisfaction lies at the very basis of ail
prog-ress. If we were conten'ted with the
degree of enterprise which we have reached,
we wouid -grow stagnant before a great
length of time passed over aur heads;
therefore it is fortunate that a mieazure ai
dis'conten't at present progress should characterize our people on both coasts, and I
am not surprised at my honoura-ble friend
from Halifax (Hon. Mr. Crosby) expressing
hirnself in the manner he has done this
afternoon.

We ap'preciate thie magnificent heritage'
whîch Canada possesses in aur ports on
both coasts, and -the great possibilities that
await this country if proper attention is
given to the development of our 8hipping.
Yet, -at the eame time, it cannait be overlooksd that there are limitations ta what
this Government may and can do. As I
think I pointed out the other day, gavernmental machinery is not calculated to bring
about te the zame extent as private enterprise the development of great industries,
and the mnost ws can hope is tijati a government may prcperly becosme aeized of the
importance of acting in accordance with
assisting in every possible way te develop
the resources of the country. I think I arn
justified in saying that th, . Governmeut
ha8 given an earnest of its desire to give
due consideration ta every line of industry
and activity, and ta the deveiopment af ou e
naturai resources in whitsoever way their
human ability wiii permit. They have
demonstrated that desire by the very large
aums which they have apprapriated for the
purpose of hslping those different activities. But I hope, honoura-ble gentlemen,
that this will simuly be a beginning of
the programme whieh this Gavernment- wilI
adopt for the purpase of enoouraging,
stimulating, and giving the greatest possible impetus ta the develapment af the
trade and the naturai resaurces of Canada.
I eau assure my honourable friendi that
the minister who. is at the head o! the department on 'which will depend the initiation o! moat of these enterprises, Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne, is oniy tee anxieus te know
the wishes of the public in a practical way,
s0 that he may give ail the assistance lie
can tewards carrying eut those great enterprises an bath coasts. Under these circumstances I hope that ws may not be disappointed in the autcome of the programme
which is net anly being carried on but
which ia ta be enlarged in the near future.
My hbnourable friend frein Halifax <Hon.
Mr. Crosby) has made speciai reference ta
the importance of increasing aur drydockage facilities an the Atlantic coast. I may
say that, even prier te 1911 ail the recent
governments of Canada have been very
anxious te assist in prometing the building
of drydecks, recognizing the necessity of
these very important enterprises. The Government which immsdiateiy preceded the
present one piaced upon the statute book
very substantiai encouragement- te the
building of drydeeks. The legislation whièh
for some years had stood upon ths statute

SENATE
book, by which the bonds of those 'who
would enter upon the building of drydocks
were guaranteed, has been improved, so
that to-day we have about as generous a
measure as could be introduced by any
Government. If more consideration were
given to that statute it seems to me greater
attention would be paid to the building of
drydooke than has been done in the past,
for that legisiation enables capitalists who
have the adequate enterprise and confidence to secure a guar 'antee by the Government of Canada of praetically the entire
issue of bonds necessary for such an enterprise. If the public gave more consideration to existing legisiation, lookIng to the
development of great public enterprises
such as this to which 1 have a]iluded, possibly -greater encouragement might be apparent in the facilities which are within
reach for not only financing such activities, but for carrying them to their ultimate
conclusion.
I am glad to assure my honourable friend
who has directed the attention of this
House to this very important matter, that
I will draw the attention of the Government to the discussion of this important
subject to which we have listenied with
very great pleasure in this Chamber.

Hon. L, LAVERGNE: Before, the report

of the hozicurable leader of the Government. la this report legalP Yesterday was
a. legal holiday for -the whole o! Canada.
The Committee est yesterday, but I oppoaed
tha- aitting of tihat Commilttee, as honourable gentlemen will remeinher. Il yon refer
to the statute you 'will sec that ÀAcensionDay is a holiday not only in Québec but in
Ontario and every other province of the
Dominion. When I raised the point yeaterday the honourable gentleman told -me
he was not sure about it, and 1 haed not the
statuts Ibefore me at the moment; but I
have zines looked it up and I ms.y tell you
that subsection il of section 34, chapter 1,
mays that the word "'holiday" comprises
Ascenision Day, Dominion Day, etc.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 1 should
like to assure mzy honourable friend, with
reference to any doubt which existe in his
inid as to the validity of anything Parliament may do, tihat Parliament may ait on
any d-ay in the year. Parliament is not
*in any way restricted by statutory -hoolidays.
In the second place, Ascension Day, under
chsapter 119, section 43, paragraph b, is a
holiday in the province of Quebec only. My
honouraible fliend' (Hon. Mr. Lavergne)
*referred only to thc Interipretation A-et; but
M ho will look et the chapter to which I
have referred he will sec that it is a holiday
in the province of Quebec only.
Hon. Mr. LAVERGNE: The lInterpretati-)n Act is included in thc Reviscd Statutes,
which specify what days are legal holidays.
I am sure a lawyer would not differ from
my contention.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEFED: No; the
Interpretation Act is intcnded only to place
a construction upon the 'word "«holiday"
wherever it may be found in thc statute,
and that iiiterpretation will 1,e limnited by
thc express phraseology. of tihe statute. In
the statute to which I re!erred-and it is-

THE 6YSTEM 0F GIRÂNTING DIVORCE.
Hon. W. B. WVILLOUGHBY rose in
docordance with the foiiowing notice:
That he wiii cali the attention of the Government to the advIsability of changingathe system of granting divorce by Act of Parliament,
and willIinquire o,! the Government:
1. Is there any Intention on the part of the
Government to ask from the Iruperial Parliament an axnendment of the British North
Âmnerica Àct ao un to confer- on the orovinceS
tii. soie Jurlaiotion ovér marriage and- divorce?
2. If no such intention, if the Government
han considered the propriety of prescribing unitormn statutory gronde of divorce, leaving to the
]Provincial Courts the procedure to be tollowed
with the right to exercise ail poweru and grant
aU remedies enJoyed by the Probate and Divorce Division of the ]Elgh Court of Justice In
Ehgland?
S. if no intention to, act under 1 or 2, If the

Government

han considered the question of

establishment Dominion Divorce Courts?

He said: In miaking this inquirY I do
not in-tend 'to address the House at anY
]ength to-day, because, if the Governrnent
ahould give an answer in the affirmative te
any one of the three queries that I propauhd, no furtheir discussion will b. necessary on my part. Il, -on the other hand,
the anaver of the Governrnunt should b.
that no immediate action la contemplated.
or no acteion 'whatever, then et a future
session of the Huse I will raies the queetion ini such.àa forra that we May perhtpS
have a fuil debate on the subjet, because
I recognize it as one of very grest imPcrt-.
ance. However, I wish tai jaetify my action
in placing the question on the Order -Paper
by some facta and arguments that might t>.
of use in connection. vith it.
I recognize ths.t there would not perhazps
be s unanimous feeling in this House or in
the lover Hlouse as ta the advisability -of
dealing with divorce at ail. Certain gentlemen are unwilling. on account of their
religious persuasion, to deal with the subject of divorce. I do no-t inake that comment for the purpose of finding any f ault
with them. But there is a large ma.jority
in both House, and -a mucli laTger majority of people throughout Canada, whc b..lieve the time bas ocis -when w. should
deal adequately with the question af divorce.
In putting these questions on the Order
Paper I had no intention af czefiecting on
the competenci or zeal of the gentlemen
who nov discharge the duties of the Divorce Comitte ai this Hanse. 1 wauld
not for a maoment have it in-ferred-fromn
anything I may say that 1 have not en-tire
cqnfidence%in their -ability to deal wisely
and adequately -wit.h the subjec
sof
divorce;

but the considerations I adduce in connect.ion with it are much vider than that
question would b.: There is s gra'wfng
sentjiment for divorce in Canada, perhaps
in keeping with alil'the more advanced
nations ai the wornd. We *may deplore it
as not a good tendency ini public poiicy,
but as public -men we cannot but recognàize
that there is an increasing nunaber of divorces in ail' the more d-emocratic countries
ai the world. There ia a popu1ar -conception that divorce is rather a novel thing
in Canada. Not to weary the Hanse with
any extended statistica, I will content snyself with quoting figures ta show that wo
have fbeen granting in this count7ry divorces
in an increasingly large n-nniber, not aeily
by the Parliament of Canada, but by 'the
variaus courts ai Canada which adnittedly
have the, power ta do ao up ta the present.
The figures ta which I refer are taken from
t.he Uniited, 8tates apecial report on the censua of 1909. This is a statement of 'the divorces granted in Canada trom, 1868 to 19N4:

the et.atistics diown from 1906 to the.
Present time, because, as I said -in opening, I did not intend, at Whs sesson
of the House in any event, todiscuas the.
subject comprehienasively. 1 have warrant in
saying, however, that -thenuinber of divorces
in Canada is rapidiy increasing. Not oniy

gra.nting- of divorce is any great injustice to

Now, it is commonly forgotten by «nany
people, I will not aay in this House, but by
public mien, frcm Ontario anoatly, -that diivurcee have been granted in Britial Oolumbia sud in two of iLhe IMaritime Provinces,
narnely, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick,
and- that Prince Ed-ward Joland bias a
divorce coeurt-a rather cumbersome one,
it ie true, and aipparently eune Of which
nobody has tLaken advantage. Reoently
the subject has -beccene even more important in view of a late decision of the appeal
court of Manitoba. For many months, since
I had been looking into the question more
particularly, 1 hiad, rightly or wrongly, come
to the conclusion that in Saskatchewian, the
province frein which I have the honour to
corne, we had -the (right to have divorces by
virtue of the Northwest Ierritories Act. My
opinion would not be wcrth much, uer the
r&asoning by which I arrived at that conclusion; but it was the rea.soning by which
the appeal court of Manitoba lias lately
pronorunced unanimous judgunent, holding
that the province of Manitoba lias the
right of divorce. Ini Saskatchewan we have
the Northwest Territeries Act pumsd
* by the Parliament of Canada, which
adopted and introduced the civil and
crirninal law of England es it was
in force on the .15th ef July, 1870, and that
law has been oontinued in Saskatchewan by
the Saskatchewan Act. The law that wasHon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

applicable to Saskatchewan would be applicable to the province of Alberta, for the
very sanie provisions of the Northwest Territories Act of 1886 are applicable to Alberta,
which law was passed before the province
carne into existence. By the Alberta Act
the very sane provisions -have been
the
ooutinued es we have themin l
province of Saskatchewan. It is by virtue
of those provisions, and a similar provision
relatiug to Manitoba, that it has been held,
and is now held for the first time authoritatively, that they have the right in the
provinoe of- Manitoba te grant divorces. If
that judgment should be carried fu.rther, as
perhaps lt snay lie te the Privy COuncil,
we may have sus ts.ied this newiYasserted right on the part cf the
people of Manitoba, corresponding with
s right of the other two prairie provinces,
of havmng -divorce courts in these proyinces; because individually I arn verY
strongly cf opinion-asnd I think I Icnow
what the sentiment is in Saskatchewanrthat if it is once held 'that we have the riglit
te go to our owu courts in our ocwn
province for divorce, rules dealing with the
grainting of divorces will be made by the
judges for the purpo'se cf camring out that
law.
.The history of divorce in England is of
course a very.interesting one. Divorce as
vie understatnd it, the ahsolifte separiation
of man and wife, the breaking cf the Marniage tie, only came into force after the
Reformation. That did not apparently
satisfy the public mind cf England, for,
even during a period e.arlier than. applications te the House cf Lords absolute divorces were granted in England; but it becarne
necessary to establiali a prooodure snd a
form other than the old ecclesiastical court
for the purpose of granting those divorces.
The result was, as we know, that Lord
Roos's case,-I think in 1666, speaking frorn
memcry, was the firet recorded case of
Parlismentary divorce granted by the J{ouse
of Lords. Frcrn th-at turne on tc the establishment of the Matrimonial and Divorce
Court iii 1857, we find, a. continu ally increasing nuwmber cf divorces granted
by the House cf Lords in England.
It was felt, however, that the machinery
created by the standing rules of the House
cf Lords were oppressive, and in a.ny
event 'that they led te very large expenditure on the part of applicants for divorce.
Those of the honourable gentlemen who
lied anything te do with divorce will remember that two conditions were precedent te

judicial function. Anybody who reads the
old debates in the English Parliament in
connection with the trial of election petitions by the House of Parliament will find
that it was thought that the constitution
would éo te smash if Parliament were to
surrender the right te try election petitions;
but Parliament decReed otherwise, I think
wieely, and, as we ail know, they relegated,
to the courts. of justice the trial of election
petitions.
I know that it ie a peculiar attribute of
all bodies and individuals not to want to
divest ourselveà of any of the authority
that we now exercise, and I dare say Parliament might be reluctant to surrender t.he
right te deal with divorce. It la well known
te gentlemen who have had the honour of a
much longer mernbership 'in this House
than I have that lobbying in connection
with divorce persistently does go on. 'I amn
far fren insinuating, f ar from even
thinking, that the gentlemen who occupy
seats on the Senate Divorce Committee are
influenced by it; but it is an insuit to our
ideas of granting legal rights of a purely
judicial nature that the judge, in this case
a memnber of the Divorce Committee, ehould
be at. ail subjected te approach by anybody
wanting or resisting a divorce.
At the present 'ime, iu our divorce courts
as they are esta-blished in Canada, the
causes lor which divorces are granted are
not uniform, and il we are going to have
divorce courts in the tlhree prairie provinces
lin addition to thèse that already have the
right to grant divorce, I predict «a greater
diversity of causes for which divorces may
be granted. Anybody familiar with the
American history of divorce, not a very
savory one in inany respects, will know
that there is a very considerable, variety
of legal causes for which. a divorce may
be granted. Some of the western courts
have a tendency, I arn gls-d to say, se far
as I amn familiar witlh them, to tighten up
a littie, the conditions as to residence have
been -made more stringent, in nearly al
the western states; and the grounds for
which divorces. are grantable are growlng
leas in some of those states than they were
ten or fifteen years ago. But there is now
inl Canada a certain dieparity in the causes
for which divorces may be granted, and
that is not desirable. I think inyseli. if I
may venture an opinion, that it would be
ex'treniely desira-ble to haïve in Canada
statutory grounds of divorce which should
be applicable -ail over the Dominion, and'
that there should be nio question at ail of
a divorce being granted in one province
more readily than it could be granted iu
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

another, or of one province having a cause
for which a divorce may be granted, but
for which. it could not be granted in another
province.
The.se are, te my mmnd, fundementai
objections to the practical carrying out by
this Parliament of the function of granting
divorce. 0f course, it is obvious, and I
do not overlook the fact, that divorce
is one of tihe -euh jes
asg'ned by
merica
Act
te
the British North
the jurisdiction of the Parliament of
Canada. Nor arn I uni amiliar with the
reasons which the fathers ef Confederation
had for se assigning it, as we find them
given in the Confederation debates. But
public sentiment lu coinnection with divorce
bhas advanced a long way since 1867. It
had advanced a long way in England until
1857, when it compelled, as I have said* the
establishmnent cyf the court, and then etill
further until 1873; and we find in England
at the present Lime that furtoher amendments have been suggested with respect te
the euhject, te widen the seope ci the
Act, giving te the woinan an aibsointe equality witjh the main in the granting of divorce.
1 arn glad to say that the Senate of Canada
has recognized the absohite equality of man
and woman in the granting of divorce. I
think it is only keeping with our recognition
of the increased respect man owes te woman
in this century lu which. we live.
As I was sayîng, I think there are many
fundamental difficulties in the granting by
Parliarnent cf adequate remedies. I said
a moment ago that we have a federal
systern in Canada, lu whidh property snd
civil rights are allocated to the jurisdiction
of the provinces; and in looking through
the decisions-in this I speak subject cf
course to correction-I have net found
more than two or three cases lu
which this House has sought to do anything Other than grant a divorce. I have
looked at the Campbell case away back un
1879, lu which you gave maintenance, and
the Riddell case, in which you gave the
eutiotdy of children; but for long years-I
think I arn waxranted in saying practically
from the beginning--4rom 1867-this House
bits deaIt with only one phase, namely, the
dissolution of the marriage tie. I do not
know whether the Divorce Cominittee and
tliis House feit the danger of gettlug on
forbidden ground and trespassing on the
rights of the provinces in deallug with the
auxiliiary and ancillary things that are
usually connected witih divorce. There is
the question of maintenance. IL may be,
and perhaps correctly, argued-I know it

MAÏ 10, 1918
is the opinion cited by Mr. Todd-that tiat
question was absolutely ancillary to divorce.
There, is the question of the custody of
children; there is the question of the
property rights of the individuals at the
tixne of maxrriage; and there are other questions that may arise and should properly
be deait wiùih. It may be answered to me:
"'Yes, we can grant divorces -and continue
to grant themn here under the British North
America Act; but forsooth the provinces
have under that Aot the residuum of ail the
powers that we do flot exercise, and they
cani grant these civil riglits, and deal with
maintenance, the custody of children, the
question of property, etc. But I would
point out the propriety of the one court in
one trial and at one time dealing with. al
the rights involved, and I have not the
sligahtest doubt that the members of the
Divorce Committee have feit the difficulty
under which, they are labouring when in
granting toa wife a divarce from, her huaband, who lias committed adultery and
who is negiecting bis wife, they make no
order at ail for the maintenance of the wife;
and I question very seriously the ability
of any court in Canada to mýale an order
for the wife after the marriage tie is dissolved. Aiimony, as we understand it, is a
riglit while the maririage tie continues; it
is a penalty imposed on the sinning huaband; -but it does flot continue after the
dissolution of the marriage tie, and the
penalty of znaintenance ia one that this
House in any event bas not souglit to, impose, so far as I know, since the Campbell
case.
There are other riglits, but 1 amrn ot goîng
to dwell on them, that have been reiegated
to the various provincial courts to be administered by them.

I think those courts

are precluded to somne extent. from administerimg them, because once the niarriage
tie is dissolved the relation of husband and
wife ceases, and there la no means I know
o! whereby the court could properly or
legitimately make provision for niaintenance after the divorce is granted. So if the
Senate. or any court to wbom the 1.ower

was aliocated by Parliament, had the riglt
of deaiin& in one suit with ail these questions. there would be but one set of fees
and expenses.
As I said at the outset, honourable gentlemen, I do not intend discussing this matter
at very great length. In the questions
which 1 have addressed to the Government,
you wili observe, I bave had the temerity
to indicate what I venture to tbink miglit
be- the rzolution. 1 ask the Governmen±l

Is there any intention on the part of the
Governmexit to ask from the Imperial Parliament an amendment of the British North
America Act so as to confer on the provincea
the sole jurladiction over marriage antd
divorce?
1 assume that that would necessarily
mean an amendment o! the Britishi North
America Act. .1 arn not alone in rnaking that
that .at a recent meeting
sugg.estion. I know%

of the Canadian Bar Association the comnmittee to whom %vasdeiegated the question
of jurisprudence made a report in which,

among other things, they suggezted that
as a solution.

I ask further:

2. If no such Intention, if the Government
bas considered the proprlety of prescribing
uniform statutory groundz of divorce, leaving
to, the Provincial Courts the procedure to be
followed with the rlght to, exercise ail powers
and grant ail remedies enjoyed by the Probate
and Divorce Division of the -High Court of
Justice In England?

I indicated a moment ago that I thought
it

wvas at least desirable,

assuming, that

there wvas to be a transfer to the provinces
of 'the riglit 1o deal wit.h thi6 question by
clothing their courts wit.h the power, that we
in this Parliament should enact uniform.
grounds o! divorce, applicable ail over
Canada.

The grounds in England are les

wide than ours at the 'present time. You
have recognized that sdultery on the part
o! either the huaband or the wife la a ground
for petitioning for a divorce, wvhen. there
is no condonation or no collusion; but there
are many other grounds, and, as I say, the
report of the committee in England ia that,
so far as the wife is concerned, she should
he placed on an equality %vith the hiusband,

as is the case here in Canada. I think
that is a st-ep in the riglit direction.
I have made a slip. My deszire to be
brie! has led me to malie a wrong statement. I should flot have said that there
are other g-rounds than adultery. Adultery
is a necessary ground, but there are other
things sup)eradded to it in Enzland, wbich
we have flot here in Canada. so far as the
wife is concerned'. Arain, our law is static
under provincial courts, that can or may
soon deal with divorce. We xvant the
advanced leg-isiation, not of anie-confederation days or o! 1870, but o! the present time.
The third question is:
3. If no intention to act under 1 or 2. If the
Government has conqidered the question of
establishing Dominion Divorce Courts?

This Parliament, of course, if it saw fit,
could establish -a court -sucli as the Exchequer Court of the Supreme Court hiaving
jurisdiction throughout, ail Canada; or At
eould T thînk byevond anv doubt, assign

SE NAT E
to the varjous provincial courts, the dut-, of
admriistering, any divorce law whichl this
Parliauîent night see fit to enact.
I think the subject is on1 e of real importance. Men of the higheist standing in
Pýarliaile-n-t have brouglit it Up. At one time
a Prirre Mixiiter introduced a !Bill, and
certain genti enien who afterwards becarn a
mieib-ers of an administration deait with
the question iii the lower House. I know

that 1 arn in -accord with public sentiment
ini asking that this subj,2ct be eonsidered
by Parliament. I think this is the proper
place to bring it up. Some gentlemen hexe
might faolishly take umbrage if the qucstien were hroughlt up in the other House;
and I myseif think that we -are the proper
body to deal with it, ac -%e are the people
to whom Parliament has entrusted this
-%-ery important question.

Honour-

able gentlemen, I congratulate the 'honour-

able member for Moosejaw
(Hon. Mr.

on the very able mnarine r
in which he bias dea]t withi the question of divorce.
I ieel that the members of this House a.re indebted to him for
hringýing it before th-ern. There is no one
who is en-agcd in the! practice of 1aw~, especiallv in the western country, who has flot
had the absolute necessity for a divorce
court in Canada brouglit to his atte2ntion.
It is our experience tirne and again in tbat
part of the country to have applications
made to us on behalf of -a man or a woman
se'eking for a divorce, and we have simply
to teil themn that unless t.hey are able to

put up sufficient monev to bring witnesses
to Ottawa and to enaecounsel thev cannet obtain a divorce in Canada. If they
are unable to do that, ,ve have to tell thein

hie can corne back to Maniiitobzt or SaQkatchewvan and keep his rejzidence in Dakeota, and
after the sixthi month has expired lie procures a divorce.
In this country we have been accustomed
to administering the divorce Iaw in favo-ur
of the ricli and against the poor. ihmere
Hon. Mr. W11LiDVÛHI3Y.

cannot îo an\- question that the poor ;,naii
is absolutely prohibited frorn procuring a
divorce in Canada. He cannot afford to
ernpioy counsel and to bring w'itnesses to

Ottawa. The law should be available to
the poor as well as te the rich. That is
one of the reasonS wliv 1 think, a divorce
court sliou.d be instituted. But that is îîot
ahI; there are other reasons. The honourable meniber for Moosejaw hias gone into
thern pre" ' fully.

It seeni- to mie that this is the proper
stage in the history of Canada to deal with
this que-t'on. Seon a great rnany soldiers
will be returning from the front, nunmiibering
perhaps soine tfhr-e oi- four liundred thousand. Me know that there will be a great
uianv application-- for divorce wvhen these
men return. I arn told that iii some cases
soldiers have beýen married in England or
France, and also in Canada. That is a matter which bas to be settled, and where
can it be zettled better than in the courts
of this country? I have the highest regard
for the Comrnittee on Divorce in this
Senate. Ii is coniposed, I think, of eight
~neniberz: but I arn sure that every one
wilh agree witb mie wlhen I say that a judge,
who bas heenl trained te take evidence, is
just as conmpetent or more competent to
deal wit.hi the mnatter than is a committee of
eiglit mienbers who are changing from time
t a time. Ihen there is -the question of insanitv and other cases -in which, the mnarniage tie înbzfht be dissolv'ed by the courts,
but withi which. tlie Senate does net deal.
I heartihv endorse the statenients and the
argzument- ?e the honourable member frorn

Ls the eame kaw which was in force in Englandl before British Combia came into

it from what has been said here to-day that
honourable gentlemen really want te obtain firet of all a clear decision that the
provinces have the right te 'deal 'with the
question of divorce. I understand that if
the contention now raised with regard te

austained by the judgment of the 'Privy

4uegtion, then, for the provinces which the
courts have decided can deai with divorce
would b. whether it wouid be advisable for
* them to apply tu the Dominion to enact a
law te put the law of Canada on a par
'with tiie law of England as it ia at the

I amn net prepared te express su opinion

]rnow of the. opinions cf the. members of

that the. provinces should b. allowed te

members of the Committee realize thie expense that applicants for diverce especially
those coming from the western provinces,
are Put te-. As has been well said by tho
honourable member frein Winnipeg, that
expense is very conaiderable. I think the
honourable gentleman from 'Moosejaw is te
b. congratulated -on bringing this question
up for discussion, and I hope that we shall
be able te find a solution of it at a later
date.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentilemen, my henourable friend f romn
MooSejaw <Hon. Mr. Willoughby) bas asked
three questions which appear upon the
*O.Tder iPaper. flefore an.swering any of those
questions I may say that, like my honeurable f.riend who -bas just sat down, I have
been in touch with the. work of the Divorce
Committee of the Senate, and I do net think
* there is any deeire on the part of that Cernmittee te assert its authority to exercise the

functions which are from time to time delegated to it by this IChazmber. I have been
on that Committtee coniitin'uoualy sunce 1890,
longer probably than any other member,
and from the firet session down te the
present I- have neyer bail any doubt that
Parliament should -long ago have determined thie question a.long some of the' unes indicated by the honourahle gentleman from
Moosejaw. No «natter what the religious
differences in Oanada rnay be upon t.he
question of divorée, it seems te me that the
method which we have of settaing such cases
The honeurable
la a very unseeffly one.
memuther from Moosejaw bas given very
proper expression to the undesirabllity of
a parliamnentary committee dea-ling with
legal rights in the same inanner air they
would deal with a private Bill for a railway
It
or any other commercial corporation.
seema to me to be inconsistent with the
very seaemn duty which we are called upon
te discharge in dealing with this question,
that we should be Jobbied as to whether we
shail grant or refuse a divorce. Divorce ie
peculiarly a igubject which ehould be desat
with by a judiciai body. I have neyer doubted the desirability of Parliament establishing a court of divorce. I think that would be
the proper method of dealing with this very
important- question, and I amn satisfied that
it is the only mnethod by whichý the matter
can be satisfactorily determined.
The first question* aeked by the honourable gentleman from Moosejaw is this:
la there any Intention on the part of te
Governinent te aak from the Inweriai lýrldament an amendmnent to the British North
America Act so as to confer on the provinces
the sole juriediction over marriage and
divorce?
My answer to that at the present time
would be: No, because the provinces, so far
as I know as a member of the Government,
have neyer in any way indicated. te thisGovýernient or to thýe Parliament of Canada
a deaire te be made chargeablle with dealing
with the question of divorce. If the provinces
had come te the Dominion Governement at
any time ssking that these pewers be given
them, or that the Fede-ral Governinent
should seek te have the British North
Anierica Act amended se as to confer upon
,the provinces jurisdictien in divorce matters, proba:bly action wouJd have been taken
aiong that Uine; but at ne time cati I recal
any movement or even any expression of
sentim~ent cf that kind.
Then my honourable friend asks:
If ncý such Intention, If the Government has
eensidered the proprlety ef prescribing uniforrn
etatutory grounds ot divorce, leaving to the
provincial courts the iirocedure te be followed.

SENATE

with the right to exercise al Powers andl
grant ail reme-dies enjoyed by the Probate
a&nd Divorce Division of the High Cour-t of
Justice In Engis.nd?
I think it is unnecessary to say thst we
could net delegate te the provinces any
jurisdiction in matters of divorce. We might
make use cf the -provincial courts, as we do
in election matters, by constituting thema
Dominion courts; but as provincial courts
we could not clothe thqn with any authority as outlined in the second question.
As te question 3:
if no IntentIon to act under 1 or 2, if the
Governmnent hue consldered the question of
establishing Dominion Divorce Courts?

That question bas never, to my knowledge, received any serious consideration at
the bands of the Dominion Government,
owýing te the fact that public opinion has
neyer apparently been sufflciently concrete
in Parliament ai any time te thrust upon
the Dominion Government the responsibility
of deciding that important issue. I have
no doubt as to the desirability cf doing
something along that lime. As I bave said,
the man!ner witb -which we deal with divorces
to-day la -unseemly. This matter ehould
bedealt witb by a Dominion divorce court,
and un-tii autboefty is given te -the vr6vinoes
by I.mpei'ial legielation. or u!ntii 4tiis Gevernient esiablishes a court cf divorce te
deal with the subjeci, in ibis particular
regard tbe public will not be prcperlY
served. The exercise o! jurisdiction by -the
tb-ree 'western provinces may lead te 60ee
tbing being done in the near future.
My benourable *friend, bas properly said
thai the Court 'of Appeal ini Manitoba
within tbe lasi couple of weeks, I tbink, has
unanimously held that that province bas
jurisdiction in divorce matters. There is a
case now pending as te wbet.ber the prov-inoe ef Alberta bas like jurisdiction. The
decision whicb bas been -made in Manitoba
will be equally applicable te the other western provinces. At the saine trne, a" it relates te those provinces it is net ai ahl
satidfstery, because in the western Provinces, including British Columbia, and I
f ancy in the Maritime Provinces, ati'leasi
in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick-I do
net speak wiib autbority as te ihem-ihe
is entirely governed by the
-jurisdiction
English law as it existed ai the trne it was
introduced into ibese provinces. Consequently they bave ne legislative authority
or jurisdiction te deal witb the subject, nor
can tùey avail- ihemnselves ef the amendmenis te the law whicb have been made in
Great Britain between that date and the
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED-

present time. Those provinces have jixrisdiction in divorce matters iby reason. of the
statute law or the common law ini England
as it might have been ai the time, and netby
reason of their having any initiative. power
to deal with the su-bject by legisiation.
This is, an unsatisfactory condition, and
should -be taken up by the provinces, iso
that they m4y be able to legislate upon
this subject in as full and complete a
manner as they legisiate on any other
eubject, There is no. reason why any province of Canada shouid be tied down to the
law as it existed in Great Britain a generation or more ago. It seema to me that it
is high time the provinces of Canada should
recognize their responib'ilities dn ti
matter; and the disirability, in the public
interest, of taking up this subject, and
discussing. with the Dominicn Government
the propriety of the British North America
Act being eo umended that ithe povinees
cs.n deal f ully and complete]y with the
subject, or urging upon the Dominion
Government the organisation of a divorce
court se that thia subject, which is one of
the mest import.ant intierests, to society,
should be dealt wiih in asfullyand complete
a manner as, any other subject with which
the courts of Canada may deal.
Hon. L. G. POWER: I know that it ls
sligbily outi of order to speak alter the
leader of the House bas answered a question put on the Order Paper, but I wish
simplYto say that ail, the honourable
gentlemen who have spoken up te the
presenut time have been in faveur of
the course suggestied by the honourable
gentieman from Moosejaw (Hon. Mr. Willoughby). Now, I may say that my entimente run iii a totally dîfferent direction.
I think that the efforts of the honourable
gentlemen frem Moosej aw and the thonffuable gentlemuan Item Winnipeg (Eon. Mr.
McMeans), aithough they may net realise
it, were really directed towards rendering
easier the severanoe of the marriage tie.
If we were to establish divorce courts in
Ontario and Quebec I am satisfied that
with.in three or tour years the number of
divorces granted in those provinces would
be quadrupled. I think that is net a deeirs.ble cenemmation. lIn the neighbouring
republic the calculation is that now there
is one divorce for every twelve marriages,
or something less than twelve. I arn sure
these honourable gentlemen who wish to
see a divorce court established are net
anxieus te bring about euch a condition
of -things in Canada, and I arn satisfied that
thp. creation of divorce courts would have

MAYIl 19!-1.
a good dealV of effect in that direction.
Speaking- for the maritime provinces, I
may say that apparently 'the màrriage tie
is not look-ed upon noiv as being as s.scredl
as it was fifty years ago, for the numnber of
divorces grantec ibas increased ver'y materially; in fact, some four or five yea.rs
ago,, I think there were nearly as many
di1
ý'orces granted t-here as were granted hiere
by the Senate.
'Now, ivhat is the position as to divorce
here? The provincial govern.ments or legislatures havie flot as<ked for any change in
the law, or the creation of divorce courts.
and there is no complamnt of the manner
in which the Senate discharges its duty. I
do flot, as a general thing, read the evidence in those7cases; but from what little
I do read, and from what I h-ear, I arn satisfied that there is no better court in the
country than the Senate Divorce Committee.
No one complains of that committee, and
unless there is sornething to show that there
is a strong feeling in favour of a change I
think ive should hiesitate about adopting
any change. That is the way I feel about
it. The question has corne up several times
in this House, and I- can understand that a .
comparatively young iiemiber of -the Senate
who hias not sat on the Divoirce Cornmittee
migýht feel -that it ;vas not the right sort of
court, and that a change should be made.
One point which \vas made by the hionourable gentleman from Winnipeg-, end
whichi is often urged against the Senate's
dea]ingm with divorce, is that the grantin,
of a divorce in the Senate is a costly prooeeding. But any hionourable gentleman
wvho looks 'over the reports of the Divorce
Con-rnittee will find that at the present
time, in the great majority of cases, the
parties a.pplving for divorce are flot rich
people, but are in the hum bler walks of life;and I fancy it does flot cost mucb more
to get a divorce througli Parliament than
it would t.o'get it through a court. There is
the further consideration, that if a party can
show that hie has not the means to pay
* the costs hie cari prosecute his, or her, caQe
in formYa pauperis. and n&>t hiave to pay any
costs at al]. I think we have a pretty good

CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE AND

The Senate again went inta Committee
on Bull Q, an Act ta amend.The Companies
Act in various particulars.-Hon. Sir James
Loug-heed. Hon. Mr. Poirier in the Chair.
On section 2, new section 8-branches:
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT moved:
That on page 1, line 12, the words "or hold
property" be left out and the toilowing words
be inserted in lieu thereof:, "bold, oi, lease.
mortgage or otherwise dispose of property, real1
and personal"-

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Before voting.
an that amendment, I should like ta have
some explaxiatian.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: Perhaps I had
better read the section, with my aniendment included:
(8) The letters patent may provide for the
establishment of a branch or, branches, and
that such branch or branches may own,-

Here are the words I propose ta insert:
hold, oeil, leaae. mortgage or otherwise dispose
of property. real and personal."

The honourable gentleman from De Salaberry (Han. Mr. Béique) has alsa an amendment ta the sanie clause.
Hon. Mr. TAjNNER.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My hanourable friend from, Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt)
apparently is of the opinion that pow«er to,
own or hold property would flot carry with
it the power ta seli. I ar n ot opposing the
amendm-ent, if it is desired ini order ta make
the clause declaratory of what the law is,
but my impression is that the courts have
held that the po>wer ta hold praperty implies the power tai seli1. However, it will
do no. harin tao declare precisely what the
power is.
Hon. FREDERICK NICHOI.LS: Honourable gentlemen, when this Bill was befoare the Comxnittee on the last occasion I
dieYý attention ta the danger af subsection 8,
which enables the parent company ta relieve
itself of any liability contracted by any
branch that may be established, and allows
the branches in their turn ta relieve themselves af any liability that may be in-r
curred. by the parent company. I see that
the honourable memiber for De Sialaberry
(Hon. Mr. Béique,) is introducing an
amendment that ta same extent carrects
that, but, being a layman and flot a lawyer,
I arn doubtful whether it does fully correct
the danger or flot.
Ilan. Mr. BEIQUE: We have flot yet
reached that part of the clause. Wouldthe
honauraible, gentleman wait for a few
minutes?
Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS: My objet, honourable gentlemen, in bringing the matter
up at this stage is this, The honourable
member fran Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Bedcourt)
sep-ksi ta enlarge the pawersi insteact of
restricting t.he-m. 'Therefore, before I can
vote intelligently on -the amend-ruent proposed by tkaat honiarable, gentlemnan, I
would like ta have it understood whether
the po'were are going ta be restrictedý in a
reasonable way by the amendment to, be
mnoved~ by the honourable inember for De
Salaberry.
T he Hon. the OHAIRMAiN: Is it your
pleasure, honourable gentlemen, ta adopt
the ainendment moved by the-honourable
member for Ottawa?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I understand that it
is the desire af the Committee to deal with
the whole sedtion at the same time.
The Hon. the ORMEiMAN: The rest of
the clause amended as proposed by the
honourable gentleman from De Sa.laberry
would read as follows:
And that such property flot derived fromn the
Corporation or paid for out of its owfl moneys
shah flot be subject to the liabilities of the

M-NAY 14. 1918
corporation, and that the corporation shali
flot be subject to the debts or liabilities incurred by such branches; and the corporation
may make by-laws respecting the methdd of
establishing branches and the holding, management and disposition of property by branches.

Hon. Mr. BRIQUE: I do flot see any
objcction to the amendment moved by the
honourable member fromn Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Belcourt). 1 think tha. it improves the
Bill, although I think the honourable leader
of the Government is quite righ*ýt in saying
that it does not add to the powers already
held under the Act. But I would. draw
attention to the amendment which I have
proposed. First of all, we must bear in
mmnd that this part of the Companies Act
refers only to philanthropie or charitable
societies. who have no capital stock and
are dependent upon gifts or subscriptions
from their members. Now, it will be observed that subsection 8 as printed says:
The letters patent may provide for the establishment of a branch or branches, and that

515

ate name whereby it may be distinguished from
the corporation, andi from the other branches,
andi providing that In respect to property owned
or held by such branch or to lis own liabilities,
such branch may sue and be sueti under Ils
separate name, and shall be considered for the
purpose a separate entity.

As I understand it, the objeet of this section of the Bill is te permit a corporation to.
subdivide itself, so to speak, intol branches
and allow each branch to oiwn property. 1
do flot see any objection to that, if machinery is provided in the interest of the creditors as well as the interest of the branches
themselves, whereby each branch shaîl have
the rigaht f0 sue and shall be subject te being
sued in regard to its own liabilitiesl and ifs
own preperty. It seems to, *me that the
-amendment should commend itself te the
judg-menf of this honourable House. I cannet see where the honeurable gentlemar
fromi Toronto (Hon. Mr. Nicholîs) finds that
the amendinent does not cover what is required. Ho.wever, I may be mistaken. Persuch branch or branches may own or hold
haps the honouraible gentleman will exproperty, and that such property shall not be
plain 'where he sees a defect.
subject to the liabilities of the corporation.
Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS: In the first place,
As the clause stands, it permits the -corI believe personally it is a wrong principle

altogaether to allow a corporation te divide
to branches of the corporation. I thought
that it would be, advisable to arnend the itselt into a number of infinifesimal parts

of State can dlaim to have the righlt ef constituting a corporation under the Coinpanies Act without that corporation, beinghiable for ail the debots that mnay be created,
whether by the main body of the corporation or by branches, if the corporation is
allowed to establish branches. I think that
the Secretary of State lias power under the
Companies Act as it was passed in 1917, in
iseuing letters patent, to allow the corporationi thus created to establish distinct
.and separate branches; but hie would net
have the power te relieve the corporation of
liability for the dehts of the branches,
'-poause they form part of the corporation.
Hon. Mr. NICHOLLS: I amn net quite
sure as to the proper procedure, but if I
arn in. order I beg to meve that section 2
be withdrawn.
Hon. Mr. BELGOURT: Anything I have
said cannot be considered as an approval
ef the principle. I had very grave doubt
as te whether we had the right to adopt it
at ahl, and I arn quite prepared te see the
section go; but 1 would not want the Secretary ef State te understand frcm the action
ef this Heuse that we acquiesce in the procedure laid down by him in the memorandum -ývhich my honourable friend hias read.
Surely, if Parliament cannot pass a provision te make section 7A clear and carry it
eut te its legitimate conclu:sion, te use my
honeurable friend's words, I do net think
thc Secretary of State ought te be given te
understand that hie can do it with a clause
whichi requires amiendinent. From the reading ef the memo6randum it would seem that
he considers himself able te do se.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No. 0f
course, the Department ef State may have
its own views upon the construction or
interpretatien, te be placed upon the Coinpanies Act. Thiat we cannot control; but
we certainly can control such legiýsîstion as
xnay he brought down te this House frei
time te time, giving additional powers te
the Cornpanies Act. 1 think we have te let
it go at that. I do net think that section
7A would 'warrant as wide a construction
as lias been soughit te he placed upon it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My observations
are, ef course, prompted by the reading of
the memorandumn.
Section 2 was withdrawn.
On section 3, new section 72-Board et
Directors:
Hon. Mr. B7-1QUF.

Hon. Sir JAMNES LOUGHEED: For the
information of honourable gentlemen I may
nom- repeat the explanation which I made
on the second reading of the Bill. Thiere
have been several representations made te
the departinent that this is unnecessary
provision, as there is good reason for limitin.- the minimum thougli flot the maximum.
One case in point is a drug company.
Under Bome of the provincial Pharmacy
Acta, only quahified pharmacists can control a shop owned by a limited liability
company, and t.he person in control must
ha a direCor of the company. This would
in effect limit the number of shops which
a drug cemnpany may control to fifteen. It
is suggested that this is a business reason
wby the limitation should be removed.
The Departmen-t of Justice concurs in this
view.
Section 3 was; agýreed to.
Section 4 was agreed to.
On section 5-statement in lieu of prospectus:
In
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
taking the amendment of 1917 from the
Eng-lish Act, some verbal inaccuracies crept
into form F, the %vords "memorandum and
articles of association" being left in when
they should have been replaced by letters
patent, euppleinentary letters jpatent or

lion. Sir JAMES LOUGHEEI): I omitted to state-I a_ýîînie(d iliat hiîourable
gentlemen alread v knew-that, this comlmission was constitiîted originally b ' Order in

the War Measures Act. The personnel of
the commission is the selection of the Dominion Governinent, and at the timie the
commission was constituted At %Nas understood that they would secure a local Act
of incorporation and that it should afterwards be confirmed by this Parliamient.
Hence, in a certain sense, it is the
commission of this Governument, as îuuch as it
is the creation of the Nova Scotia Government; and of course it is bv imutual consent that the expenditure and accounts are
euhînitted. te the audit of thi s Gove.rlnent.
Hon. 'Mr. DANDURAND: 0f course, my
honourable friend's
(Hon. Sir J-aiies
Lougheed's) statemient that, this Bill is
brought in with the consent of the provinicial governmnent throws.another lil-ht upon
the subject. Yet there is nething- in the
Bill to Qhowv that, and I contend that when
the Federal Governinent consents to give
its money to a pirovincial crganization, under
a provincial Act, it dil-ests itself of al]
right te control uinless the Federal Governinent stipulates that right of control.
Here is an Act Nvhichi ratifies a provincial Act in w1hich, 1w the second clause,
thle riilbt of control and of audit is claimied;
lent that provincial organization îîîav refuse
te accept that control. W'hat niv lionour-

by this Bill and the whole niatter is placed
in the bande of the commission. As I said
before, I arn sure I voice the unanirnous
sentiments of the people of Halifax in, saying, that Mr. Rogers, the chair-man of that
commission, and J.udge Wallace, who are
both Halifax men, are acceptable and no
better men could be appointed; but the
question of the money expended before the
commission came into existence and took
charge of the aff airs is a matter as to which
the people have some doubts and on which
they would like to have some information.
I desire before taking my eeat to offer
my apologies to some ot the legal gentlemen, who seem to be a littie put out because of references 1 made to themn in a
jocular way. I apologize to them for being
wrong- on this occasion. They are so ofteh
wrong that I thought they were vrong this
time, and the only thing 1 have to say is
that I am glad to find. that they are right on
one occasion anyway, since 1 have been in
this House. My view is that svhen there is
a co-partnership between any province of
Canada and.the Dominion Government, the
Dominion Govern.ment will have the upper
hand-with respect to legisiation or control.
Section 1 was agreed to.
Section 2 wvas agreed. to.
Hon. Mr. BELCOUHT: 1 want to direct
my honourable friend's (Hon. Sir James
Lougheed's) attention to section 27 of the
provincial Act, which provîdes:
No tax, rate or assessment, whether provincial, civic, municipal or otherwise, shall be
rated, levied or assessed upon the Commission,»
or upon or in respect of any property,, real or
personal, of the Commission.

Does it not occur to my honourable f riend
that the commission ought to be exempt
from any Dominion taxation as well? If
so, thien xve ought to provide for that in
the Bill.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They can
be exenipted by Order in Council, under
the War Measures Act.
On the preamble:
Hon. 3,fr. POWER: Mr. Chairanan, when
the. Bill was read the second time I called

attention to t.he fact that there is a mistake in the namne of one of the commissioners. "W'illiam Burnetit Wallace" it is
printed here. It should be William Bernard
WalIlace, as it is in the Nova 6otia Act.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We will

Hon. Mr. POWER: 1 move that the
preamble be *amended by substituting
"Bernard" for "«Burnett."
The amendment was agreed to, and the
preamble as amended was agreed to.
The title was agree-d to.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: As I explained on the second reading, this amendment la made owing to an ambiguity of

I-Ion. W.B BS
presented the second
.cport of the Special Comimittee on the
îiz'nlts- of the Seniate in the maqtters of finiiunciai Iegislati.
He sajd: Honourable gentlemen, in piezenlting tbis report I wislî to mention thiat,

1esides the opinions of Mr. Lafleur and Mi.
Geoffrion, of Montreal, -and Mr. Ewart, of
Ottawa, we requezted also the opinion of
Mr. Hellmuth, of Toronto, on this subject,

of thisHou'e, t0 learn that hundreds of
ilienl Were eiploved on the construction of
the Hudson Bay- railway last summer.- I
(Io not helieu-e that inany honourable nietnbers of this: fouse 'would ackznowledge that
tliat enterprise tvas one of very great
nizîcespecially in view' of the plans
%vhîicli the bonourable leader of the flouse
brou2lit down last session in answer to an
inquiry of mine, showing- the hundîeds of
miles of rails that were being torn up on
rai:roads flhen i opera-tion in order that
:lîe rails miglit ho sen-t to the front. Wflien
n e renieniber iliat we were dismantling railways, how is it possible that at the very

saine time we were actually laying rails,
and, forsooth, for what? To build a railroad te the Polar sea. There is a vast

SENATE

526

diversity of opinion as to the desirability of
this road, but 1 de net think that anyone
in this honourable House believes that the
building of it is a matter cf urgency at
present. Last year the Minister of Railways said that ninety-two miles cf rail
would be laid during last sur-nmer on this
railroad, and I inquired where those rails
would be procured in view cf the fact that
the Governrnent of Canada could net procure rails to send to the front, and had to
take up rails frorn railroads already in
eperation. The answer given to me was
that it was not in the publie interest te
tel] where the rails carne frcrn, and, le a.nd
beheld, while rails were being tomn up on
the Transcontinental and on the Canadian
INorthexn wvest cf Edmonton, and were heing
hauled dowvn te Halifax Wo be shipped te
Europe at a cost cf ýthirty dollars a ton for
the freight besidee -the prie cf4 the
rails, at the saine timne the Government
was buying rails in Pittsburg 'which were
being haule-d to the Hudson Bay railway,
and which crossed the rails from west cf
Edmonton which 'were in transit to Europe.
I believe that there has been an oversight
on the part of the Governrnent. Surely
there 'was neyer any intention ef takzing rails
fren 'west of Edmaonton and sending them
te the Atlantic coast, and at the sanie tume
buying rails in Pitts4ýburg to send to the
Hudson bay. The rails 'which were rernoved 'will have Wobe, replaced so-me tirne.
Would it not have been better te have let
have
theni rernain -where they were, and Wo
let the Hudson Bay raîlrway wait?
I said that there was no urgency for the
bouilding of this road. Well, what is the
excuse for rushing it through? Ail of us
who are acquainted with Port Nelson know
that there is ne harbour there, no0 wharves,
no elevators, nothing Wo ship from; and
there is no local trafflc likely to ariée between Le Pas and Port Nelson. Then, 'why
spend the money at this cf aIl imes? Why
spend it at the very rnornent when everyone is said te -be 'wanted at the front or on
the farms or in munition factories? When
aIl the labour available is required, why
build a railroad sncb as this and ernploy
hundreds of men in doing it? If the Gevernment ivere to tell us that the terminaIs
were ready and tihat qsomcthing might be
aceompliehed, we could 8ee soine reaeon
for this, work going, on; bout nothing bas
been donc, and everyene knows -that i't will
take as niucb inoney te make a decent port
at Port Nelson as has -been. spenit on the
barbour at Montreal ever since it existed,
and then 'when the port is built it ids doubtHon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

fuI wvhether it will be (>f any com-mercial
value. In these dayis we are told that we
sheuld be eco&nomical. Economny is the great
cry. Where is the economy in 'building- a
railroad at the present time when the price
of materials is wo nuch more t.han what
it was? The price of rails is 250 per cent
higher than it ueed, to 'be, and the price of
labour i6 perhaps twice as inuch as usual.
Therefore the fixed charges of this railway, even if it were going to be of any use,
would ibe enough to kill the project. It
would neyer pay the fixed charges. I amn
informed that rails are now $70 a ton, and
we k-now that a few years ago we could
buy theni fren the United States Steel
Corporation for $26 a ton. We are spending two dollars in order to get the value of
one dollar in normal times, and the overhead charges of that railroad would be
doubled, and a double f are would have te
be charged for it to corne even, if it did
get traffic. 1 do flot think anyone 'will deny
that w-e want labour on the fa.rrns of this
country. Only yesterday a large nurnber of farmners carne here saying that they
could net incréase production if we took
away the nien to eend thein to the front?
How is it. that we ean -take therni te build
the Hudson Bay railway? 1 believe that
honourable gentlernen are surprie7ed at the
amount -of work that lias been going on on
this railway within the least twelve months.
This is net a pelitical question; far ,from
it. If there is any blarne to be attached,
the prirnarv blarne would attach to the
party that I used to belong to be!ore I carne
into this House.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Oh. oh.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Used to?
Hon. Mr. BOYER: He bas jeined the
Union Governinent.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: There is no deubt
that there s'as a great demand for this
railway in the past. Our good friends in
the West would like to have the earth with
a fence around it. They have been clarnouring for this railway regardless of expense
or expediency frorn a commnercial point o&
view.
The first thing was te have surveye made,
and, as usual, the engineers reperted that
it would be an easy line Wobuild. But the
railread bas proved to be as expensive, if
net more expensive, than any other road.
In my opinion this honourable House
should express its, disapproval. of this work
continuing at present, and perhaps they
will bear with me for a few mornents while

MAY 15, 1918
I inform them of the nature of the r6ute.
A session or twn ago 1 .placed .upon the
table of the House a plan of Port Nelson,
showing that there is no water within a
-mile or a mile and a half of the place where
the docks were to be erected andi the
elevators put. Again, officiai figures given
in this House some sessions ago show that
at a distance of sixteen miles out from the
.shore
'there is only seventeen feet of water.
Consequently a channel would have to be
dredged ahl the way from Port Nelson~ to
that point. Then, it must be reniembered
that the silt has been coming down the
Nelson river for centuries, and there is no
guarantee whatever that after the excavation has been made it will not be necessary
to keep dredges in constant attendance to
prevent the -sit from filling up the channel.
The silt is isolt mud, aud there would be
nothing to hold up the sides of the channel.
You might as well try to make a hole in a
barrel of peas as to try to make an outlet
at the mouth of the Nelson river.
As everyone knows, t.he cliniate of Port
Nelson is a severe one. Some who have
wintered there say that the thermometer
drops to 60 degrees below zero on many
occasions, and that agriculture is nlot possible within a contour line about M0miles
distant from -the
shore of Hudson bay.
From Le Pas for a distance of 250 miles
there may be a few smail patches where
there is so alluvial soul, but nothing has
been grown to the extreme north. Le Pas
seems to be the north end o! the fertile
belt of the Northwest, so there is nothing
to develop but the route itse]f.
WVhat is the route? You cannot judge by
latitudes, as they are very deceptive. The
isothermal line is the real criterion. For
instance, Quebec and Ment-one are in about
the same latitude, but no oe would compare the clîmates of the two places. Port
Nelson is one of the coldest places on earth
in that latitude. We aIl know that Edmenton is north of Port Nelson; but the
climates of the two places are nlot to be
compared, because the isothermal line inclines vsry much to the north in the region
of Edmonton. Port Nelson is something
like Greenland, and not the southern part
of Greenland at that-they have snowstorms in August; they have snow-storms
in June.
If this route -were commercially practicable it might be different, but what are
the facts? In Hudson bay itself navigation
may be possible for three months or so
during the year; but you must remember
-that in the Hudson straits, %vhichare sonie

527

550 miles in length, the current changes
four tines a day and lu some places
run.s at the rate of nine knots an hour.
The current changes on the surface a couple
of hours before it changes underneath, and
huge icebergs called growlers, some of them
drawing three or four hundred feet of water,
are caught in this nine-knot current, going,
say, toward the east, whilst the surface
ice may be running in the opposite direction. They crash together with a speed
o! several knots an hour, and the noise
can be heard for miles. Woe to the ship
that is caught in the surface ice when one
of these growlers is approachingi AIl the
ships can do is to try to get into what they
caîl sof t ice or fioe ice. Tfhe old ice is
as hard as rock. Commander Wakeham,
in W~s report to thé Government, stated
that his ship, -the Adventure, was made
saucer-shaped, round on the bottom, so that
when the lateral pressure of the ice camne,
the ship was lifted. She was not built at
aIl like a modemn ship, and was bult so
that she would b e lifted bodily out of the
water and would rest on the ice. In the
same report he says, as honaurable' gentlemen can read, that the rudder of the ship.
which was constructed of solid oak and
was fourteen inches thick, was snapped off
like a pipe-stem. When t.he pressure of ice
had subsidsd, the ship would reeume its
place in the water. Where such conditions
exiet that is no place for navigation. You
may -say that is early in the spring or late
in the faîl. Not at ah. The first entrance
that Commander Wakeham could make was
on July 15. He always started early sud
waited at the mouth of the straits until he
saw a lead to go in. On one occasion he
had on board an officer o! the Royal Northwest Mounted Police, who was in charge
and could order what the ship was to do.
This man said, "'You can go in now." He
went in and got caught in the ice, and lie
regretted -fhat lie had not - waited longer
before entering the straite. The strait-g are
mnost difficult, for navig ation.- Frein a conrmercial point o! view it is just as the honourable senator froin De la Durantaye i(Hon.
Mr. Tessier) said the other day, when he
wanted to kno.w whether it would not be
possible te adjust the insurance for the
St. Lawrence route so as to have the rate
te Mont-real the same as the rate to New
York, Portland, Boston, or any other port
on the Atlantic oeean. But if the marine
ineurance rates on the St. Lawrence are
prohibitive in certain seamons of the year,
what would they be in these M5 miles of
straits? The insurance alone would be pro-

such progress has been made, nor bas lie
slioirn a desire to obtain what I might cali
concrete information. The object cf hie
motion is rather, I preui-me, to afford him
an opportunity of uttering those dismal pro.
phecies wh.ich we have listened to for a
great many yeari.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: YÉou are a mind
reader.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I fancy
that when the Hudson bay route cornes to
be operated, and je demonstrated to be one
of our most, successful transportation systeme, we shail be able to look -back upon
the Prophecies w1hich our Jeremiali friend
bas made, extending, 1 know, for the last
seven or eight years, dexiouncing in every
conceivable way the practicability of this
route.
My honourable friend lias neyer shown
any desire to acquaint himself with the
actual facts concerning either the progreas
'which bas been rnade upon the road or tlie
practicability of the scherne. If my lion.
ourable f.riend analysed tlie aituation more
closely, such an analysis would deprive him
of the opportunity 'which lie lias taken on
90 ZnanY occaei<rns of denouncing this project in the 'wlolesale rnanner in wliich lie
bias doue.
Permit mne to say that no construction
upon the Toad proper bas been made for
a year. A bridge lias been cornpleted over
the* second crossing of the Nelson river.
No rails have been laid for over twelve
months. Three liundred and thirty-two
miles ot road have been completed; 90 miles,
or, to be exact, 92 mriles, yet remain. to be
completed. Of the =3 -miles of the road-bed
on which rails have been* laid, 214 miles
have been operated, part of that distance
semi-inonthly, and part muchi more frequen4ly, in facit coutinuously every day, J[
understand. Over 100 miles of that road
have been self-sustaining for the period,
during which. it bas been operated, and the
214 miles, during the period that that section has been operated, have been self-sustaining.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I do -not want to
interrupt the honourable gentleman, but
may I ask him who is operating the road?
'hon. SirJAMES LOUGHEED: The contractors; bet-weeu thu(- contractors and the
Government the railway is being operated.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: And it is self-sustainingP It is carrying materials for the
building of the road.
Hon.

Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:
It ise
carrying the products of that northern country to the markets cf thle West, and je cf
very.gxeat advantage to the people of theWest. I have no- doubt that when that road
is completed, as completed it will be, it
will be found of inestimable advantage to
the development of that western country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would tlie honoura.ble gentleman inform the House as to
the number of miles already settled, frorn
Le Pas northward?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I cannot
tell rny honourable friend what the settlement le, but I amn inforrned iby the chief
engineer of the Bailway Department, wlio is
charged with carryiug ont of this work, that
the road rus through a very fertile district, and were it not for the rigours of the
climate, it would be settled from Le Pas
te the Bay. I have no doubt that in tirne
there will lie a. prosperous settiement along
the whole of that road and- theit the district will be not -merely self-mustaining, but
one of the moat productive districts of the
West.
Now, as to ithe statements which have
been 'made by the honourable gqntlernan
(Hon. Mx. (Casgrain) es to-the uon-navigability of the otaite, permit>ame Ie say *ilie4,
so far as the carniage of materials le concerned, construction work lias net been proceeded wlth serieusly since 1914, but in
that year no lese than 36 passages througli
the straits, through the bay, and tlirough
the estuary were successfully made, over
20.000 -tons of freight for the construction
of that read being cs.rried. The ships which
navigated the straits were net built for the
ice traffic; they were sixnply tramp steamers without any special constructive features
for this particular navigation; yet during
that year 'those Bhips, not at all adapted
for the navigation of the waters in that
Hudson straits, made ne less thau 36 passages. It seems to me that should be unatiswerable evidence of this fa.ct, that when
ships are specially constructed for the
purpose, there will b. no question as to the
navigability of the straits during t.he season
which bas been conceded to be the limitation, so to speak, for xipvigation in those
waters, namely, the monmihs of August,
Septernber and October, and it is altogether
likely tliat they rnay be open for navigation
during part o! July and also part o!
Noiember. The information in the Department of Railways is such as to warrant the
Gioverument in concluding that during the

From Medicine Rat te ,Montreal, 2,082

Hon. Mr. CASIGRAIN: WiI.l the honourable gentleman pardon me? I1 was speaking of the distance te the head. of the lakes.
If the honeurable gentleman gave thé distance te the head of the lakes, he would
correborate my statement.
H-on. Mr. SCHAFFNER: I arn speaking

I do neot prefess te have the necessary

Hon. Mr. POIRIER: May I add just
a wvord? 1 believe the distance fromi Port
Nelson to Liverpool is practically the saine
as froin New York, to Liverpool. There is
a difference of orily a few miles.
Honl. Mfr. SOHAFF!N'ER: The lionoura hie
gentlema n from De Lanaudière (Hoin. Mr.

of the season of navigation in Hudson
bay and straits. ln 1908 1 took the figures

SENATE
Hon. Mr. WATS ON: Accord.ing Vo the
honoura;ble gentleman froin Montreal (Hou.
Mr. Casgrain). There is no doubt that the
trouble is in the straits, because Hudson
bay i*san open inland sea. The straits are
about 60 miles in width and about 400
miles in length, and there is no obstruction
excepting oecasional ice. lIt is not claimed
that more than about one-third or onequarter of the strait is covered with ice,
which drifts back and forth, and iby means
of an inivention. of coinparatively recent
years 'that diifficulty ean, be overeome. Wireless telegraphic station6 could be established
which would let the sh-ips know where the
ice was and what part of the channel was
free so that they could pass through.*
My honourable friend has spoken of the
nature -of the country ak>ng the 'Uine of the
Hudeon Bay railway. If he, will look in the
library he will find a report prepared and
.ubmitted to this House by the late Ho;n.
Thomas Davis, of Prince Albert, which
states that the territory north of Le Pas is
capable of maintaining a large population.
My honourable friend. smiles. He has not
beeqn there, nor have I; but I judge that
the character of! the country is as stated
in the report. We know that very valuable minerals, gold and silver among othera.
have been discovered, and that mines have
been established and immense amounts of
capital invested. What would have bar)peiied north of Cobalt if it had not been
for the action of the Ontario Government
in building railroads? The chances are that
tfie silver fields of Cobalt would flot have
beén discovered.
I agree with honourable gentlemen th-it
th, Government should go slow in spendimg rnoney at Port Nelson. 1V is seventy.
five miles nearer to Le Pas than Fort
Churchill; but in my opinion Fort Churchill
is the better spot for the terminus o! this
railway. The description o! Port Nelson as
given by the honourable gentleman, accordinga Vo ail the information I have, is absolutely correct.
As I have already said, no investment
by the Government of Canada liaà received
more consideration than the Hudson Bay
railway. Since my eleotion in -1882 'up rto
the present time I have known of no candidate for Parliament in Manitoba, Alberta
or Saskatchewan, who did noV advocate the
building of -the fHudson Bay railway. It
may be that in the early days we were
driven to it on account of the monopoly
o! the C.anadiian Pacific railway; but even
dowýn to the present time the members o!
Hon. Mr. CROQUETTE.

Parliament from the different constituencies
in Vhcse provinces have ail advocated the
building of the Huds9on Bay railway, and
if any nian 'wants a cheer, all lie has to do
is Vo talk about it.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: IV was a f ad.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Yes, a fad, and a
necessafry fad, if you put it that way.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Tell us about the
grain.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: My honourable
friend speaks of storing grain. There îs
quite a quantity of grain hild n>ww
bef oie it is shipped Vo Liverpool by the
route in which lie is interested. That may
not be the case Vhs year; but as a rule a
large qua'ntity of wheat is, in storage at
Fort William jor ten mon'ths after it is
-grown.
Hon. Mr. SOHAFFNER: About one-third
of it.
-Hon. Mr. WATSON: I would noV say onethird, but a large quantity. It would not
be theld, ay longer by reason of its gK>Ïng by
the Hudson Bay route. These things will
adjust Vhemselves. -My honourable friend
knowvs that iV is only a very few years
since the St. Lawrence route was declared
dangerous, and it was said that At could
neyer be navigated. My honourable frîend,
as a navigator, will probably agree that
the ice difficulty can be overcome if wireless stations are established as I have sugg-ested. Navigation in the Hudeon bay is
open, I suppose, eight months in the year,
probably as long as at Port Arthur or Fort
William.
We .have an annual discussion by my
fionourable friend of this inatter. I VIi.nk
is

advice -ie correct in some things, but

when lie knocks the projeet generally 1
think lie is wasting his time, because lie
will neyer convince the people o! the West
that lie is riglit; and Vhey are going Voi
have
something toý say, not only now, but in. the
future, as Vo how money is going Vo be
spent. I join my honourable friend in suggesting to, the Government that they should
noV spend very much mnoney un the Vernrinai-s at tdie present time, because I th.ink
their own reports show grave doubts as Vo
Vhe advisabiiity of making Port Nelson the
terminus o! hils line.
Hon. GEO. GORDON:
Honourable gentlemen, it appears Vo me fiat -the honourable gentleman who raised Vis question
was looking at ahI the diamal aspects o!

MAY 15,1918

MAY
this particular undertaking, and in doing
so dfai1ed to look at one of the Ibright prospects-the mining leature. For his own
information, I would advise him to look
into that question. He would find that a
certain company bas already discovered a
field of suiphite which is raid to be about 300
feet wide and over 2,000 feet long. They
have diamond-drilled very extensively and
have satisfied themselves that there is at
least 3,000,000 tons of sulphite there. It is
said that in normal times suiphite ores are
worth at least $10 per ton; therefore I conclude, and I think my honourable friend
will too, if he looks more clo8ely into tbat
aspect of the question, that an immense
industry will be developed in that part of
the country. Apart from ihis particular
industry, it would seem th-at a great gold..
mining area la going to be developed there.
A very large part of the country has been
gone over -and, prospected, and, if the bhonourable gentleman is sufflciently interested,
I think he will find that the tonnage to be
derived from the mines and which will be
carried by that road will 'be quite considerable.
If it were not for the mining feature, I
would be incl'ined to sympathize with the
henourable gentleinan, because, without
that, I would neyer have thought that tii
undertaking should have been gone on
with; but now it is my firm opinion that it
will develop in somewhat the same way as
the Temiskamingc and Northern Ontario
railway developed, and I believe it will turn
out to be a profitable venture.
B.
Hon. W%. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
g"entlýenan. before the discussion closce I
want to say only a fexv w-.ds. Like the
honourahie gentleman from Manitoba (Hon.
Mr. S''chaffner), RIw.ar in no way prepared
to find that the in.noe.ent-looking iiiquiry on
the Order Paper would lead to an eloquent
attack on the policy of the Hudson Bay
railway. Had the honourable gentleman
(Hon. Mr. Casgrain) indicated that such
w-as his purpose, we from Saskatchewan,
however poor and inadequate our efforts
might have been, would have attempted to
defend it. Saskatchewan, more than, any
other province, is interested in the building
of this road. Manitoba also is interested,
but not so vitally, because it lies nearer to
the Great Laites, than does Saskatchewan.
Alberta on the west bas the alternative
route of the P-anama canal.
The policy of the 'Government is. 6o
ably charnpioned by the leader of the Government, the honourable member for

Boissevaîn (Hon. Mr. Sehaffner), and 4,he
honjourable gentleman from Portage -la

not say a word as to the propriety of the
undertaking; but, if the honcurable gentleman who bas launched the inquiry to-day
wishes a full dtiscussion on the -subjeet, asay
at another session of this House, and will
put a motion on the Order Paper condemning the building of the road, or will bring
it properly before the House so that we may
know of it beforehand, I shall attempt,
however inadequately. to deal with the

THE CASE 0F CHARLES DESJARDINS.
MOTION.

Hon. Mr. DAVID moved:
This House regrets that, in the case of the
Crown versub Charles Desjardins et al, the
Government has thought proper te furnish part
of the bail reauired to restore to liberty the
-said Charles Desjardins and to engage lawyera
for his defence.

He said: My object is to have an expression of opinion by this House, because
the action of the Government in this
case affects to a great extent the good administration of justice in this country, and
1 think that if the members of this House
listen to the facts which will be put before
them. they will be convinced that this matter deserves their consideration, and I am
sat.isfled that they wilh be in sympathy with
the motion which I propose.
When the men who were accused of having conspired to commit xnurder, to destroy
property, and to perpetrate ail kinds ai
outrages, were, brought Up in couxrt

1 wilI read oinly a few paragraplis, of t1he
judgiîiient w.îcîlia gave on tibe preliniiinar «y investigation. It is in French, but
1 will translate it as well as 1 can:
The disposition show that for a certain
trn'e
individuals had been in the habit of meeting,
and at their meetings it was proposed to commit
abominable offeuces-to steal dynamite, ta seize
firearma, to rob banks, snd to bIow up various
welI-known establishments in Montreal. Amiong
those individuals the depositions naine particularly Lalumiére, Handfield, Monette and DesJardins. Mlr. Desjardins w's einployed by Mi'
Honoré Gîroux, Dominion Police Inspecter, ta
fOllowý the deliberations of those individuals.
-Aýccording to the evidence of Giroux, Des.jardins mnade reports frequently, if not daily,
as to what was going on, and It la shown by
the depositions that Desjardins bad succeeded
In gaining the confidence of the persons thus
assembling, and wvas a inember of their secret
committee. These reports by Desjardins, wbich
he sent to Inspector Giroux, were transmlitted
by the latter bo Sir Ferry Sherwood.

ThÉe conclusion is t hat tlie Governient

il ta ba an ainost coiipiate admiission timat he

reai)onsilJility as good law, whatever nay be

Has Desjardins (going outside of bis duties
ani forgetting bis duties> advised, helped and
counselled any of these crimes? In other words,
hss lie participated in tbc preparation 0f tbese
outrages? That la the point. And bere Desjardins, instead of being supported by 'Mr. Giroux.

stands alone. He stands before you witb a great

deal of assurance and confidence and tells you
in a very solern Nay: "AIl tbese peoffle were
perjurers; I alone arn telling the trutb." That la
the position whicb lie takes.
He bas forgotten the one tbing-tbat hie himself has corroborated nsost of tbe tbings about

Nvould be a perjurer; but it is not fer me tu

Desjardins, who knows ail that, goes to this

Sir Perc 'v Slieiwood m-as flot brouglit to

tù say that lie liad isot participated iu any

Judge Pelletier says:
not aIl the mioney wbicb Desjardins
ý;T is
gave. He gave to enty -five dollars, bie aiso gave
tbe one dollar, and again bie gave anotber dollar
and a baîf. He gave the dollar and a haîf te
a man by the name of Desautels, and tbe purPose of Desautels ivas te steal dynamite at
Beloeil. What word did he use in one of bis
reports? In tbia report bie said that tbere wvas
a purpose of stealing dynamite at Belceil. Now'
under oath bere bie a.dnhits baving given the

dollar and a haif to the mný,1 110

going
t0 Beloeil. There again I find fault, and serjous
fault, against Desjardins, because this is the
third time bie bas given money for unlawful
purposes.

Tiiis is contrary to the deelaration made
vbthe hionourable leader of the House, Who,
in hue ordinary interpretation of his words,
teliz us that, Desjardins hiad done whiat he
hacl a righlt to do. And inow about the outrage at Three 'Rivers Judge Pelletie-r tells
the jury:
This unspeakable outrage to be perpetrated
at Three Rivers had been spoken of and %vas
Partialiy arranged on the twenty-seveflth of
July. The month of July bas thity-0ue cdays.
Desjardins says that hie went Up t0 Ottaw a onl
the twenty-eighth of July, that hie saw Sir
Percy Sherwood, and that hie mientioned te hlm
wh-at wvas in his returro, and what was flot. Now,
In his return hie mentions clearly Ibis Three
Itivers plot, and hie says hie also told Sir Perey

Sberwood about It. That la what hie said. Therefore Sir Perey Sheerwood kne%- that (if this
man tells the truth) un the twenty-eigbtb.
What did they do on thse tw'enty-eightb about
it? What did they do on the twen'ty-ninth?
Whatt did tbey do on the thirtieth? What did
they do on the thirty-first? What did tbey do
on the first, second and tisird of August about
it? (Snapplng bis fingers) Not. that. Do you

tbink that If il was true that Desjardins went
Up to Ottawa at ail, and told Sir Perey Sher-

wood about Ibis. that Sir Perey Sherwood would

ha-e given six days t0 these dynamiters te blow
up the Bank and set fire to the city of Three
Rivers? I don't believe It. If hie dld lie rnissed
bis duty sadly.
I think I have given enoug-h to enable
every hionourable gentleman to put this
que-sion: in view of the judgnient given by
Judze St. ('yr, wlio pres-idfd at the pre-

limiinry investig-ation, and of the charge
t.l te j ury hv Judze Pelletier. can the Goerimeit he considered to have acted proI)cirly in taking- such a respolisibility aýs
furnfishing b-ail for Desjardins, when t1reoy
could not ignore what had takzen pl-lce, or
ithe suspicion cré,ated by the crinieý coiniitteà hv thosze dynaniiterý:
The conduct of the Governmneît xvas of
ýucls a nature as to, confirrn the conviction
tlhat exîsted at the tinie. It was a tine of exc:&'nand the belief of the people -was
thai Desjardins had been engaged by the
Governiment, or by gentlemen representing
the Government, in order to incite those

T)ersons to commit crime and to show that
the anti-conscriptionists, especially the
French Canadians, were aIl crimiinals aud
wvould commit any crime. 1 do flot say,
honourable gentlemen, that it was true; 1
sav that that wvas t1heir opinion, snd I say
that the conduct of the Governiment naturallv lent colour to their conviction. 1 sýay that
thie responsibility o! the Governnment -%as

538

SENATE

clearly established and that the Govern.
ment or the Minister of Justice had only
one way to remove that responsibility, and
that was ta repudiate the actions ai Desjardins, of Giroux and of Sir Percv Sherwood, or in any event ta show that they bad
nothing ta do with the aff air. They have
nat done sa. On the contrary, when the
question was brougblt up, the hanourable
leader of the House spoke in such a way
a,. ta make us believe that he could flot condemn the deeds committed by Desjardins,
who had done what he was authorized to do.
Now, honourable gentlemen, who is directly responsible? Desjardins -vas employed by Giroux, a member of the Fedeiral
Police, and 'Mr. Giroux ihad- relations with
Sir Percy Sherwood. Desjardins was evýdently acting under the authority of Giroux
and of Sir Percy Sherwood. It is naw
proved that the bail was furnisbed by the
Deputy Minister af Justice. Between Desjardins and Giroux the distance is short;
between Giroux and Sherwood the distance
is short; and between Sherwood and the
Deputy Minister of Justice the distance is
stili 5horter. There is on-ly one mare step
ai the ladder. I do not say that the Minister ai Justice is directly responsible, but
Up ta the present he bas done natbing to
disprove bis responsibility. At ahl events,
the Minister ai Justice is responsible for
the doings af his emplayees unless he repudiates their actions, and, I repeat, he
has flot done sa.
In conclusion, honourable gentlemen, I
say that the bonourable leader ai the Government and the hanourable Minister ai
Justice should not remain under a cloud;
they ought ta justify thenmelves. 1 do not
think there is another country in the world
where a avernment or a minister ai justice,
being under such suspicion, would not .tbink
it necessary ta make an investigation in order ta ascertain wbo is really respansible.
If there is one institutian which is sacred
and entitled ta the respect ai the people,
it is -the administration ai justice, and anything wbicb may decrease or affect the confidence which the people have in the administration af justice is dangerous, even
fatal, td the best interests ai the morality
ai a country. A country in which justice
is demaralized is a demoralized country.
I hope that honourable gentlemen or. bath
sides ai this House wiIl express their views
on the question. At any rate, 1 desire ta
have the vote on my motion recarded.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, the motion which bas
been made by my honouirable iriend iram
Han. Mr. DAVID.

Mille LIes (Hon. Mr. David) iis a rather
peculiar illustreation af tihe vagairies of
human intelligence in dealîng witb exceptional situations. A Dominion law known
as the Military Service Act was pa6sed,
and the enfo>rcemento t w.as received with
oi
sigans of disapproval and lawlessness on
the part of certain sections af tbe cammiunity in the province ta which my honourab.le friend belonga. A gang ai lawless
individuals was apparently conspiring ta
perpetrate acts ai lawles6sness and outrages
whicb migbt well have startled any community. The attention oi the Dominion
Government being directed ta these facts,
it was iound flot merely desirable, but absolut-ely necessary, -ta suppress sucb aots as
migbt be contemplated by the partîcular
gang ta wbicb 1 allude. RfiI am incorrect
in my statement ai tbe iact, I hope my
bonourable friend will correct me, mnasmuch as be bas broùght Up this matter
prematurely. I did mot anticipate it would
be discussed before ta-mnorrow; therefore I

having acted.
Hon. Mr. DAVID:
If the honourable
gentleman (Hon. Sir Jameé; Lougheed) will
Zllow me, 1 may say that no crimes had
been committed at tbe time Desjardins was
enguaged.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It was
weIl known ta the Government that certain
crimes were contemplated and that steps
were being taken by this particular group
ai lawless men for the purpose ai committing those crimes at an early day.
Hon. Mr. OHOQUETTE: WilI the bonourable gentleman allow me one suggestion?
Hon. Bir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
~Hon. Mr. CHOQUEI'TE. The honourable
gentleman lias just said that he is nlot

MAY 15, 1918
upon the staternent of facts whichi he has
made. But I know that the honourable
gentleman, having sat for many years with
Mr. Justice Pelletier, has full confidence in
that gentleman's judgment and honour and
knowledge of law, and would be disposed to
take his staternents as the presiding judge
at a jury trial as properly setting forth the
facts. Now, what do we find the facts to
be, as stated by both Judge St. Cyr and
Mr. Ju-stice Pelletier? The facts are to this
efiect: tihat Giroux wa-s employed by the
Dominion Police, and very pro<perly, as
detective for the purpose of finding out
whether any evil-doing people had in mind
the commission of any crime; that Giroux
employed Desjardins, which was also a
very commenidable thing on the part of
those officiais and on the part of the Department of Justice aiid of the Governrnent
to authorize. We do not find any fault
with that; it was the duty of the Department of Justice to employ detectives under
the circuinstances. and it was the duty of
those detectives, Desjardins and Giroux, to
ingratiate thernselves wjth those people for
the purpose of finding out what they were
proposing to do. We do flot complain of
that; we commend the Government for
dsoing thüt. But where we do not coinmend the Governrnent is in taking the responsibility, before the people of this
country, for acts which were comrnitted by
Desjardîns, and, which I arn going to state,
and state fully, but in very few words. I
take them from the charge of Mr. Justice
Pelletier. The first thing that Desjardins
did was to advise the commission of the
crirne-to suggeist the robbing of the banks
in Three Rivers, and, -the Setting of 6ires

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But the

Hon. Mr. CLORA.N: The judg?e would not

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I did not follow the
trial, but 1 think I arn justified in taking
the charge of the judge as stating the facts
as proved before him, and stating the facts
as given by Mr. Justice Pelletier.

Hon. Mrr. GIRROIR: The honourable

-Hon. Mr. HEIQUE: There were half-adozen men, and of course it was only those

that; there was no denial on the part of
Desjardins that hie had paid the $25.
'Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: No, but hie denied
that hie incited those men to commit any
crime.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: They hadn't any
money.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: -I arn stating facts.
I did not follow t.he trial, but I think I arn
warranted in taking the charge of one judge
and the judgment of another. There are
two judges. Judge St. Cyr, et t;he prelimin*ary investiigation,, dad heard the evidence and ordered the arreelt of some of
ithose people, especially Desjardins, and
gave bis reason for it, and referred to the
evidence which had been adduced before
him. Then I arn takzing as my authority
the charge of the Hon. Judge Pelletier, who
is a man of hig-h standing, a judge of the
Court of Appeal, the highesit eourt in our

REvISED EDITION

SENATE

516

Section 1, amending section 211 of the
Criminal Code, is for the purpose of raisin- the age of consent. It covers cases of
seduction of girls between the ages of 16
and 18. At present the law applies ta girls
from 14 ta 16 years of age, who will be protected by.section 301 of the Code, as amended by section 3 of this Bill.
.At the present time the offence deaIt wi'th
in section 2 of the BilH is confine-d ta girls
employed in factories, milis, 'workshops or
stores. The amenduient proposes ta extend
this provision ta girls in any employment.
The provision is added that proof of previaus illicit connectian with the accused is
flot ta be d-eemed ta be evidence that the
girl was flot previausly chaste. This is ta
prevent a man from urging that the girl wvas
flot chaste because'he had previously had
relations with her, which of course is no
real defence. This section withaut the addition was in the Bill of 1913, which was
thrown out by the Senate.
Section 3 takes the place ai aid section
211, leaving out the provision that the girl
must have been ai previously chaste character, and adding the provision, '«and
whether he believes her ta be above the age
of sixteen veaxs or not."
Thse new section 220A, added by section
4 of the Bill, is intended ta prevent a man
and a woman from registermng at a hotel or
lodging house as man and wii e when they
are not 50 in reality. It has been suggested
that this clause should be modified ta
prevent ýprosecution an the ground tlfat
marriage or divorce was flot valid. I believe
that the honourable gentleman frain Baissevain (Hon. Mr. Schaffner) ha6 an amendment for that purpose. 'The provision
contained in -the proposed new section
220B arase aut ai a case where a man was
living in adu.ltery with a soldier's wite and
corsupting the soldier's children; and
among some classes euch cases are unfortunately tao common. Subsection 4 of the
proposed new section 22B prevents prose,cutians fram being impraperly brought, as
they cannat be instituted by any private
persan.
Sections 5,_ 7 and 8 deal with g-ambling
dens which. are supported by a rake-of!
I believe the evil of gamfrom the game.
bling dens is particularly prevalent tipon
the Paciflc coast, many Chinese keeping
such dens. In this c.onnectian I would
mention that representations have been
made ta me personally within the last few
davs by gentlemen fram the Pacific coast,
Hon.

Mr.

ROBERTSON.

who very strangly urge that favourabl1e consideration should be given ta this amendment. They point out ta me thart at the
present time, with the large floating population that is naw employed at f airly high
wages, money is plentiful, and ahinese and
Japanese gambling dens ini particular are
running wide open in the ci'ty of Vancouver
city, and are having considerable influence
upon the existing condition ai industrial
unrest, in the oDinion of prominent business
men in Vancauver. They want this clause
inserted in the Act in arder that it may
assiist in wiping- out those gambling dens.
Section 6 is for the purpase of increasing
the penalty in cases of theft ai motor cars,
which is hecoming a commors offence.
It is alsa proposed that the folýlowing
new clause be added te the Bill as section
9, by way of amenciment:
,
This Act shali corne into oPeration ninety
days after it is assented ta by the Governor
General.

The reason given for that amendment,
which has been asked for by provincial
authcvrities, is that it is necessary for the
law ta be, known befare it goes into force.
Honourable gentlemen, it is probably
unnecessary for me ta dwell at any great
length upon the desirability or ne-cessity
for these clauses. Their desirability is, in
rny opinion, a.mply evident. The details af
the Bi-l can be discussed when the House
g-oes inta committee.
-Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemuen. I think that we have alreaiiy seen
eneugh of this Bill to recognize tha-t it la, a
rather seriaus one. There are in it many
provisions which should receive very carefui consideration by this honaurable Hanse.
It is right and proper ta pass legishation
dealing with Chinese dens or with persans
of the same character a.s those who rnn
such dens, but at the same time we must
see ta it that we do not provide an instrument whuich may be used for the purpoe
of blackmail against many persons who
cannot be classed with Chinese, Japanese,
and otheirs of bad character. Sa I think
'the Bill aught to be very carefully considered. If on consideration ai its different
clauses further information seeme riecessary,
we ouc"ht ta call witnesses, and, owmng to
the nature of t.he rubject-matter of the Bill,
wvhich is different froin that of other Bis,
it hiad betrter be deait with by special committee than by Committee of the Whole. I
be-g leave to move in amendment:
That this Bill be flot riow read a second timne,
but that it be referred ta a 'special committee

MAY 16, 1918
consisting of Hon. Messieurs
Pringle,
Eradbury, Daniel, Power, Casgrain, Watson, and
the mover. to consider and report te the House.

Hon. 'Mr. DANDURAND:
Tis is the
first time that I have heard, of a Bill being
referred to a cornmit.tee before being read
the second tinie. I thsink, it is cenitrary to
practice -and to our miles. I have not the
mules before mie at the moment. At this
stage the principle of the Bill, if there is
a princip]e in the Bill, should be either
affiDmed or rejected. It is only afIer the
second reading that a Bill is referTed Io
committee.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: What rule ié there
against sending it to committtee at the
present time, before the second reading-? I
wouid like to ýsee the i-nie.
Hon. M-Nr.
CLORAN: What is the object
cf referring it to a specia1 committee? Is
it 4,o kili the Bill? I amn simpiy asking for
information. It Étrikes me that at this time
of the session it is not possible to have
the Bill deait with bý -a special com-mititee.
Anyway, if the Bill is to 'be passed-and I
think -the Minister of Justice and the honourable minister who presented it here
want it to pass-it should flot be referred
to a committee when therc are oniy three
or four days of the session remaining. It
is understood that Parliarnent will prorogue by Empire Day.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: 1 cannot quoie
a mule a-ainst the proposition to refer a
Bill to celmsittee before the second reading.
but I can quite see the r-eason why such a
practice iould flot be adopted and tise propriety of pasging upon tise principle of a
Bill befere referringa the Bill 4o conimittee.
Otherwise tise cenîrxittee ni.ight sit day after
day and finaiiy deeide against tise Biii, and
it would be necessarv for tise "isole procedure te be cone over ag-ain in the House.
Hon. 'Mr. DANDUlIAND: Why does not
Ille isonourabie gentlemsan (Hon. W. B.
Ross) ailow the Bill f0 be advanced
a stage,
an(i after tlle seconsd reading mnove the
referenctý. That is tise proper thirsg Ie do.
Hon. W. 13. ROSS: The dificulty is that
if tise motion for tIse second reziding is
agcreed te, we adopt Isle princilp'e of the
Bill. The oiject that 1 hlave in view in
rnoving tisat thse Bili he re.ferred te a speciai
conimitec is f0 get information for tise
study -ot tise structure of tise Bill and to
have a report made whicic cals be usci
wisen tise Biii cornes before tis i nourabie
Heouse for Ille second reading.

Hon.

Mr. CHOQUETTE:

Tîseme ia ne

harm in adopting the principie of the Bi'l,
which is that the criminai law should be
amended. We are ail in favour of that
principle. Though the principle cf a Bill
ia in a certain sense adopted when the
Bill is read tise seconsd tinte, there is no
objection te maicing ansendmnents in coinmsittee, either in special committee or in
Committee of tise W'hole House. This is
tihe first time tîsat 1 have heard it proposed
that a Bill should be reýferred te committee
hefore its second reading. I raise the
point cf order that- the Bill cannot bq
referred to conimittee before the second
reading.
Hon. Mm. BEAUBIEN:
Honourable
gentlemen, it seems to me that there are
many very important questions of principle
involved in this Bili. For nsy part I do
not think I should like to vote for the Bill
as it stands. What objection is there te
lsaving a speciai committee study the Bill
and make a report? Then, when it cornes
up for second reading, the principie can be
discussed, and approved or rejected.
Hon. 'Mr. BELCOURT: Dees my honourable friend realize that a consmittee might
report a Bill and the House might s.ay,
"No, we cannot adopt the prineiple o!
it?'~ Then ail the work of the committee
wou]d be for nothing«
Hon. 'Mr. BEAUBIEN:
Well, what
difference %%ouid that make? It nsay net
be quite regular te refer the Bili to cernnsittee at tîsis stage, but it seems te
mse extremssely desirable te do se in this
case.
Hon. Mr. POWER: Honourable gentlemen, rny sentinsents witls respect te this
Bill are, I tisink, substantialiy indentical
with those of the isonourable gentleman
froni Middietor,
(Hon. W. B. Ross), but
there is just. tisis point. Tise honourable
ge.ntlensan timeughft that "'e should flot approve of Isle principle ef the Bill. Tisere are
certain clauses in Isle Bill whicis, I think,
sisould be passed, tisose beginning witi the
fourtîs clause. I do net think that there is
any serionS objection te afiy of tisose clauses,
and we nsizist pass tise second seadimsg just
iii erder to ýhoN\, tisat we de net dis-approve
ef Ille whole Bill. Vien, when tise Bill is

Orders:
63. No Bill shahl be read twice the samne

64. The principie of a Bill le usually debated

65. A senator snay, at any time before a Bill

I have not had time, to read over ail the
Standing Orders with reference to Bis,
but I take for granted that after the first
reading the nert step is necessarily the
second reading, and then the House goes
into committee or the Bill is referred to a
special or a standing committe.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: But there cari be ne
objection. to moving an amendment to a
Bill at any stage. However, if the understanding is that the only principle involved
in the econd reading of tihe Bull is that
the Criminal Code should be amend-ed, I
do not care if it is re-ad the second time
now. Then I will make my motion. I
withdraw my amendment and will renew it
after the second reading.
The amendinent of Hon. W. B. Ross ,vas
withdrawn and the motion for the second
reading was agreed to.
Ho-n. Mr. ROBERTSON movedThat this Bill be referred to a Commhttee of

provisions of the Bill, or expressing opinions as
to any circumstalces connected with Its introduction or prosecution or otherwise opposed to
its progress, or seeking further Information ln
relation to the Bill by committees, commissioners, the production of papers or other evidence, or the opinion of judges.

According to this, I think the honourable
gentleman irom Middieton was right in
mo-ring hig motion before the second reading, and, as on the spur of the moment I
raised a point of order, it is only fair that 1
shouid put these facts before the bouse.
Hon, W. B. ROSS - We have reached the

in matters of financial legisiation, and
ivhether, under the provisions of the British

and to what extent, or forbidden, for the

British North Arnerica
Act,
sible, and to what extent, or 1867, i. is permis forbidden., for the
Senate to amend a Bill embodNYing financial
clauses (Money Bill), have the honour to make
their Second Report, as follows:
Your Committee beg to report that in the
latter Part of the last Session of Parliament a
similar Commlttee was appointed, but owing
to the late date of appolntment opportunity Ivas
flot afforded the Committee for a fuil consideration of the Order of Reference. During the recess the Honourable W. B. Ross, a inember of
this Conlmittee, prepared a nienioranduiii des!ing with the question, copy hereto attached,
whàch memorandum bas been carefulîy conajdered and adopted by this Commrittee. The
following summing-up -thereof Is subrnitted as
the conclusions of your Committee on the rights
of the Senate In matters of financial legisiation:

1. That the Senate of Canada bas, and always
had since it was created, the power to amend
Buis originating in the Commons appropriating
any part of the revenue or iMposing a tax by
reducing the amnounts therein, but has flot the
right to increase the saime without the consent of the Crown.
2. That this power was given as an essential
part of the Confederation contract.
3. That the practice of the Imperiai Houses
of Parliament in respect of Money Bis Is no
part of the Constitution of the Dominion of
ýCanada.
4. That the Senate in the past bas repeatedly
amended so-called Money Buis, In some cases
wlthout Protest frorn the Commons, whlle in.
other cases the Bis
were ailowed to Pass, the
Commons protestlng or clalming that the Sepate
touid flot amend a Money Bill.
5. That Rule 78 of the House of Comznons of
Canada claiming for that body powers and
priviieges In connection with Money Bis
Identical wlth those of the Imperial House of Commons ls unwarrsnted under the provisions of
The British North Amnerica Act, 1867.
6. That the Senate. as shown by The British
North Amnerica Act, as weli as by the discussion
In the Canadian Legisiature on the Quebec
Resolutions, in addition to Its general powers and
duties, la speciaily empowered to safeguard the
rights of the provincial organizations.
7. That, besides general legisiation, there are
questions such as provincial subsidies, publie
lands In the western provinces, andl the rlghts of
the provinces in connection wlth pendlng railwsy legislation and the adjustment of the rlghts
of the provinces thereunder lkely to arise at
any time, and It la important that the POwerS
of the Senate relatlng thereto be thoroughly
understood.
'Your Commlttee are lndebted to Messieurs
Eugene Lafleur, X.C., Aimé Geoffrion, X.C., and
John S. Ewart, K.C., prominent constitutional
authorities. of Montreal and Ottawa, who have
been good enough to forward their views on the
question under consideration by your Committee. These opinions are appended hereto and
form part of the Committee's Repnrt.

Memoranduni re Rights of the Senate In 'Malters
of Financial Legisiation.
The Constitution and Powers and Practice of
the House of Lords and the House of Commons are so xvell known that it is unnecessary te
refer to theni except so far as it is requlred
to explain the constitution and functions of
the Canadian Senate.
The inquiry wvill be
limlited to the powers of the Senate In resrpect of "Money Bllls"'-Bills appropriatlng any
part of the revenue or imposing a tax.
The House of Lords has at present six hundred and odd miembers, and ail of these except
about sevenlv owe their positions to birth. The
Crewn basa the
prerogative to
create an
unlimited nuinher of new peerages. This ls commonly known as the
swamping power," and
has often been described as the safet3--valve
of the British constitution.
P'rom recent legislation It la quite clear that the House of Commons supported by the Crown can Impose any
terms on the House of Lords. Till then that
House had constitutionaily co-ordinate powers

(In 1671 the Commons affirmed that "in al

Lords."
In 1678 the Commnnits resolved: "That ail

right of the Commons to direct. limit and
appoint In such Bills the ends, purposes. considerations, conditions, limitations and qualifications

altered by the House of Lords."
The House of Lords protested, but this was
the practice thtereafter. In 1861 the Commons
asserted the right to include ail financial proposais in the annuai Suppiy Bili, and thus. not
havlng the power te amend. the Lords would
have to pass the Bill or rejeCt It as a whole.
This was protested 'against by the Lords, but
was thereaiter the practice. The power of
the House of Lords over finance was practically gone froni that day. This was the state oi
the practice concerning finance between the
two Imperlal Houses when the British North
America Act was passed in 1867.

The constitution of 1791 for the pros inces of
rpper and Lower Canada provided for a Legîstative Council of a named number for each
province, reserving to the Crown the riglit to
name as many more as it saw fit. There ivas
aise provision for the creation of hiereditary
Councillors. Nothing was aaid about the relation of the Houses or money Bis. It is probable
that Parliament assumed that the Council would
foilow the Engiish parliamentary practice. and
if it did net it couid be "swamped." The Council ivas an almost perfect miniature of the
House of Lords.
The constitution of 184-0, when these two provinces were united. was in the main the samie.

certain number (20), and power was reserved to

There are several Constitutions in the southern hemisphere oi practically the sanie structure.
The Colonial Office sald that those Counci.,
should foliow the practice of the House of
Lords and net amend mnney Bis, but might
reject theni. The Privy Council also decided
against the Legislative Council of Queensland
(which was a nomlnated Council withi the
"'swamiping power") in its claim to amiend moneY
Bis.
In New South Waies the Counicil was to consist of at least twenty-one members. but thcre
was no legal limit to the total number. -Marriott,
Second Chambers. p. 156, says: " There have

more successful in obtaining fromn Lord Carrington permission to add members to the Legistative Chamber at the convenience and discretion
of thec Executive. That principle, closely akin
to one whlch bas long prevailed in the miother

"This plan gave the Second Chamnber somiething of the influence and attributes of the

(Responsible Government In the Dominions. p.

the practice of the flouse of Lords should
govern In such a case." He also, on the last
page of vol. 1 of bis works, refers to the action
of the Legislative Council o! Quebec in tbrowlng out a Supphy Bjill. He mentions tbe fact
that it was a noniinated Blouse without the
swamplng power, and seems by bis mention of
this to recognize that sucb a Council is different
froni those where such power exiets.
The next matter of importance to note Is
Tbe
that the British Constitution is unitary.
King and Lords and Commons bave a jurisdlcto the creation
tion oe and undlvided. Prior
of the Dominion of Canada tbe Colonies wlthln
the scope o! their constitutions were unitary.
The Governor. Council. and Assembly bad tbe
whole jurlsdictlon. The Crown cannot create
a Dominion, and Canada recslved Its constitution
fromn the Imperlal Parliament. The Dominion
Is the Colony, and the Provinces are parts o!
The Dominion appoints the
thie Colony.
Lieutenant Governors of tbe Provinces, wbo
communicate tbrough the Governor General with
the Imperial Government.
The Constitution of thie Dominion o! Canada
was therefore new in the lins of Colonial Constitutions. The legal effect of the words of tbe
British North Anierica Act wll bave to be
ssttled (as Acte of Par la.ment are conatrued)
by tbe plain meanlng of the worde used. That
Act begins with a recital that tse Provinces
bave expressed a desire to be federally unlted,
with a Constitution similar In principhe to tbat
of the United Kingdom, and this it dos by
providing that the executive power and authority
sbould continue and be vestsd in the Queen, and
that the hegisiative power sbouhd be in a Fat-liament consieting of the Queen and the two
flouses. This le the main principle. but tbere
are rnany detale in working it out. One o!
these is the Constitution of the Senate o!
eeventy-two members, neyer to exceed seventyeigbt.
The Provinces, fit-st of ail. are divided into

these are not !ound. In (boss above mentioned
(1791) and (1840) a Councillor was required
onhy to be a Britisb subject of twenty-ons years
of age.

The Statute shows a fundamental difference
between the Senate and the House of Lords.
The senators are appointed to represetit the

Commons are elected for constituencies, and are
summoned under Section 38 of the Act to attend. This pute thern on the footing of Memnbers
of the Eng]ish House of Comrnons, and they
serve for ail Canada. See Blackstone, Book 1,
Chapter 2, p. 159. wbere he says that the
Members of the English House of Commons
are sumnmoned. and that they serve for the
wbole lCingdom.
Then, the Senate is an Upper House in a
federation and flot in a unitary State or
Legisiative Union, as ie the House of Lords.
The Senate is more like that of the United
States or the Upper House in Germany or
Switzerland. If it, le flot the fit-st duty of the
Senate to protsct Provincial intersts it Is impossible flot to infer frgm the terms of the Act
that this le a duty cast upon it. Why else the

Why flot an appointment to the

Senate simply as in the House o! Lords or
the flomiflated Legislative Council already tferred to? Such fundamental changes are flot
made for nothing. The first duty of the Senate
le to protect and preserve Provincial rigbts
and Interests. No such duty is requlred of the
House of Lords or of any of the Legislativs
Councils in the Provinces. More than that,
from the Act It is quite clear that to enable the
Senate to do this it was made an independent
body by the abolition o! the swamping power,
and maklng the tenure of the position for life.
It has, of course, other powers and duties consequent on Its being an Independerrt part of
the Constitution.
The British North America Act Imposes one
extrex»ely Important limitation on the powsrs
of the Senate. Sections 53 and 54 of the Act
read:
*(.53) Bills for appropriaitlng a-ny Part o! the
Public Revenue or for imposing any tax or
impost shall originate in the House of Corn'nons.
"«(54) It shal flot be lawful for the House
of Commons to adopt or pass any Vote. ResoluLion, Address or Bill for the appropriation of

or lmpost Co any put-pose that bas flot 'ceen
firat recommended to that House by Messsge
of the Governor General in the Session ini which
sucb Vote, Resolution, Address or Bill is propos-ed."
It is worth noting that this last Section simply
embodies the practice o! the I.mperial H-ouse
o! Commons. That House may reduce; it can

the House of Lords. <Ses Todd. vol. 1, p. S11.)
When the House of Comnmons passes an appropriation or tax Bill it muet be either for

and 54.
Again, why difi the Imperial Parliament, when
passing the British North America Act, insert
as Section 53 oaîY a part of the Resolution of
1678, knowing that the power cf inipesing the

The tact la that it was the Resolution of 161

It ls evident that the Canadian Senate, subject to Uic limitations of Sections 53 and 54 of
the British North Amnerîca Act, is an independent body with coordinate povJers %vith the
flouse of Commons, and entitled to make its
own Rules and Practice.

We have seea that "nominated" Councils with

Ia the ParliaznentaryDebates, 3rd Session, Provincial Parliameat of Canada, on the subject cf
the Confederation of the British North Anierican
Provinces, at page 21, Mr. Campbell gave the
reasons fer the Conference determining as they
had on the constitution of the lJpper flouse,
and saye: "And the main reason was te give
each cf the provilaces adequate security for the

protection Off its local interests. a prOteetion
which it was feared miglit flot be found ln a
Bouse where the representation was based on
numbers only, as would lie the case in the
General Assernbly. The number of representatives to the Legisiative Council under the Fedex-ai Constitution would be lnxited. and they
would lie appolnted for life instead of elected
by the people."
"For the purpose of securing
equality in that Bouse the Confederation would
lie divided."
He then explains why the Senate
was not elective:
Upper Canada was growing
fast, and an agitation miglit arise there for
greater representation. "They (Ontario) might
object to the Fishing Bounties paid the Lower
Provinces, to the snoney expended there in
fortifications, or to something else, and claim
a representation in the Counicil more ln accordance wlth theix- population to enforce their
vlews; and, In view of such contingencies. the
delegates f rom those Provinces conceived It
would not be safe to trust theix- rlghts to an
elective Bouse." At page 22. col. 1, x-eferx-ng
to the Constitution of the United States, he
says: ' In this way the smallest State, like
Rhode Island, was as fully x-epxesented'as the
State of New York, and If that was considered

the United States, how much more would lit

Sir John Macdonald says. at page 29, vol. 1:
«'We wex-e fox-ced to devise a systemn of union
in which the Beparate Provincial ox-ganizations
would be ln some degree preserved&"
At page
35 lie says: " We resolved then that the Constitution of the Upper Blouse should lie in accordance wlth the British system as nearly as
clrcumnstances would allow." At page 36 he
says: " The px-ovision in the constitution that
the Legislative council shall consist of a llmlted
number of memblers--that each of the great
sections shahl appoint twenty-four and no morewill prevent swaminpng. The fact of the Government being prevented from exceeding a certain
number will preserve the independence of the
Upper Bouse." etc. At page 38, col. 1, speakIng of the limitation of the numiber of senators.
Sir John sald: "To the 'pper House Is to be
confided the protection 0f sectional intereats:
therefore it is that the three great divisions are
there equally represented for the purpose of
defending such Interests agalnst majorities in
the Assembly." And further on he says: "For
the samne reason each State off the American
Union sends its two best mnen to represent it in
the Senate." On page 42 he says, *'We provide
there shahl le no rnoney votes unless these
votes are introduced in the popular brandi of
the Leglslatu-e." At page 35, top of column 1,
Sir John refers to the Powex-s and Privileges
of the Comnions. It should lie noted that Section 18 of the British North Ainerica Act had
to lie enacted to give the Canadian Houses the
Powex-s and Privileges of the Imiperial
as there was no provision off this kindHouses,'
in the
Quebec Resolutions.
The Privy Cou-ncil has
decided that this section does not include legislative power (Kelth, p. 558). At page S9, Mr.
George Brown says.' " But honourable gentlemen must see that the limiitation of the numbers in the Upper Bouse lies at the hase of the
whole compact on which this scherne rests."

He went on to say that power to increase the
number would sweep away the whole protection
they had from the Lower Bouse
Be shows
further that the Senate though nominated is
representative.
At page 92 he refers to the
tact that the Lower Bouse would have control
of the purse. Ontarilo, he says, had seventeen
more members than Quebec. and the people of
Ontario could get faix- play.
At page 90 he
says: "But it is objected tint In the constitution
of the Uppex- Bouse, so fax- as Lowe- Canada Is
concerned, the exlstlng electoral divisions are
to be niaintained, whule as regarda Upper
Canada they are to, be abollehed-that the

of the loss of Influence to Ontario:« "BI-itherto

expenditure.
But under thus plan. by our
just Influence in the Lower Chamber, we shail
hold the purse strings." At page 92, he says:
"We are to have seventeen additldnal members
In the Bouse that ho'lds the purse." At page
90 lie says: " The desire was to render the
Upper House a thoroughly Independent bodyone mhat would lie In the best position to, canvass
dispassionately the inensures of this Bouse.
and stand up for the public lnterests in opposition to hasty or partisan legialation."
Mr-.
Dorion, at page 254, at the foot of col.

points out that the effect off abolishing the
sw'anping power ivas to, make the Senate entirely idependent.

Senate always bas an advantage which no
sipper Chamber in a unitary state (as, for example, the House of Lords in England> can

leesens the possibilities of comparîson. and
renders many apparent analogies totally misleading." (Temperley, p. 209.)

The Honourable W. B. Rtoss,
The Senate, Ottawa, Ont.
Dear Sir-Wý%e have been asised if in our
opinion the Senate has the power to amiend
Money Buis.
Sections 17 and 91 of the British North
America Act place the Senate on exactly the same
footing as the House of Commons as respezts
ail legislation.
The only snaterial derogation to this general
rule is contained ln section 53, whlch provides
that Bills for appropriating any part of the
public revenue or for imposing any tax or
impost shall originate in the House of Commons.
The denial of the right to originate Money
Buis does not involve the denial of the right
to amend them. Nothing, therefore, in the text
of the British North Amnerica Act takes away
the latter right from. the Senate.
The first paragraph of the preamble, where it
is stated that the provinces desire to be united
federally with a constitution similar ln principle to that of the United Kingdomn, is relled on.
These words, being ln the preamble, have much
less importance, than if they were ln the text.
Further, it Is obvious that simllarity in principle
The Canadoes not mean identity ln detail.
dian constitution differs from the British constitution in many and important respects; the
similarity in principle referred to in the preamble is intended to exlst only to the extent stated
in the text.
The third paragraph of the preamble states
that it ls expedient, not only that the constitution of the Legislative authority in the Dominion
be provlded for, but also that the nature of the
Exeýcutive G-overniment therein be declared, and
the text of the Act contains many sections which
mierely restate rules of the British constitution,
such as section 53, already referred to.
If the above-mentionned words of the preanible nîeant that the British constitution apîflies
to Canada excelit in so far as the text of the Act
cxpressly derogates therefrom, the third paragraph of the preamble and ail those sections,
partîcularly section 53, would be useless or
mea ningless.
The consideration of how the rule limiting the
pcwers of the House of Lords in the United
Kringdom, camýe to be adopted affords; an additional argument in support of the view suggested
by the text of the British North America
Act.
In the early days there was a conflict between
the British House of Commons and the Ilouse
of Lords on this question of the powvers of
the House of Lords in r-espect of Monley Bis.
Ili 1678 the Commons resolved:
'That ail aida and supplies and auls to Ilis
Majesty in Parliament are the sole gîft of the
Coiiniions, and tliat ail Buis for tue grarnting of
any such aids and supplies ought to hegin
with the Commons, and that it is tue uniloulîted
and sole righit of the Comimons to dirct, limit
a ailippo in t in sucliB u the endls. pu rposes,
coîîsiderations, conditions, limitations. and quaiifcations of such grains. which oughit flot to bc
changed or aitered by the House of Lords."
Ilo 1693 the Lords resolved:
"Tîtat the inaking of aiendments anud ahatenieun. i f rates of Bis of Suppl, sent up froîn

MAY 16, 1918
the House of Commnons is a fundaînental. inherent and undoubted riglit of the HOUSe of
Peers from. which their Lordships can xîever depart."
lt is true that the Lords did nlot act in accordance with this resolution, and tacitly subrnîtted
to the claim of the Commons. obviously to avoid
a conilict with the latter House. but tis practice
was flot the law, and this appears fromn the
preanible of the Flouse of Commons resolution
of 1910, whlch announced the proposed legisiatien curtalling the .powers of the Lords. <May's
Parliamnentary Practice. 12th edition, p. 518.)
It is remarkable that of the two restrictions
on the rights of the Lords whlch the Commons
by its resolution of 1678 tried to Impose, namely:
the denial of the right to originate, and the
denial of the right to amend, Money BUis, the
British North America Act, whUle mentioning the
first in section 53. shouid flot mention the second
against which the Lords had speciaiiy protested.
If It had been the Intention of the British
Parliament to impose the two restrictions on
the Senate, It surely would have mentioned
both. or. If content to rely on the preamble as
incorporating the whole British constitution, It
would have anentioned neither.
To these reasons migbt be added this further
consideration, that there ts very littie analogy
between the Lords and the Senate. The Lords
represent themseives *.theSenate represent the
Provinces. The Lords are flot in an Independent
position, as the House of Commons can use its
Influence over the Crown and Induce it to add
as many members as are needed to the House
of Lords te obtain a favourabie majority.
It ls probably for that reason that section 18
of the British North America Act, when dealing
with the privileges, immunities and powers o!
the Senate, refers, as the maximum of such
privileges, immunities and powers. to those held.
cnJoyed and exercised by the Imperiai House of
Commons (and nlot by the House of Lords) at
the passing of the Act.
Under the circumstances. we are of the opinion
that the Senate of Canada mnay amend a Money
Bill originating in the House o! Comnmons as
0f
!uiiy as the House of Conimons can do.
course, the powers o! the Senate are Iiiimited ta
the same extent as tho.ce of the House of
Commons by the !act that Money Bis mnust be
rec'nmmended by a message of the (lovernor
Generai.
Yours truly.

400 Wiibrod Street,

The Hon. Senatar W. B. Ross,
The Senate, Ottawa.
Dear Sir,-In reply ta yaurs of the 23rd
Instant, I beg te say that 1 have read with much
re rights of the
iriterest the -Memoranduin
Senate in matters of financiai legislation,- and
I find in It a great deal that, were the matter
now being discussed for the flrst trne. rnight
weii be urged in support af what is evidentiy
the writer's view.
In considering ail subjects of the ciass ta
wvhich the vresent beiongs, regard lias aIway'S
-and very rightiy-been paid ta Ilistory and
precedents; and the relations between our Senate and Hause of Conimons are, as I
think, sc, firmnly established that no change

couid be introduced save by canstitutional
amendmen.t. I do nlot mean, necessariiy. by
amendment of the British North Amienda Act.
Aniendment of constitutionai practice, agreed
upon by bath Houses, wouid suflice.
From the very eariiest time, the Colonial
Assembiies have suocessfuliy contended for the
saine priv'iiege with reference ta Financiai Bis
as that enjoyed by the British House o! Coimeons. The cases In which contention arase are
very numerous; but 1 do niat know of any In
which the quarrel between the twvo Houses has
resuited In substantiai victory for the Cauncilas, in the earlier constitutions, the second
chamber was styied.
A glance at the histories furnishes me wîth
two Instances which may be taken as containlng
typicai assertion of the priviiege o! the Assemblies. The first of these la noted In Dickerson*s
Amerîcan Colonial Government, 1696-1765. The
author says (p. 160) that. in the time of Governor Cornbury, 0f New York:
"The Council sought ta amend the Revenue
Bill so as to remove this obJection, but it was
met by the point-blank assertion that the assembly wouid permit no amendment of money
Buis."
The second Instance I take from Dr. ICingsford's book. the History of Canada, volume 9,
page 217. On that occasion (1818) the Council
and Assembly were brought into sharp conffict,
with the resuit. as the author says. that:
"The Council did nlot conceive an amefidment
to the money Bill as a breach 0f privilege; but
as it was s0 asserted. the Council would hereafter forbear from ail amendment. and simpiy
reject any Bill submitted to It, shouid occasion
suggest.",
There can be no doubt that the difference
between the British House o! Lords and the
Canadian Senate referred ta In the Memorandumn are 0f substantiai character; but, after ail,
the two Houses, w4th reference ta the subject
under consideration, occupy the saine position.
For the members of neither House are elected
by the people, and the priviiege of the Assemhly
bas aiways heeil
with regard ta money Bis
based upon the fazt that the Hause was composed of popularly-elected members.
In the United States, it is hecause bath the
Senate and the House of Representatives have
always been composed of men elected hy the
peopie-either by direct vote or, indirectiy. by
the State Legislature-that the two Houses have
concurrent authority.
I sam, Sir.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I think this report
is a very valuabie one, and that the Chairmancf the Committee, who has just spoken,
deserves very great credit and praise for
the amount cf work he bas given and the
abil-ity he bas sh6wn in deaiing with this
matter. I think the -report puts the viexvs
o! the Senate -in regard te the quetstion cf
money Bills in a lîghit that is, in many
respects new to most of the miembers cf
the Senate. Since I have had. the bonour
cf a fflat in this Chamber the usuai view
adopted bas been that in regard to matters
of finance the Senate is ver-y iargely guided
by the practice and procedure followed in
Engiaund. But, -as the honourabie gentileman (Hom. W. B. Ross) bas pointed eut,
that view was based on the idea, that the

1 invite the attention of every mienber

of every menber of this House, or of any

either conêciousiy or unconsciously, give

'In addition to that, the subject is a verv

In answver to the honourabie genxtleman

the absence of that pravisa in Bis *incarparating private campanies wouid indicate
that they are flot subject ta the Railway

Hon. Mr. POPE: What makes you think

Hon. Mr. MACDONEIjL: I amn giving
my reasons, and wiii continue ta do so, if
permitte.d. Under the most recent decision
of the Privy Council, where the provisions
of a generai Act-the Raiiway Act in this
,case-corne into conflioct with the provisions
of a special Act, the speciai Act prevails,
and the generai Act is a! noaeff ect. The
Privy Council bas so decided in a case
which. is weii known in this flouse and in
the other Chamber. Sa where there la confilet or want of perfect accord between a
generai Act and a speial Act, we should

of the Bill as it stands was copied from
the Standard clause in a Bill incorporating
the Edmonton and Southxvestern Railway
Company, passed in 1916. The two clauses
are precisely alike. As ta this Bill there
was a misaýpprehension in the cosmmittee.
Vie Law Clerk stated that it xvas creating
a precedent which would be dangerous in
the future. Later on be discovered that it
was not creating a precedent-that, sucb a
clause had already been adopted and passed
by the Senate. This is a rather important
measure. It has gone through the House of
Gommons, it has pas6.ed the aminuittee of

Reasons have been given for the passing
oi this Act to-day. This Bill came up before the comrnittee and they decided that
it was ail right. My honourable friend
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Macdonell) spoke
of the general Railway Act. What kind of
a ganeral Railway Act is that which doas
not take in everything that has to do with
railways, that does not cover this and every
other piece of lagisiation that cornes into
this House? Are we going to be asked -to
dafer this Act, which, as I *nderstand, is
going to bring advantage to, a great number
of our population, and lay it over for another year simply because two or three
lawyers here say that it is not just what it
ought to be, and have in their minds some
technical way of hlocking it for a while?
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: Question, question.

to be careful about calling question, it is
rny honourable friend from Toronto. I always speak to the question. As I understand, it, and as the committee understood
it, this railway is going to ha an advantage
to a certain number cf people, and the
members from that particular part of the
province cf Quebec have joined in asking
that this Bill should be put througah. Now,
I arn prepared to, foflow those men, and
not to follow the lawyers. I amn prepared

cornes into this House in connection witb
these matters?
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: My honourable

speaking in that wvay.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: My honourable friend
only exposedt his own ignorance in that
instance. I rnay tell him that there was
intelligence here before he carne into this
building, and there will be intelligence here
when he goes out of it; we are flot dependent wholly and solely upon his head for
intelligence. We are here te legisîste for
the advantage of the people cf this country in whatever Gection we mnay find
thern, and we have a right to put
this Bill through. The honourable gentleman wbo is promoting this Bill states that
the addition cf the words proposed in the
arnendrnent would do ne harin or ne good,
but he says the only reason for crnitting
thern is that the adoption of the arnendrnent
proposed would prevent the Bill frorn going
through this session. I hope the House
will support the Bill as it is.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: I arn glad to hear
the honourable gentleman who has taken
his seat defending the farmers here; at
laast, he shows them sorne respect, and
dees not treat thern as was dcne in another
part of 'this building. Therefore, 1 think
the farmers xvill be most thankful te hlm
for bis remarks. I thoroughly agree with
him in regard to lawyers framing Bisý;
they frame themn obscurely, especially to

then the poor judge doas flot know what

it is going te, do a lot of good in, the section

flot in it, "subjact to the provisions cf the

that tha promoters of the company in
charge of this Bill have no objection whatever to the introduction of that clause;

MAY 17, 1918
they do nlot want to evade the laws af the
country, and they are willing to submit
themselves te the general law; but unfortunately the cammittee reported the Bill
as it is without those few words. As the
senator irom Bedford has wel1. said, if this
amendment is adopted, and the Bill is sent
back to the Commons, it xviii be among the
massacred innocents, ta use the parliamentary phrase applied in England ta Bils
that are thrown aside at the close of a
session. This Bill has gone through the
House of Conimons and through the
Senate committee, and it would be a pity ta
practically kili it by having ta arnend it
just for the sake af adding this lit'tle clause.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I intimated ta the House some time ago that I

appreciation of the entire Bill as we, propose
ta amend it. I section 1 it is proposed ta
strike out, in the fourteenth line, the words
"Minister af Public Works- and ta insert

In eection 2, in line 21, it ia

it in the hands ai the Governor in Council.
I .painted out ta my honourable friend from
Hamilton, who is somnewhat appreheinsive
as te the application of this Bill te certain
interest in his district, that it is proposed
ta amend subsection 1 of the prapased reenactment of section, 5 &! the Navigable

the following words:

Hon. Mr. -LYNOH-STAIJNTON: I wish

study, and 1 consider it retroactive in its
provis'ions, confiscatory of people's property, and ultra vires of this Parliarnent.
Now let me point eut te you what the law
is, and how it is proposed te change the
law. There is ne person who owns any
property on any shore on any navigable
stream or lake in Canada whose rights are
flot being inte'rfered with by this Bill. 1

law as it now stands. The Act respecting

which ît is p'ropesed to repeal, says:

Hon. C. E. TANNER: I confess that I
arn not quile able to fod-low the argument
of the honourable member from -Hamilton
<Hon. Mr. Lyneh-Staunton) in this matter.
I had not. given the subject matter any particular consideration before t.his d.iscus6lon
aroee this afternoon, but I1have in mind a
case the very opposite of that to which the
honourable gentleman, bias referred. Within the past year or two, whean private owners ailong the East river of Pictou proposed
te build a bridge acrosa 'that -river at a
very important part, a grave injustice
would have been done te the public, and
there would have been a serious- interruption of navigation but for the provision of
the Navigable Waters Act, which compelled
the owners to submit their case t e the
Governor in Council. If it were net for that
requirement, they would no doubt have constructed the bridge, but fortunately the
public were saved by the very provisions of
this Navigable Waters Act.
Now, a-- I understand the fundamental
principles involved in these matters, a person w'ho acquires. what is called a water
lot acquire6 simply the tile to the soil under the water. There is a genieral fallacy
prevailing that- -w'en a man or a ceînpany
acquire a water lot thcy acquire aise the
water which fiows over that lot.

riglit te assert.
fromn Hamilton lias given us a case in bis
own local'ty whiere *a comipany is, filling in
a water lot in a place whiere, hie says, the
watera are flot navigable. I have not recently looked into tle question of navigable waters, but 1 remeniber doing se some
time ago, and I would have grave doubt
that the judgment wvhich the honourable
gentleman hias expressed to us this afternoon with regard to what are net navigable
waters would be sustained by the autherities. I -rise only for the purpose of pointing out that the case in the county of
Pictou te which 1 have referred seems to
be in point with his illustration; and the
fundamental principle of this Bill, as I
understand it, is the protection of the public against the encroachment of individuals.
Hon. GEO. McHUGH: May I ask the

protection against individuals such as those
who proposed to block navigation by the

fact, that there must be soinebody to decide what ia and what, is net navigable

"Work"l 4ncludea any bridge, boom, dam,

This Bill adds:
-tunnel or pipe, or telegraph or power cable
or wire and the approaches or other work
necessary or appurtenant thereto.
Hon. Sir JAM1ýES LOUGHEED: That is
the existing law. This is new:
-or any work, structure or device, whether
similar in charaoter to the foregoing or flot,

'Hon. Mr. LYNOH-6TAUNTON: There is
the whole point.
'Hon. Sir JAIMIES LOUGHEED: When
this Giovernment is charged with authority over the navigation of navigable streams,
is it unreaeonable to say that no structure or
device shall be erected over -a navigable
stream, which, in the opinion of the M-NinieVer of Public Works, may interfere with
navigation?

Hon. -Sir JAMES LOUGIEED: I-f that
is the principle laid down by my
lionourable friend, we bave a clear-cut, welldefined division betwveen us. If niy bonourable friend propounds the doctrine that
any person should be permitted ta construct a device whichi will interfere with
the navigation of a navigable river, I understand his objection to the Bill.
Hon. Mr. LYNCTH-STAUNTON:
The
leader of the Goveranent misapprebends
me. My point ia that the Governnient

was dioing. It is intended ta prevent interference with navigation, not interference
with what -"inthe opinion " of somebody
may be an interference. Suppose the minister says, - You are inýterfering," and I
think I arn not, eurely I amn not ta be prevented from going Vo the Governor in Council and asking for a fiat? Il this is passed,
when the minister expresses an opinion the
controvversy is ended.
Han. Sur JAMES LOUGHEED: Oh, no.
The Gavernar in Council cauld determine
that.
Honý. Mr. LY-NCH-STAUNTO.N: '«In hie

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 1 have
stricken out -the words "Minister of Publie
Works," so that it now will read, "wh
in the opinion of the Governor in Council
may interfere, with navigation."
Hon. Mr. LYNO H-STAUNTON:- That is
t.he same thing. Why not put in the samne
words, "«unless the site thereof bas been
approved by the Governor in Council?" As
long as the language of the old Act ie adhered ta I do not mind the addition of these
other structures.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Under
section 4 of the existing Act the site must
be approved by the Governor in Council,
and the works likewise miust be approved
by the Governor in Council. Mherein. is the
difference?
Hon. M'Nr.
LYNCH-STAUNTON: The old
Act says:
No bridge, boom, dam or aboiteau shall be
constructed so as to Interfere with navigation.
The Bill says:
.-which in 'the opinion of the Minieter of
Public Works niay interfere w'ith navigation.
I want the law continued as it is.
Hon. MNr. GIRROIR: As I understand it,
the aId Act provides that if a work actually

Public Works -lias the right, ta stop it. In

Hon. '-%r. CLORAN: 1 think the honourable gentlisan froii Hamnilton (Hon. Mr.
Lynch-St:auiiton) should consider the suggestion of the leader of the Governrnent. I
agree with the hosnourable gentleman frorn
Hamilton in say'ing that the authority
given to one man is too wide, because, aiter ail, the Minister of Public Works is Mr. Brown, .and Mr. Brown
neyer sees one-haif or one-third of the
things that go on in bis departrnent. He
sends out a man who coines back and reports
and it is the opinion of the civil ernployee
w'hich will prevail. The mînister knows
nothing of these things, and cannet be expected to. If hie sends a 'man down who
hias a grudge against a neighbour-we al
know how these things are carried on,hie cornes back to the minister and reports
ag-aînst the wvork. The leader of the Geverniment gives us a better guarantee for
the safety and the protection cf property
in the words: "in the opinion of the
Governor in Council." It is harder to get
the opinion of the Governor in Counicil than
it is to get tise opinion of the M-%inister of
Public W'orks. You cannot expeot one man

Honi. 'Mr. GIRROIR: Tise ninister, or the
Governor in Council, will decide that.
Hen. Mr. CLORAN: He shou-ld net lie
alloNved ýte. There slsould be a clause defining that. -That a felew gees down a
atream in a canoe and takes a young lady
witls hirn, is ne reason for calling a little
stream a navigable streaim; but under the

the right te say that it was. Navigable
stseaîsss should lie defined. They should
oîsiy lie calIed navigable if power is
used for navigating thein--either hersepower te pull barges along the banks
of a river, or some other power. Because
sorne one paddles down a stream, is
it right or fair te eall it a navigable strearn?
Take the Ottawa river and the St. Lawrence
river. They are navigable, but there are
portions which are not navigable. Because
certain portions are really navigable, will
proprieters along eight or ters miles of the
shore where there is nothing but rapids,
and where navigation ia net possible, be
compelled te consider themselves as corning
under this law? That question is net de,cided in the Bill. The Lachine rapids on
the St. Lawrence river extend for seven or

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I cannot see why
the honourable gentleman fromn Hamilton
is se worked up ever this Bill. To my
mind it makes very little difference in the
law as it stands. The only differenice is
that certain words have been added.
Hon. Mr. LYNCU -1STAUNTON: The
whiole law is changed.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: I do net think
there la very much change. The words
"tunnel or pipe, or telegraph or power cable
or wire" are new, and the reasons whicli
prompted the .putting of the other werds into
the Bill can be applied with equal force te
newv words. If there is reasen why the
erectien ef a bridge or boom sheuld be
under the supervision of the Minister of
Public Works, it eeems te nme that there
la a stronger reason why the erection of a
tunnel or a pipe should be under the same
supervision. Navigation may be more seriously obstructed by a tunnel or -a pipe than
by a bridge or a boom. When you work
out ail the sections, you arrive at the conclusion that ultimately the decision resta
withi the Governor in Counceil, whiether
under the old Act or under this leg-islatien.
It la the Governor in Council who finally
decides whether -a structure is te be tomn

provision.
My hionourable friend seems te forget the
right of the public te navigation. The
Geverinnent is the only protecter ef the
public ri-lit te the use ef navigable waters
in this country, and unleas yoeu put it in
the liands ef the Governor General to
prevent inpediments te navigation, how

righlt would flot be gene, because an Order
in Counicil could be passed.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: I wish to say just
one or two words in order that I may
understand the question better before I arn
called upen te vote on it. No one for a
moment disputes the contention of the
honourable gentleman hemi Ottawa, (Hon.
Mr. Belcourt) that the Government hias a
right, through its Department of Public
Works, to see lthat navigation in the
waters of Canada ir, net
navigable
That is conceded on
interfered with.
aIl hands and cannot be disputed.
The point that the'honourable gentlemnan
f romi Hamilton makes, as I understand it,
is that under the existing Act the Minister
of Public Works lias a right to interfere
when any one bu.ilds any structure which
interferes with navigation. The question
as to what is a navigable water is a mixed
question of ]aw and f act, and any one can
go to the courts and endeavour to establish
his dlaim that the work which hie hias built
or proposes to build, does flot interfere
with navigation, or is not buit in navigable
waters. Under the old Act hie bas that right;
but -the new Act is vastly different, because it says that his work can *be stopped,
removed or destroyed, if in the opinion of
the Governor in Council it interferes with
navigation. This distinction is very wide,
and it seenis te me that te give that power
te the Governor in Counicil would absolutely shut eut the right given under the
o]d Act te settle in the courts the question
tvhether the work interferes, with navigatien or is in navigable waters. Another
feature touched upon by the honeurable
miemiber for Hamilton is worth considering.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: May I
point out that we are limiting the discussien at present to the point as te the determination by the Governor in Council o-f
what constitutes navigable water. If rny
henourable friend will look at section 4 of
chapter 115, the existing Act, hie wilI observe that the approval o-f the Governer in
Council lias to be given to the site, and
aise te the works te be constructed; and
if the Governer in Counicil withholds- approval of course the site cannot be selected
and the works cannot be proceeded -with.
If the Governor in Counicil should give ap.
proval, then it is quite manifest that the
determination of the question rests with
the Governor in Couincil.

tion or wag built in -navigable waters, but
whether these -things were so in the opinion of the Minister of Publie Works. This
Act gives him absolute power te determine,
without aliowing the right to the party
aggrieved te submit his case to the courts.
If I arn correct in my'interpretation of thié
new section I do nlot think this amendment
should pass.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I wouid ask thf

in Council and the approval of the Governor

Hon. W. B. ROSS: But it is my point.
There
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:

Hon. W. B. ROSS: Do you draw any
distinction between the two? The old Act
says the approval of the Governor in Council and the new paragraph (a) uses thi
phrase, "the opinion of the Governor in

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: The introduction of the term "navig-able water,"

point is that the saine authority has net

oid Act the questions, whether the water
in which a structure is being built is a
navigable water, and whiether the structure

does interfere with navigation, and that

Hon. Mr. GIRROIR:
Here is the old
Section 4:

Hon. M-Nr.
POWER: 1 do flot think The
climate of Nova Scotia is favourable to the
gr.owth of toobaceco. The climiate of Briti6h
Columbia is, I assume.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOOK: Yes. 'Mv honoýuriable friend might corne out to British
Columbia. In this Bill there is, I notice,
pne clause which refers to a fax on
Vobacco grown by the farmer. The duty
on any kind of tobacco that is grown in
COanada for home consumption is five
cents per pound. There are variou6 quaiities of tobacco grown and there is a question whether it would not have been ad-visable for t~he Government to consider
the grading of the tax.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGMEED: It wouid
noV be practicable.
,Hon. Mjr. BOISTIOOK: It seems that the
Vax fails a good deal more heavily on the
,rnan growing thie lower grade -if *"b1acco
than on the person who grow6 a high
grade.
-Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: One can
ibe grown just as cheaply as the other.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOOK: But the Vax does
not fah as heavily on the man who grows
a high grade of tobacco.
My honourable friend has referred Vo the
revenue that will 'be obtained by this Vax.
Re has stated that the total amount f hat
-thetlovernment h-opes to obtain from it will
be about S9,000,000. The Government may
obtain thlat amount, or- they may flot.*
Sometirnes when taxes are increased, the
effect is to decrease Vhe revenue Výosome
extent. Unfortunately this tax will not
mean an increase in exci4se revenue Vo the
Government, because the revenue derived
Iast
year
from
excise
duty
on
suclb
products
.spirits,
malt
-and
amounted to $12,000,000, and now, I presurne, since prohibition bas been adopted.
the Government will lose that revenue.
Therefore, even if they obt-ain an increase
of $9,000,000 from this Vax, there will stili
be $3,000,000 less revenue than w~as obtained
last year. IV looks as if the person who
ind-ulges in tobacco wili be required to makze
up for the loss of revenue on spirits, malt,
and such tbings.
This is a direct Vax. The Vax is on s0
many clgars, so anany cigarettes, so many
pounds of tobacco. I -%vould like Vo ask
my honourable friend if if bas been con9idered whetber a Vax could noV have been,
placed on the value of the Vobacco. It migbt
fail more fair]y on the people.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOISGHEED: The imposition of excise duties bas been carried
out under the present system for a great
number of years, and the increasing of the
duty under the present systemn is very muchi
more practicable and better understood
than resorting- Vo newï methods of taxation.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: I wculd point out'
that this tax opens up a new field of
speculation, which wouid not be altogether
dishonsest. There la an increase of $3 a
thousand on cigars. What is to prevent
the consumer fromn requiring the manufacturer to make bis cigar twice its present
size? The longer cigar would be a sufficient
simoke for a wbole day. By doubiing tbe
lengtli of the cigars the man reduces bis
tax by $1.50 a Vbousand. Some cigars are
just the size of your smali fing-er; some are
the size of your second finger, and others
the size of your third finger. What is Vo
prevent the manufacturer, wbo will have Vo
pay $3 extra per thousand, from making
t hree smali cigars into one cigar?
Hon. Mr. POWVER: That is a valuable
suggestion.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: You will find that
the manufacturer will bave recourse to tbis
nietbod of saving money; and saving nîoney
in war time is no crime. A poor man who
to-day pays five cents for his cigar will Vomiorrow be required Vo pay ten cents for
the same brand. He says Vo the manufacturer, "Make me a cigar that wvi]l contain two of the old ones and I will psy ten
cents." In that way hie escapes the tax.
The proposai Io put a fax on the number
and on the weight is noV a fair one. Why
shouid the poor man pay $3 extra on a
thousand cig-ars, worth only $5 a bundred,
wben bis nieighbour across the road, who
smokes cigars worth 10, 15 or 2_5
cents e.ach,
will have Vo psy only 83 extra on the
t11ousand?ý Thle thing does noV resuit in
fair desling.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I wouid
point out to iiy bonourable friend that on
foreign-nmade cigars there is an import duty,
bssed on %veigbt, and then of course there
is the excise duty, based on weight, on
domestic tobacco used for cigars. So the
manufacturer will noV be able f0 Vakze advantage of the very ingenious suggestion
made by iny honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: \Vhy can lie noV'
Why can the manufacturer noV make his

fifteen cents. It would be very easy to
make two cigars like this into one. I amn
s'imply throwing out a suggestion so that

plieric nitrogen for use as a fertilizer, and also
in the manufacture of explosives for militarv
use9

-Hon. Mr. LOUGHEED:
1. No direct steps have been taken by
the Governmnent towards the encouragement of the production of mixed or comipounded fertilizers 'by the fertilizer manufact'urer, as it did not appear to be nece 'sary, the industry being keenly alive as te
the increased demand for fertilizers. Exnbargoes have been placed upon the export
of wood ashes, a Canadian source of potash,
and upon sulphate of ammonia, a valuable
nitrogenous fertilizer produced in considerable quantities in Canada. An investigation was carrîed on in Nova Sootia to ascertain the possîbility of preparing a useful
fertilizer 'by the drying and grinding of
sea weed, with satisfactory results. Though
not a concentrated product, and, therefore,
flot one that would stand heavy transportation charges, it bas been proved a valuable material for supplying two of the
essential olements of fertility-nitrogen and
potash. For the past two seasons it has
been under field trial, espeoially in the
Maritime Provinces.
The experimental farmn system, through
the division of chemistry, has on a large
nuinher of its branch farms and stations
throughout the Dominion, carried on iiivestigatory work with fertilizers, and the
practical results and conclusions therefrom
have been given wide distribution by means
of reports, bulletins, etc. In addition, the
division of chemîstry conducts a very largeý
correspondence with farmers on the value
and legitimate, eiconomic use of fertilizerq.
Special arrangements were made towards
facilitating and hastening the carrying of
fertilizers by the railroads..
2. The Government have been instrumental in having processes for the manufacture of atmospheric nitrogen investig-ated,
but no arrangements have so far been made
for

its

manufacture.

DLSOUJSSIN AND I-NQTYIRY.Hon. W-M. DENNIS rose in aocordance
with the following notice:

TIhat he will cali the attention of the Senate
to the cost of reportlng and publishing the
Senate Debates, and inquire if it is the intention of the honourable the leader of the House
to take s.ny action wlth the view te discontlnuing the offilai reporting and publishing

thereof.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, about
il o'clock every forenoon there is placed in
the post office box of each member an
-"unrevised" copy of the official. report of
the debates of the Senate.
This is a

verbatim report oîf every word uttered on
the floor of thie Hou"e by honourable ariern-

bers, whether set speeches prepared with
the utmost care after exhaustive investigcation and profound thought, ordinary impromptu talk on ordinary measures, hot
and hasty words uttered on the spur of the
moment and forever afterwards te be
regretted, or the most trivial, petty and
irrelevant talk-every word uttered appears
in the printed report, is embalmed for time
and eternity, and thus becomnes "historical." And incidentally I may mention
that many of the ideas expounded by
honourible menibers, and sernetimes much
of the exact language used by the same
honourable members, may be found on the
pages o! this precious volume three or four
or six or eight times, according to the
number of speeches made on the same
subject in the committee stage and on the
second and third readings of any measure
before the House. These verbatim reports
are- made by a staff of expert stenographiers,
amanuenses, editors, typesetters, proofreaders-to whose particular werk I will refer

1 ar n ot now questioning the wisdomn or

otherwise of printing the debates of this

".records and journals- of Parliament
shal 'be -print-ed in .both languages.
For the firat five years of the life
of this boneurable House there was no
officiai report of the debates, printed or
otherwise. It was net until 1871 that the
officiai Hansard was established. Previons
to, that date t1he only record of- the speeches
wvas tbrough the newspapers, andi it

is a

significant tact that haif a century ago, and
for the first decade or two of its existence,
the newspapers gave two or Vthree times the

attention, sqaoe and prominence te the discussions and proceedings of the 6enûte -that
they giv-e to-day; sand 1 direct the careful
attention of honourabie grentlemen te 4,hat
significant fac't. As I have stated, the only
reports o! t)he debates o! the Senate during
the first five years ef its histery -were the
reports which appeared in the newapapers.
A contract for a stenographic officiai report
%vas awarded te the brothers Hoiland in
1871, and the coutract system continued up
te two years a-go, when the present systemn
of a permanent staff of reporters was established. In this cennoction. I may point eut
that whiie these expert gentlemen are empioyed as permanent officiais and paid acnerding te their class annual salaries and
th«eir Whoie time is at the command o! the
House should the session last ten or twelve
mionths, as a matter o! fact the officiai reporters are empleyed enly whiie Parliament is in session, and this year they wiiI
only be emp]oyed ten of the fifty-two weeks
for which they are paid saiary. I admit
that these are ten strenueus weelks, and it
is net the fault of the very efficient and exp-ert gentlemen -%ho constitute the staff that
t'hey are net employed the rest of the year.
That is due to -the action of the Senate in
eniploying them and confining their services
te one particular line e! duty instead o! the
Governiment empioying t.hem for general

work that these gentlemen could do, ithout extra cost if there was a Bureau of
Reporting for a]! gevernient \werk, as there
should be; and tiîus co-ordinaii;m, ce-operation, efficiency and econorny could be
enforced. That, however, is a subject whichi
I hope Io cal! attention to on a convenient
date after the information called for by
this honourable House has been brought
down.
As I said, the Sen.ate Hansard was established in 1871, and this honourable Houêe
jogged along for a third of a century with
the EngIish edition. In 1904 it wvas found
advisable to expend 810,000 a year in
printing -an edition of 100 copies of an
official report in the French language, and
five years later the examp1e thus set by
the Senate was followed by the House of
Commons--of course, at a proportionately
increased expense. While I am flot at this
time questioning the wisdom oýfpublishing
the debates in both languages according to
present custom, if we are going to continue
this enormous, and to a large extent, as
I think, uselesel expenôe for any officiai
report, I want to em.phasize the fact that
after everything that is said by honourable
mnembers, whether important speeches or
trivial remarks, has been reported, edited,
typewritten, set in type, stereotyped, 2,000
copies printed in E.glish, and carefully or otherwise read by every bonourable cgent'em an who has thep leisure

but only 400 distributed, leaving 300

An expenditure of say $330

for each bound volume-the most expencsive
editien de luxe bocks in the *weorld ! And,
if it is in order, I may be permitted to say
that the cost of the Senate Hansard is
only a fifth, or perhaps one-quartýer, cf the
cet cf the Commnons Hans-ard. But that
is a matter over wvhich we have ne control
and on which we niay flot express an
o)pinlion.
Lest anycne should question the .accuracy
of the figures which I have mentioned as the
cost of the Senate -Hansard, 1 will -ive the
details of the expenditure for the last session, which I am f.rank te say is larger
than- the average because it was the session
that preceded the election, and honourable
gentlemen natural]y took advantage cf the
opportunity to make frequent and len.gthy
speeches with the assurance that they
would appear in Hansard, and with the
erroneous idea that they .-would thereby
get to the country. In round figures the
cost of reporting, editing and type'writing
was $11,000; translation into French,
$5,000; and the amoun4rt charged by the
Bureau for prin.ting, etc., wvas $17,000-total, $33,000. The cost of prin.ting was for
labour anad material alone and did not include interest on capital or overhead expenses. In previeus years the ccst ran
from $20,000 upwards. But the principle is
the saine. The cest cf prirrting the 2,600 or
2,700 copies in English and bin.ddng 700 into
volumes exceeded $10,000, while the cest of
printing the forty-five IIunrevised"I copies
in French fer daily distribution-that is,
four or five w'eeks late-Nwaýs $4.500., or
equivalent to $100 a copy for the session.
I have not the figures of cest cf iczsuing
the, fifty bound volumes cf the "revised"I
edition in French, because that edition,
nowN

iMy opinion is that a Senate Hansard is
ne longer necessary, that its centinued punblication i.: a-n uiînustifia>le expense-a wvaste

with the prorogation of t.his session; thiat
the Senate sheuld make mutually satilsfactory arrang-ements for the retiremient or

been a faithful and efficient officiai cf Parliament for a third cf a century; and that
the Govermnent be asked te utilize as iuay

The work cf the printing deparrtmient,
especially in the proofreading cf the Senate
debates, is more than unsatisfactory: it ia
a disgrace to thie departmnent. I do flot
want te weary the Senate with details, but
let me give you a few samples cf the kind
cf work turned eut hby the Government
Printing Bureau. Though the copy is ahl
typewritten and carefully edited, gross
errers are made in the debates as printed,
whîch net only spoil the sense cf an honourable member's speech, but frequently
make it nensensical-as was the case of the
printed report cf a speech a few days ago
by the honeurable senier senator fro-m Halifax, which represented him. as saying the
exact opposite cf what he actually did say.
The honeurable senator frein Toronto, mn
his remarks on trading in Geiman goeds,
mentioned a sumn of £80,000,000.
The intelligent proofreader changed it into $80,O0,000-a difference cf a mere bagatelle cf
$3W.,000,O00. The printed debates contain
frequent gross departures from the plainly
typewritt,en "«ccpy," and there are innuxnerable typegraphical errers-errers cf

wha±.ever to dictate terms of any description to the memhprs of the Htouse of Gommons with regard to their own domestic
affairs. It is an interference which at least
is injudicious -and which I arn sure would
be considered obnoxious by the House of
Comnmon s.
The Bill is uncoilstitutiý>i-aI because it
desis with money matters. It piiovides flot
only for a diminution in the paymient of
public rnoney to the Senate, but at the
same time proposes an increase in the
expenditure of public money. We are al
settled on the point that wve have no
right, constitutional or lotherwvise, to increase expenditure. For a number of years
we have claimed our right to dinîiinish expenses, a dlaim which has been very
tho-roughly put before the Senate and the
country in the report regarding- the powers,
rights and privileges of the Senate, brought
down by the honoura:ble gentleman from
Middleton (lion. W. B. Ross).
The provision in this Bill whîch increases
the expenditute would -ive a senator $20
per day under certain conditions, whereas
under present conditions he is allk>wed
only $10 or $15. On that point I call the attention of the Speaker ta the fact that this
is a money Bill in the full sense of the
term. Although it is a very pîcayune,
cheese-paring matter, a principle is at
stake. Wh-at rigaht have we in this House
to tell the Hiouse of Gommons how they
shahl regulate their indemnity? To my mind
it is-I was going to say impertinent, and
members of the House of Gommons would
treat it as such. So that on both points,
the character of the Bill and its nature, it
ought not to be pre.ssed at the present juncture. I think the honourable the senior member from Halifax would be well advised in
withdrawing it. Under the circumstances
1 ssk the decision of the Speaker as to
wvhether this Bill is constitutional from the
financial point of view -and whether or not
it is regular, as being against the riglits o f
the other House.
Hon. Mr. POWER: Honourable g-entlemen, I think it is to be regretted Ilhat the
honourabie gentleman from the Victoria
division (Hon. Mr. Cloran), whcen a-tacking
this little measure, did not keep Iimiiself
within the hines of the fscts. There is no
proposai in this Bill to increase ilhe indemnity from $20 to $30 a memiber. The
Act which the Bill proposes to amenid says:
A mexnber shall not be entitled to the said
sessional allowanoe for less than tbirty-one
days' attendance; but his allowance for anY

IS-37
REVISED

less number of days shall be twen.ty dollars for
each day's attendance.

The Bill itself says:
A member shal flot be entitled ta the said
sessional allowance for lesm than thirty-one
days' actual attendance; but bis allowance for
any less number of days shall be twenty dollars
for each day's attendance.

The amount ia identical with thait mentioned in chapter 10 of the Revised ;Statute6.
The only change made ià that the word
",actual" is inseçted before "attendance."
This House unanimously the other day
adopted the report submitted by the honourable gentleman from Mîddleton (Hon, W.
B. Ross) dealing with the rights of the
Senate in connection with money Bis.
However, I do not piropose to rest on that
decision, which would remove ail doubt as
to our right to pass thîs Bihf; but I would
call attention to Bourinot, on page 492:
Many other ent1ges wll! be found of the
House accepting Senate amendments rather than
delay tbe passage of a Bill at an advanced
period of thesession. It le quite regular. however, to agree to aznendments which "affeét
charges upon the people Incidentally only, and
have flot been mnade wlth that object."

This Bill affects the money question only
incidentally, and there waa no intention of
.doing more than ",ht. We are continnaliy
passing Bis that affect the revenue in a
slight degree. This Bill does flot propose
to lay any charge on the public. As far
as it goes., if it were enacted, it wouId have
the effeot of reducing the charge, although
that wouid be only incidentai Io the
adoption of the principle of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANIE*L: 1 think that, as
morst of us have net before us a oopy of
the Revieed Statutes, the honjourabie the
senior snember from Halifax should explain exactly what changes wouId be effected in t4he pre.sent law if the Bill which he
introduces were pa.ssed. He should state,
for instance, -%vhether the nirmber of days
a senator is permitted to be absent before
any deduction is made from. the total inidemn.ity will be greater or ],ess. I think we
are entitled to know exactiy what changes
thie amendment, if passed, will rnake in
the present condition of affaira.
Hon. Mr. POWER.- That -was what 1
proposed to do, but I have beein heïaded
off by the question of order raised by f)e
honourable gentleman from the Victoria
division (Hon. Mr. Cloran), and of course
the Bill cannot be proceeded with until
that question lias been disposed of.

SENATE
Hlon. WV. ROSS: If I understand the
B.
objection raised by the honourable gentlemani frein Victoria with respect to this Bill,
1 do nlot think it is well founded. In the
first place, ini applying te the Bill the supreme test to as-certain whether it is a
nîo-ney Bill or not, vou have te inquire
whether it proposes to lay some new burden
on the people or net. If I umderstand this
Bill, it does not propose to do anything of
the kind. Provision is already made for
the payrnent of indemnities or salaries, or
whatever you choose te cali them, te the
mernbers of the House of Com.mons and the
merihers of the Senate, and ail that this
Bill would -do is te effect, so te spesak, a redistribution of those indemnities. So it is
quite within the functions of Parliament.
Apa.rt altogether from the question of money
Bills, it ie in no sense an invasion of
the rights and privilege6 of the House of
Gommons or the rights and privileges of
this House. I cannot agree with the honeurable meruber from Victoria on the point of
order. The question o! whether we ehali
adopt the Bill on its merits or nlot would
of course have te corne up for discussion
after the point of order is determined. I
would like the honourable gentleman froin
Victoria division to point out where ans'
new burden is laid on the people of Canada
by this Bill.

$20. Whether the prescrnt deduction o! $15
a day cornes out of the indemnity due to
the member or not does not do away with
the contention that t-he allowance of $20
a day in an increas-ed. expeinditure, rthere is
not the slightest doubt cf il in rny mind.
Thc indemnity ie voted for a purpose and
on one condition: that yon attend every
sitting of the Senate or the House o! Coinmons, less fifteen days' grace. For every
day you are absent in addition to those
fifteen you are .taxed $15. How the honourable senior member for Halifax bring"s
forward a provision that the paymnent
shall be $20. If that is nlot an increase, I
would àike 'to know what that is?
Hon. Mr. POWER: Thei-e is no such
provision in the Bill.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: One provision in
the Bui -is for an increase of pay. Anyhow,
I arn net laying sO much stress on that. My
point is that it is a bad precedent for us
here te interfere wîth the domestic regulatiens of the House o! Gommons. On that
ground alone, so as net te make the House
of Commons more hostile te this body than
it is at present, the Bil1 should net be
proceeded with. I think that is a propen
ground te take. What is the use cf increasing the hostility of the Commeners or the
country at large against this bedy, which
Hon. Mr. CL.ORAN: 0f course, opinionê is already defu.nct, in the opinion cf many

attended every day that the Senate was

ho would not receive tihe indemnity for the

gentlemen in the other Hanse received

the indemnity ap.ply only ta actual sitting

in that way senators would be put in a

thing about this Bill strikes me as being
rather peculiar, and does not seem altogether fair. Take the present session: this
is the 33rd sitting, or the 34t.h; let us -suppose that we will have in. ail 38 sittings, as
prorogation is spoken of for neict Thursday. A senator is, present at thixty-one oi
these sititings and àis therefore entitled to
the sessional allowance, less $15 per day
for those seven daya upon which he was
absent. That will result in that member
receiving the sum of $2,396, made up of
$2,500 -lesm $105. By the provisions of this
Bill a member who has attendedt only thirty
days would receive, $600. In t.he.r words,
a senatai, who was present thiirty-one days,
would, receive $2,3%e, but one 'who was
present thirty days vould receive only $600.
That would flot seem lair.

House ýta decide whether it wvas a proper
Bill te be before this House. I would have
liked ta have had bis opinion on that
matter; it would have strengthened the
views of the members here in regard ta the
nature of the Bill, which is calculated ta
da harni to this honaurable Hause in the
Hause of Commons. On these grounds 1
think the Bill shouid flot receive its second
reading, and if 1 can get a seconder I shall
mave the six months hojat. The honourable
mnember for Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Dûssaulles) will tsecond the motion. It is net a
premeditated plot.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I quite sympathize
with the ideas and motives of the honourable memiber who has introduced t'his Bill.
At the samne time, I must say that I do flot
feel like voting for it at this late date in
the session, when we really have flot
sufficient time to look into the matter
thoroughiy. It is no doubt a grievance te
thoE>e who are here and wbo stay ail session
that a nurnber of the members of this
House absent Vhemselves during, a very.
large part of the session and 'are flot
mulcted ta any great extent on that account.
At the saie time, we have te remember
that we occasionally have a session in
Ottawa-last session was one of themwhen, if a member attended. every day and
were paid at the rate of $10 -a day the whole
indemanit y would 'be exhausted, and, I think,
on somne occasions something more. I
think that we might well have an opportunity te pondýer over this Bili during the
recess, and it may be that some other
method of inflicting financial punishment,
without -oing as far as this Bill goes, will
be dis-covered. In thinking casually cf the
miatter, it struck me -that perhaps a good.
way ta deai with it-at ail events, another
way-wvould be te pay to a member
an amoiint wvhich would bear the samne
ratio ta lthe iotal indemnity as the number
cf the days lio was present would bear ta
the total inhiier cf days of the session.
Suppose ilhere were a lorty-day session and
a meier altended only ten days, hie
wouid be entitled to one-quarter of the total
indemnity. I think something mîght be
worked out whicli would be mare easily
adjustable thian the method provided in
the Bill w~hich is before us.
As I have said, I think there is a grîevance, and I think perhaps it is the duty cf
this Chaniber ta endeavor te reniedy it;
but as Nv expect te prorogue within two or
three days. I think it would be foolish for
us te imagine. even if we .passed it thatthis Biii Ivoil1d receive any consideration

mien, I would consider it proper ta vote
for the Bill if it were amended in such a
way as te meet the objections of the honourable gentleman tromn St. John (Han. Mr.
Daniel) and the honourable member froim
Halifax (Hon. Mr. Crosby). I think the
objections are very serious. The objeot of
the Bill is a very goed one. There is ne
deubt tha-t ine law is abused. There are
cases in which. the provisione cg the Bill
would be in tiue interest cf the country.
The honourabie gentleman fromn Halifax
(Hon. Mr. Crosby) asked what wouid
happen if Parliament sat forty days, and
during those forty days the Senate, alter
the opening, adjourned for two weeks,
because there was ne work before it. The
members of 'the other House would be paid
their full indemnity, but the members cf
titis House would lose their indemnity
through ne fault cf their own.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: If the honeurable
gentfleman from St. John (Hon. Mr. Daniel)
wvill move an amendment te the amendment, I shahl be very pleased te second it.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: Move mine straight.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: I always try te go
straight. From the time that Parliament
is summoned-and I want the lawyers te
listen te this, as At may help themn semee
time-until it is proragued, or dissolved the
House is in, session. If the Senate discovers
that it has net work for to-day, to-mo-rrow,
or the next day, would it be wise or necess-ary for us ta come here and look at one
another a.nd listen to my honourable friend
froni Victoria, or would it be better ta
adjourn for twe or three days? The honourable senior member for Halifax says, "«Yes,
let us sit- every day." Well, hie must like
to look at us, or I cann-ot understand bis
reasening. There is a great deai dn the contention cf niy honourable lriend, but I
think it is rather late in the day te bring
in such a Bill. I thin.k the euggestion cf
the honou-rable gentleman fromn St. John
is a good one, that we should be allowed
ta consider this matter during the recess,
and we could then take it up and go into it
thoroughly whien we come back, as I trust
God will permit us ail te do.

thiing to do when 'there is no work coming

There is also the very important principle
of economy that must be considered by t.he

I allude. It seemis to nie that the broad general principle whiceh 1 have outlined in a

0! course, it is a very radical reforin,
particularly in Canada, where we have b-een
accustomed fo-r so many years to what is
known as political patronage. But it. seems
to me, from the experience of other countries in placing the publie service under
a commission, that members of Parliament
particularly may appreciate the advantage
which is bound to qarise from this reform.
This measure, in a senzze, must be largely
experimeLt.al.
The whole scheme must

Bill.

vice hie iiiay look forward to rising te the
top o! the .tree according to his professional
ability and lus services te the country, and
îîîav feel that menit will secure his advancenient. Unfortunately, however, I fear that
tixat condition o! t.hings lias not been
arnived at iii the admîinistration of the Act
thiat is on our statute book to-day.
The administration o! the Civil Service
under the control of Commissioners will
very largely depend on bow those Commissioners interpret the Act, and on their
ideas of what the administration of the Act
should be. The preseut, m£asure may be an
atteipt, ini the right direction, and I think
it is; but I very niucli fear that, unless the
Comnisaion has very etrong- support fTom
the $Govýernmen-t o! the day, whatever Gevernment it may be, there will be great difficulty in living up to the ideal of doing away
witb <patronage and partisanab.ip in the Civil
Service. We ail know that on the change
of Government in 1911 a number o! things
were done that were flot considered to be
conducive te the removal of patronage iu
the Civil Service. The view of the mernbers
of the Government who came into power
in that year apparently was that in certain
wsys their influence and their opportunity
for mianaging the affairs of the country were
interfered with Iby the tact that th2 men
at the head oft he departments were not
in sympathy with them in their political
views; and in a number of instances they
were apparently afraid that those men
would nott work in &uch close cooperation
wit-h them as they desired; hence certain
changes and rules were made for -the purpoze of overcoming what 1 suppose they concidered waÀs a difficulty. -The saine thing
niay arise even under this Acf. as it is
iîîtroduced to-day. Its administration wili
depend entirely on the view taken of it by
thie Government and the intention ot te
Cerniniissioners.

he other day 1 received a letter from

MAY 20, 1918

he had applied to the Commissionnera for
an appointment in the Outside Service,
and thaît he thad given the names of two
gentlemen who vouched for bnis respectability and bnis character. 0f course, if
the Commissionnera of the Civil Service
have to apply to the men whose names are
dlown on this, paper -as reconimending the
particular applicant, unless they are very
careful the resuif, w-ill be exactly, the same as
it is at present; because the Commissioners
in Ottawa cannot possibly have information
as to a man out in British Columbia; they
cainnot know that man's qualifications;
therefore naturally tbey have to apply to
Gome one whom the applioant may mention
as knowing him. The only difference I
can see between that -arrangement and what
we have to-day would be that possibly the
applicant m'ight not mention the member
representing the district, or lie might; and
if lie mentioned the local member as the
one best acquainted witih him, and Who
would .speak as to bis. character and capability for fi]ling the position, the situation
would be just about the same as it is today. When the Comission received the
paper making the statement as to the man's
capability they would naturally want to
know whether that statement was correct,
and they would apply to the member, because his name was inentioned in the
paper; therefore, the system would be
practically what it is now. 0f course, the
Commission would, 1 presume, 'be at liberty
to apply to some one else as well if they
thought that the member's recommendation
was net sùfficient, but the chances are
that in order to save time they would not
go any further t'han take the -member's
recommendation. 1 cannet see how they
are going te get over the difficulty, afld
in that case I do flot anticipate very much
improvement in the condition of things
which the Government hopes to bring about
by this Bill.
Another point to which I direct attention
is the condition of inatters in Canada today arising fxorn the number of Commissions appointed by the Dominion Government. The condition la very unsatisfactory to the members of the Civil Service,
who have a just cause of complaint, as I
think the Government themsîves mnust
realdse, arising from the fact that at present
a large num-ber of people who are working
on those Commissions are drawing higher
salaries than are paidtothe regular memElers
of the Civil Service. Men who have given
the beet years of their life and their best
work too the country ses people brought in
from the outside and placed on those commissions, doing work that ic, fot of any

581

gre-ater importance to the country ithan
their own, or even of equai importance with
that of Lh regular members of the Civil
Service, and yet being paid higher salaries.
I think that the policy thst has been pursued of appeinting this large number of
commissions is not a good one, and is flot
!air to the members of the regular Civil
Service. As I understand the position today, if a man is -wanted in a department
to 1111 a position, application is mnade to
the comnmissionere, and they rnake a recommnendation stating that ao-and-so bas
passed the examination andl is qualifie1 to
fill 1,he position and to be placed in a certain class; and the department to 'which
that man or woman goes must put him
or ber in that position and pay the salary
aocording to the scals. They are absolutely
tied down by that systsm. But if the same
man or woman is appointed to a commission, the question is left sntirely to the
Governor in Council to eay what salary
shs.ll be paid andl practically what clams
the appointee shail be put into. The consequence is that very often the eniployees
o! a commission. are paid a higher salary
than a main or wvcman a.ppointed to the
Civil. 'Service. This dos not conduoe to
contentmen-t ooe the bringing about of aitisfactory cand good work in the Civil Service, for 'the members of the regular service leel that they are not being fairly
treated. Possibly this point may not have
been brought to the attention of the Government in the stress of work to which the
Government bas to attend in connection
with the war and thus they may net
realize the effecta of this method on the
Civil Service of the country.
Other matteris regarding this Bill may be
,disgcusssd better ini oommittee, sand I understand from *my honourable friend, that
honourable memnbers who are flot here teday will be given full opportunity for discussion.

ing the Canadian Northern Railway System.
iHon. Sir James Lougaheed.
SPECIAL WVAR REVENUE'BILL.
SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
second reading of Bill 83, an Act t-o amend.
the Speeial War Revenue Act, 1915.
He said: This is purely a revenue Bil.
Ilt proposes increasing the public revenues
from the different articles set eut in the Bill
by the amounit therein. mentioned. For the
information of the House 1 may particularize a littie more. Section 1, as honourable gentlemen will observe, provides for
an increase in the tax payable on a berth
in a sleeping-car and a seat in a parlour-car.
The increase in the formeS case is from 10
cents on each berth to 10 per cent of the
prîce of each birth, but in no case is 'the
tax to be less than 25 cents. In respect of
the latter, the increase is froin 5 cents for
each seat to 10 cents for each seat. By the
imposition of this tax it is estimated that
the revenue will be increased by $130,000.
Section 2 is simply an amendment to existing legislation, and is jntended îto correct
an interpretation which has been placed
upon the Act in the province of Quebec,
by wbich the Act is ito a certain extent
evaded. It bas been held by the judicial
authorities of that province that the tax
is only applicable when a consumer purchases the medicine. 0f course, it is intended that the tax should be applicable
to ail sales of the article, no matter whether
purchased by the consumer or by some one
reprasenting him.
Hon. Mr. POWER: If the tax is paid
when the article is sold by a druggist, then
it bas to be paid again.
HÈon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The point
is that the person purchasing it might not
be the actual consumer, but migbt be pur.
chasingu for a customer.
Seotion 3 proposes an imposition o! a war
excise tax on matches and playing cards.
It is estimated that $3,000,000 will be realizable out o! the additieonal tax which. is
being placed upon matches. Apparen-tly it
has always been difficuit in Great Britain
and else-where, ta carry out. successfully a
tax upon matches. I remember reading
some time ago a memoir of the late Lord
Sherbrooke, wha was Sir Robert Lowe,
Chancellor -of the Exohequer in the Gladstone admnistration. The British acininistrations had tried, I think on two or three
different occasions, ta collect a ta'x on
matches, but found public opinion so
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHE.

opposed ta it that for the time being they
abandoned the tax. On thia particular ccasion Mr. Gladstone, being in need of
revenue, imposed su-eh a tax. It was proposed to place upon each box of matches
a stamp with the Latin maxim "Ex luce
The Bryant and May people
lucellum."~
organized a great mov'ement, and thouoands
o! vehicles laden with women and girls,
employees of the factory, Etormed Westminster, and Sir Robert Lowe had ta be
smuggle d into the House. The public press
shortly afterwards came out with this àttlte
squib ridiculing the tax:
Ex luce lucellum.
Of course, we all know;
But If Lucy don't seil 'em,
What then. Mr. Lowe?

Eventually the tax had to be withdrawn.
I hope, honourable gentlemen, that we may.
be more successful in collecting the tax proposed in, thia Bill.
We are imposing -a tax of 8 cents a
package on playing cards. lIt is es-timated
tihat $200l,000 will be collected by this tax.
Proceeding ta part IV of the Bill, it is
proposed ta levy a tax upon articles therein
graphophones,

$5,000,000 will be c-ollected fromn the tax on
automobiles, and $250,000 from the tax on
graphophones and other italking machines.
Of course, that does no't include Parliament.
On articles commonly and commercially
known as jewelry it is estimated that $200,000 will be «collected.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Honourable gentlemen, we quite realize t-bat the tiovernment

stteiment. 1 submit t.hat the power of

as an essential part of the Confederation

to which it was enjoyed by the House of
Lords, and more. Of course, other conclusions niay be droewvn by taking the Act
literally, but rny conclusion, I submit, is
the riht one.
4. That the Senate in the past has repeatedly
arnended so-called Maney Bis, in some cases
without protest frorn the Commons, while in
other cases the Bis were allowed to pass, the
Commans protesting or ciaimlng that the Senate
could flot ainend a Money Bill.

When those Bis were passed without
protest it was at the end of the session and
in matters that were pressing or unimportant; but the Conîmons have neyer
divested themeselves voluntarily of the
excluziv, right nlot oniy of initiating Money
Bis, but aiso of amending thern, and with
the exception of a few that in the rush of
the dying hours of the session were nlot protested, ail the amendmnents that they accepted from us were accepted conditionaliy,
under protest.
5. That Rule 78 of the House of Commons of
Canada claiming for that body powers and privileges ln connectbon with Money Bills identical

We miust no-t for-

get that we are an aritiquated body, rnuch
more an.tiquated than the House of Lords,
who have a root in hisQt.ory, wliereas we
have not. The provinces have, and have
had, nothing et all to do withi our appointment. In, tact, honourable gentlemen, if
the Government wished te appoint as senators for Quebec, or for New Brunswick,
the province Vo -mhich 1 am prend to belong,
twenty-four mnen now residing in the far
West, there is nothing te prevenit thean froi
doing so. The only requirenient would 'be
the property qualification. No governiment
would do such a thing, but 1 am just giving
an instance. Who would dare to s.ay that
thece twenty-four cenators represented. the
province of Quehec? The provincial legisI.atures or the people of the provinces have
had nothring to do with our appointment.

Hon. Mr. POIRIER: 0f course, that condition would be imposed. But a man freim
the honourable genîtleman's province (British Columbia) or the province of the honourable leader of the <hoverrnment (Alberta) would simrply have Vo take his houseihold gods wîth him. buy sortie property in
Quebec and live t.here. That, is ail 'that is
necessary, and $,lhe requirement is no-t very
strict at that. We know some of our colleagues who, live, for only one or two monthis
of the year ini the province thev represent,
and for the rest of the tinie live outside
of that province. There is nothing in the
constitution directly stating that, senators
have to safeguard the provinees .they repreisent. 0f course, all t-hat is inmplied. but no
more; and, I repeat, the difference between
u6c and the various -overn.mnents nentioned
un, this lengthy report 'is that we do not,
come at any time -in touch with the people,
and that xnoney matters ere essen-tially
zanatters of the people. That is -wlh it is
that we should keep aloof aS inuch as Po,--sible frorn those disturbing questions.
No-w 1 corne Vo paragraph 7 of lie report:
7. That besides general legislat ion. there are
questions such as provincial subsidies. public
lands in the western provinces and the rlghts
of the provinces in connection with pending
rallway legislation and the adjustment off the
rights off the provinces thereunder likely to
arlee at any time, and it ls important that the
powers off the Senate relating thereto be
thoroughly understood.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER.

Till then that House had constltutionally coordinate powers wlth the House or Comnions in
'Money BUis" as In ail Bills and hud neyer
formally abandoned themn except as to orIgînating Money Bis.

That is a mookted question that was never
settled. The Lords propounded, the Coinnions denied; and you know what happened.
The resolution of 1910 by Asquith settled
the quest'ion by telling the Lords t.hat their
power expired at thie threshold of the House
of Comnmons, and does flot in faiet exist in
those natteré.

Lord Derby In 1861 clearly showed that the
Lords had neyer formally abandoned ats rights
to amend "Money Bills."
But that does not prove that they had
those rigahts. A rigaht should be uncontest4ed.
What we are after is a clear right. The
memnorandum Baya:
in 1671 the Commons affirmed that "in ail
aids given to the King by the Commons the rate
or tax ought flot to be altered by the Lords."
That state of thing2s existed -~ century, 1
may say, before it was put down in
writing; but because it 'was not put down
in writing before 1671 it would be preinature to infer that it did no-t exist. We must
not take, as accruing Vo us, that which is
not specifically written as against us.

Revenue Act, 1915.-(Hon.
Lougheed).
NAVIGABLE WATERS PROTEýCTION ACT
AMENDMENT BILL.
CONSIDERE-D

IN COMMITTEE.-THIRD
READING.

The Senate again went into Committee
on Bill 41, An Act to amend the Navigable
Waters Protleetion Act.-Hon. Sir James
Loughieed. Hon. Mr. Blain in the Chair.
On section 1--definition of "work":
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Honourable gentlemen, when we were last in coinmittee, section l. was under disýcucsion. and

MAY 21, 191852
the opinion was advanced that dekegating
eit.her to the Minister of Public Works or
to the Governor in Council the question of
det.ermining what might interfere with
navigation would practically exclude the
intervention of the courts in the event of
the opinion of the minister or of the Governor in Council being questioned on appeul. To remove any doubt of that kind I
propose that the section as it appears in
the printed Bill be amended in the following way: That the words "«in the
opinion of the Minister of Public Works,in lines 13 and 14, be stricken out, so that
it would read:
Whether similar In character to the foregoing
or mot, which may interfere with navigation.

That amendment will leave the law as it
'stands at the present time as to the determin-ation of what constitutes, navigation,
either by the Governor in Council or the
court or whatever other authority may
be called upon to decide. I therefore moî'e
that thirose words be stricken out and that
the clause be adopted as a.mended.
Hon. '-%r. BOSTOCK: I understand that
by the amendaient the law will be left
The quesvery much as it is at present.
tion will be for the Governor in Council to
decide?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No. The
amendment does not include in the Bill
the factor of the Governor iii Council determining what may' interfere 'with navigation. That is -an open, question.
Il-on. Mr. BOSTOCK: How is that question to be decided, then? By application to
the courts for a decision?
Hon. Sir JA'MES LOUGHEED: No. If
the Governor in Council should make a
ruling thaï, a certain work should not be
consiruct-ed, the question wîll be open for
the intervention of the courts if the courts
are invoked; but the objection which was
raised to the construction of the clause
when it was undeT consideration some days
ago %vas that the opinion of t.he Minister
oJ Public Works or of the Governor in
Council, as the case mighlt be, deterrnined
what constituted navigaation. and therefore
the question was not appealable.
The arnendrnent of Hon. Sir James Lougheed was ag-reed to, and section 1 as amended, wvas agreed to.
On section 2-new section 4, subsection
1--construction of work in navigable works
subject to -approval:,

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I propose that we strik-e out the words "upon.
the Tecommendation of the Minister of
Public Works," in lines 21 and 22.
Hon. Mr. BOSTO4CK: I see no objection
to that, but I do not see that it makes
very mucli alteration. I presunie that the
matter will corne before the Minister of
Public Works.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Well, it
should.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: He would make
a recommendation to counicil, and counicil
would probab!y act on bis recommendation
anyhow.
Hon. Sir JA'MES LOUGHEED: There is
more or less conflict between the Department of Public IVorks and the Department
of Marine and Fisheries; so the amendment overcomes that difficulty. Then, a
recommendation may be received by the
Governor in Counicil from either depart-menit. By striking out those words lwe
leave it an open question which. department shall intervene.
Hion. Mr. BOSTOCK: I drew mny hionourable friend's attention to the wording
in the first hune cf new section 4, and I
understood he wouhd look into that matter.
The wording as it appeara now, in line 19,
is: "No work shail be. built or placed in."
But in hune 23 it reads: "Unhees such -work
is bult, placed and maintained,- etc. The
suggestion I made was th-at atter the word
" in," in line 19, the words "or maintained"
should be inserted. Then it would read:
"«No work shahl be buiht or placed in or
maintained."
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The word
"maintained - would flot apphy to the conditions recited in the first hine, because
this anticipates the securing of the approval of the Governor in Council lor a
work to be buiht. This section says:
No work shall be built or Placed In, upon,
over, under, through or across any navigable
water unlesa the site thereol lias been approved
by the Governor In Counel, nor unless such
work ia buit, placed and maintained in accordance with plana and regulationa approved or
made by the Governor In Council.

The-n later on provision is made for its
continuance, or its maintenance.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: But I understand
that there are certain works throug-hout the
country that are already built or phaced iu
navigable -waters.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I have
handed to the 'Chairman o~fthe Comrnittee

an arnendrnent, whvichl permits application
being made te the Governor in Council to
approve or sanction such works.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Supposing it i- net
desirable.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHE-ED: The,-n it
would be removed. The power in the present Act -would be exercisable as we.1 as
that which is mentioned in this Act for removing such works. When. zy honolirable
friend observes the application of the
amendment which I propose to sectIon 5
I think lie will see that it will meet the
situation.
Subsection 1 et newv section 4 was agreed
to.
On subsectien 2 ef new section 4--sniall
works excepte-d:
Hon. Mr. RICHARDSON: Do I understand that a man could net build a boatlieuse or anything else without the consent
ot the minister?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Ail lie lias
te do is te make application te the Minister
of Public Works. It seems to me only proper that application shouid be mnade te the
representative of the Government bef,,re a
d-evice or a construction is erected over a
navigable water.
Hon. Mr. RLOHARDSON: Ail *water is
more or less navigable. It niay be for a
raft or for sawlegs. That ouglit te be clearly
defined.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Under tbe
Navigable Waters Protection Act that is a

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I sliould like te ask
the leader of the Government why the

Hon Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is a

the same position as a Deputy Minister.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: What happens in
a branch like the Mint? I suppose the
Deputy Master et the Mint is in the same
position. 8hould net he be put in hiere?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Ne,

Hon. Mr. BQSTOCK: This section beýins
with the words, " There shall be a commissionl." 1 presume the intention is that. the
three commissioners m-ho are at present
acting will be continued on that commiseion?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Therefore those
commissioners will hold office for ten years

from the time of the passing of this Act?
H<rn. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. POWER: If I had any crif;cismn
to make on this section it would be that it
puts a commissioner out of office wh"n hie
attains the âge of sixty-five years. We have
a great many very active and energetic
officers in this country who are bezaveen
sixty-five and seventy, and muy idea is that
seventy would be a more appropriate age
than sixty-five.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That' is
the age already ifixed, and I think we had
better stay with it.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Is that the age
fixed under the pre sent Act?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No. I arn
informed there is no age fixed under the
present Act..
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Under the present
Act, then, the commissioner would retire
only at the end of his terni; ia that tie arrangement?

of the civil service where they a.re required.

Have they registered any objection Vo bein.overlooked?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They are
making a very heavy sacrifice in handing

they formerly exercised. It may be in the
public interest. That isa to be detenmined.
Hon. Mr. POPE: 1 would like to -ask

Increase of salary to any person transferred.

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: What is the abject
of striking that ont?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It leaves
a greater discretion ta the commission, so
that -if the circumstances warrant an increase of salary ta a persan transferred, it
gives the commission thie opportuniity of
sa reporting ta the Governar in Council.

Hon. Mr. POPE: May I ask the honourable leader o! the Government if the

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED- Subsecian 3 will now became subsection 2.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: What is the abject
af what will naw be subsection 2? It may7
occur. that it would be desirable ta transfer
Vo a certain position a man whô is aver the
age at which he might have been appointed
ta that particular position. I do noV quite
sec why that subsection should be there
at ahl.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUIGHEED: It might
lead ta abuses ta allaw men advanced in
yeans ta seek transffers af that kind.
Hoa. Mr. BOSTOQK: But this subsection
is unden the contrai of the commission in
the sanie way as the previaus subsectian,
which we- have -stnuck out. We have ta
trust the experience and judgment af the
commission as ta whethen it is advisable ta
approve of the transfer.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEÊD: It will
prevent influence and pressure from being
brought ta *bear upan the commission by
persans penhaps advanced in age and seeking a transfer.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOOK: Would noV the sanie
consideratian apply in the case ai the subsection which we have struck out?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No.
Hon. Mn. BOSTOCK: Persans transferred
might say: "This is harder work than we
have done before; therefore we are entitled
ta an increase in salary." I think there
would be danger of the sanie kind of
pressure- beîng braught ta bear on. thie

Hon, W. B. ROSS mnoved the third reading
of ihe Bill. He said: The only thing I
wish to say with regard to the report of the
committee is that in striking out sections
1, 2, 3, and part of 4, the comniittee felt

On the motion for concurrence in the
third report of the Joint Conmmittee on
Printing:
Hon. Mr. DENNIS: There are Iwo or
three points about the report which I w'ould
like to mention. The report forinally recoinmends the printing of a few returns. and
then it gives a long statement of documients
that are not to bie printed. The chief point
1 would like to mention is that the comnmittee is endeavouring to effect economnies
in the printing of bluebooks, as to the
number of pages and the number of copies;
also to effect a large economny amounting

ta $20,000 or $30,000 in the cost of paper.
Asthe paper is iikely ta be purchased at an
eariy date I desire ta have this report
adopted thir afternoon, if possible.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: I would like ta
ask the honourable gentleman who brings
in this report why it refers particulariy to
the Customs returns?
Hon. Mr. DENNIS: The report referred
ta is a monthly report isrued by the Customs
Department and is simply a duplication of
the. figures printed by the Department of
Trade and Commerce. A reBolution of the
Joint Committee on Printing was adopted.
eight or ten years ago, providing that 3,5W0

recommendation is to re6cind that resolutien compeiling the printing cf 3,5ff0 unnecererary copies.
Hon. Mr. POWER: This report, I suppose, will receive the cordial appraval af
almoet every member of this House. There
is juist one paint as te which I do nbot feel
quite clear. Under this report and under
previaus reporta of the com.mittee, there
wiil b. a very consideriabie saei-ng in
expenidàture for printing and distribution.
There is thie point ta be considered, though.
1 'Lhink that there is room for further
economy, and I shouid like, ta learn from
the Chairman of the Printing Càomittee
whether tihe committee have moade, any
proposai which will cover the case tihat I
amn about ta mention. Honourabie gentleMen will have notioed. that siips are
distributed ta the members of the House,
infrming them that such-and-such a bluebook has been printed. If we did aur duty
carefuily and consciientiousiy we shouid
exa.mine these slips and make the proper
return ta the distribution office, but, as a
matter o! fact, senators do not do that. I
know I have mnot donc it myseif, and I have
seeri sorne of my honourable coileagues
si.mply drap these slips into the. wastebasket.
Han. Mr. DANDURAND: That is ai that
is neeessary if a meanher does not want the
bluebook.
Hon. Mr. POWERl: I order ta meet the

that are to be puhlished during the oomdng
year, and that each member a.nd everyaneautside of Parliament who is entitled to
receive copies of the bluebooks, should mark
on this table the reports with whîch he
wishes t'a be furnished. As a inatter of
fact, I think ithat the. most«cof the in.eabers
of this Hause wo'uld not wish ta. be

In that way the Department ci Publie

rave not oniy the cost uf distribution bnt
the cost of printing and of paper, a very
important item. I trust that the honourable the. chairman of -the committee will
be able ta in!form us that that reform is
also ta be ado.pted.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: As I understand it,
the reform suggested by the honourable
gentleman from Halitax (Hon. Mr. Power)
ir being .aarried aut at the present time.
Borne tew years ago the plan was adopted
of nlot distributing the blue books until
they were asked for. We have to wait until
ail the reports are presented ta Parliament.
I suppose same are not do'wn yet. Consequently the departmenL notifies the members as soon .as a repart jr presented anid
ready for printing. Then a card is sent
out, and, il a report ils wanted the card ir
marked a'id sent back.
Hon. Mr. SMIfTH: Do I understand that
this card is issued before the books are
really printed?
Hon. Mr. WATSON: I understand se.
Hon. Mr. B-OYER: No.
Hon. Mr. POWER: The scheme that 1
propose wouid rave the cost of printing and
paper. The'plan which has been ini operation raves the oost o! distribution., but the
cost of prin'ting and paper is considerably
more than the cost of distribution.
Hon. Mr. WATSON. 1 take it for granted
that ail reports are printed to a greater or
less extent.
Hon. Mr. POWER: Not -necessarily.
Hion. Mr. WATSON: 1 will 'refer ta the
Chairman -of the Printing Committee.
Hon. Mr. DENNIS: Ail departmnental

SENATE
Han. Mr. BEIQUE: I think the point
taken by the honourable senior member
for Halifax is well advised. As it is, ithese
slips are issued alter a given number ai
reports have been printed.
Han.. Mr. WATSON: No.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Yes. The card is
an advice that yau can apply and get sachand-such a repart. I take it that tihe cards
are issued as fast as the reports are printed
and ready for distribution. What is e'uggested by the honourable senior inember
for Halifax is that a list should be issued
and distributed before thIe printing is done,
and that members ai Parlianient and other
persans who are entitled ta receive the
Parliamentary blue books be requested ta
declare what their requirements are. As
was properly stated, that wîll enable the
Government ta save considerable in the
printing of t.hese reports. Il only one
hundred copies of a certain repart are
app]ied for, what is the use ai printing
possib.ly a thousand or twa thousand copies?
Hon. Mr. DÂNDURAIND - I have one af
the ècards here. I de not know whether it
is the same card that is distributed in
every instance. This card saye:
Parllamentary Distribution Office,
flouse of Conunans.
Dear Sir:
1 beg ta tnform you that the following report
han been recelved. and that copies are ,now
avalable for distribution.
Yours respectfully,
R. B. Davidson.
That is Trade and Commerce, part I.
l3efore we are asked whether we need that
report, it ie already printed. If we fail ta
answer, the only saving is in the distribution, noV in the printing. The printing
is useless.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE: We ail agree
that the cast af printing must be reduced,
but there is a -question af fact ta -be ffettled.
I understand that as a matter ai law the
departments are obliged ta have one copy
ai every repart printed and brought up ta
cLhe Flouse within fifteen days alter the
opening. Sa, according ta law, the reports
must be printed. The question of fact is
whether this notice is sent ta every member
alter the report is on the press in order
that as many copies may be printed, because if we follow the suggestion ai the
senior meinher for Halifax many weeks
before the House is called we shall receive
a list af tihe reports and shall be asked
which we require; and, in arder ta be on
the safe side we will ask-for reports that
H-on.. Mr. DEUN7-NIS.

we rea.lly do not require, and in that way
'more copies wi 1 ' be printed than are necessary. If this card is sent out only alter
the report is on the press ready ta be
printed, after it has been composed, is it
not the better system, because we will just
askl for those reports that we want?
'Hon. Mr. WATSON: I have just inquired
from the distribution office, and they have
informed me that five hiun dred copiea of
reports are .printed for the Senate and the
House of Coimmons. There used ta be eight
or nine hundùred, but bý# means af isainzlg
these cards that ninmber has been raduced.
-Hon. Mr. DENNMS: And they may be
able ta cnt it down a great deal more.ý 1
appreciate the excellent suggestion, made
by the senior meinher from -Halifax (Hon.
~Mr. Powex), and will ta-ke the earliest possible opportunity to subm.it it to -the comrnittee, so that we may be aibIe stili further
ta economise in the number of copies being
printed.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: The report which
we have before us does not interfere with
that in the slightest degree. Ail it asks is
that a different class o~f paper should be
:wyith the printing
by the Cuatams Departm.ent and aiso ;by
the Depa:rtment of Trade and Commerce.
B~y adopting. this report, you efee-t a saving
af $30,000. If we follow the line indicated
byy the senior member for Halifax we go
further, and wil1 do more next (year; but
I think *the report before us should be
adopted, in order that we may show our
approval of tihe work done by the ohairmnan and rthe mernbers of the committee,
many of çwhom are engag-ed in the nerwspaper business. They are giving a great
deal of tixne and attention ta this matter,
and no one can'abje-ct ta the resuIt.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Nobody o.bjects.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: Nobody abjets, but
at the same time, whiae we keep talking,
we cannot get the report through.
Hon. Mr. OLORAN: The repart do-es nat
go f ar enougli. If -1 were the ehairman of
th-at oom.mit'tee, 1 would sugges.t that tihe
cheape6t paper possible should be used,
wit-h the exception of about hall -a-dozen

of Common6, or trades people throughout the country indicate the reports that
they want when they do not know what is

They djo flot know wýhether they will be of

cannot indicate your choice of a thing without knowing what it is. The proposition
fails to the ground by itself. The card
systemn as explained by the honourahie
member frorn Portage la Prairie <Hon. Mr.
Watson.) anxd the lionourable igentleman
from Quebec (Hon. Mr. Choquette) is ail
right. A card is sent out as-king if you
want a certain report. Il you want that
report-not oniy one copy, for you may
want ten, or a dozen, or a huridred, if it is
of interest to your constituents--you ask for
it. What suits one person does flot suit
another. The card system is practically the
best.
Hoil. -Mr. GIRROIR: It is pretty bard
for any one to know in advance of the
printing of a report whetber he wants it
or not. If, on the other hand, a person
has Vo rend ail the reports over in order to
know what hie wants, hie has a pretty ibig
contract alhead of him. 1 think the lionourable senior member for Halifax is perfect]y
right in his proposition, and for eeveral
reasons. First, because it gives the Coinmittee on Printing, or those who are managing that end of the businese, 'an, opportunitv to know sorne tirne in advance what
numbýer of reports are likely to bie needed.
That is as far as we can go. WVe
cannot
advise the exact number, but we can give
sorne indication, and a few extra copies
may have Io be prin-ted in order to satisfy
the possible demand. We get these cards
from time to timne, and if we want the report in question we sign the card, send it
in and get the report; if not, -we throw the
card in the waste basket. If the session 16
over, perhaps sorne -question may corne up,
and we may want one of these reports. We
know in the main what reports are printed,
but there are a number printed on different
subjects by different departinents t.hat we
do flot often know very much about. If

613

we had a ist, as suggested by the senior

miember for Halifax, we couid alivays have
that at hand, and if any subjeet carne up
we could refer to the list. and send fer the
report required. If there 'were any copies
of the report ieft ive could get it, if not,
w-wouid have to go Vo the pariiarnentarv
iibrary. For the reasons I have given,I
tbink that is the better proposition.
The report w-as corcurred in.
CIVIL SERVICE BILL.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE--THIRD
READING.

The Senate again went into G4omrnittee
on Bill 53, an Act respecting the Civil
Service of Canada.-Hon. Sir James 'Lougheed. Hon.. '-%r. Crosby -in -the Chair.
On section 39--computation of number of

probable vacancies:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: There is
no exceptionai change in clause 39 except
in subsection 2. In paragraphis a a.nd t1
provision will be found giving returned
soidiers the precedence ýand excepting them
frorn the ordinary age lirnit and the
physical xequirements. The other provisions
are sirnilar to those 110w in force.
Subseetion 7 provides that when a succesaful codripetitor
receives
ternporary
empioym-ent, the tiffue of the temporary
employment is to be coun-ted in respect of
any annuai increase. With these exceptions,
this clause iis practicaliy the sanie as in the

old Act.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOC.K: The Bill whicbi I
have before me says at the end of subsection 2: -1906. ézection, 29. arnended." Section 29 of the Revi-ed Statutes of 11906 reads
as follows:
Immredlately alter each exarnination a list Of
persons w-ho are found qualified shall be miade
out and publjshed ini the Canada Gazette.
There ia a considerable dîfference betw-eeii
that section and subsection 2.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
As I w;as not
here this rnorning., wiil thbe honourabie
gentleman tell me if the Civil Service comnmission has any power as to the tnanningof the departments? This clause says that
they wiil settle upon the, number of
eompetitors Vo be sciuected, having regard

to the requirements of t-be several departments. Have tbey any control as to the
requirements of thbe departments?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUtGHEED: It is
anticipated that eacb departrnent ivili not

SENATE
ments are. 1 think eachi departmient will
know better than any other wh'at its needs
are or may be. That is te say, the initiative
%viliflot be taken hi' the emrniuissiori.
Hon. Mr. DANDURANm: I put the question because there is an impression abroad
throughout the land, and even here in
Ottawa, tbat bas been of long standing, that
ail the departments are over-manned. Has.
the commission any control. over that
question?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes, As
I 'pointed out this merning, we 'have already
made provision in the Bill for the Commission at any time to investigate conditions
in a ,depairtnierrt. Section 9ý, subsection
4, gi ves ample powe's to the commission te
carry out such changes as they suggest.

gather, from readýing the Debates in another
place, that there were a number o.f gentle~men who thought that ne qualification
whatever should be required from persons
who had. been on active service. 1 am
glad to see that it means, that, if they
have the necessary qualifications and pass
the examinations, they -should thoen have
'the preference. I think that is as far as
we should go; other things being equal, thev
should get that preference.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: In subsection 6 of
section, M 1I notice the phrase, "position
in the service." Does that mean the civil
service?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: W\ould it not bie
better te caîl it "civil service"?
Hon. Sir JAMES LIOUGHEED: We are
only dealing wîth one service.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHE'ED: From

Section 40 was-agreed to.
On section 41-appointees mnust b>e British
subjects unless special exemption:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I arn in doubt
as te the wisdom. of specifying residence in
Canada for only one year as entitling one
te a preference in sntering the civil service.
Ws will have over 500,000 soldiers-returning
from. the other side, a.nd they will be entitle-d tô precedenice a! ter passing examinatiens. We ail admit that they will not be
absorbed into the civil service; yet even if
only one-fifth of the soldiers applied for
positions, we would'be opening the door to
an invaision of .British eo-ldders who in the
-second or third year may be competing -wil2h
our owu, thougli tthey were not in our
forces or .euisted by us. - This simply
meaus ihat we cou]d vwe11 afford to raise tihe
period of residence- in Canada to 4hree years
feur people who were net in the Canadian
Expedi!tionary Force.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: The honourable
gentleman will ses that the section has a
sort oi door in it, ini the words, "no pereon
shal. without the au-thority of -the Governor
in Çoxn.cil," be admitted to examination.
Any person coming from the other aide
could only take the civil service examination by order oif the Governor in Council.
Hon. Mr. DANDUR.AND: But you may
have 500,000 of our own soldiers re'turning,
and within the following thrse or four
ysars 100,000 British soldiers coming from
the British Iss, sorne of themn with a
view to entering the civil service through
the pr-eference given to soldiers; and thsy
would be in competition with our own
to me that
Canadian soldiers. It sees
one year is not a sufficient preferenos ta
give to our own soldiers ta enter the civil
service b-efore people f rom abroad come in
-and coenpete with thein.
It seerns to me the
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:
argument o! the honaurable senator from
De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) is a
very strong one. There should be at least
three yearS ree.idenle reqUired in'steOad If
one. I would be very glad to support that.
As the honourable gentleman'has pointed
out, we will have a very large number of

returned soldiers of our own, grown in our
own country, who ought to have 'the pre-.
f ergnce, and I think that a man should
earn his living in this country for at least
three years before he becomes a pensioner
on the public, or receives recognition in
that way.
Hon. M. DANDURA±ND- If my suggestion meets with response, I will move to
replace the words «"one year" by t.he words
"three years." Th-at will give our soldiers
a chance to have their own caies deait with
before new corners are entitled to'enter the
service.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We will
aocept that.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I would like to ask
whether a woman is a - person 't in this
Act. Subsection 1 of section 41 says: " No
persorn shall . . . unless. he is a naturalbayrn or naturalized British subject.Hon. W. B. ROSS: "He" ineans "as."
also "eohe"?
Hou. tMr. DANI~EL: 'e"is
Ho n. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Well, he
may be. Under the Interpretation Act, «he"
includes femalea.
On aubsection 2 of section 41-age li-mits:
Hon. Mr. POWER: R strikes me that this
clause is based on a 'wrong principle. For
a great many years t.he age limita have
been flxed by statuts, and every ons knows
'what they are. This subsection proposes to
substituts for the Act of Parliament a regulation of the commission approved .by the
Governor in Council. I think that is a mistake. We should fix by statute the age
limits, and leave -the commission power to
make appointments 'within those limits. I
think this subsection opens, the door for
a good, deal of abuse and irregular practîce. If the commission changes the age
limits, as they may, * a one 'will know
whsther he is eligible or not. I think it
better to fix the age limits by statute, as in
the past.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Has my honourable friend any remarks te make in regard
to the ague lirnits?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It is not
desirable te have a provision of that kind
arbitrarily fixed hy statuts. Thers may be
conditions which would render At very desirable te fix the age limits by Order in
Council. Furthermore, to bring this Bill,
which deala particularly with the Outaide
Service, into harmony with the law relating
te the Inside Service, it is not desira:ble to

616

SENATE

re-enact the arbitrary clauses that at 'piesent exist in the Civil ServiceAd. I think
this is a matter that can be safely left with
the Governor in Council.
Section 41, as amended in subsection 1,
was agreed ta.
On section 42-claEsification, Inside Service:
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I would like ta ask
the minister if he could give us a definition
of the difference between -the Inside Service
and.the Outside Service. What does the
Inside Service rea'lly mean? I thought the
Inside Service meant the service here in
Ottawa, but L understand from one of my
colleagues that there are mien- in MontTeal
and other places who are in the Inside
Serv'ice.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: And there are
many in Ottawa who are in the Outside
Service.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If my
honourable friend will look at section 2,
paragraph d, lie will find there probably as
clear a definition as I could give by any
expression of mine. That is the definition
clause. Furthermore, -the part we are now
considering, part IV, deals exclusively with
the Inside Service.
Section 42 was agreed ta.
On section 43--salaries:
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: I understand that
some of the present de'puty heads are
receiving $6,000 a year. Does this mean
that their salaries will be reduced to $5,000?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: No; this
does not affect them at ail.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: But it applies to
future appointments?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED:- Yes;
they will be appointed on that basis.
Hon. Mr. PRINGLE: I see that in
subsection 2 of section 42 technical officers
are graded in grades A and B, and by
section 43 their salaries range from. $2,90
to $3,400. Grade B, as described in-section
42, ineludes the principal teclinical officers,
whereas in subsection 2 of section 43 it is
provided:
The salaries of technloaL1 officers of the
hlghest clas shall be such as Pariament rnay
provide.
There seemas ta be a confict there. In
one section the salary is fixed by statute,
and in another it is stated that they shall
have such salaTy as Parliament mnay
provide.
Hon. Sir JAIMES LOUG3ZEEY

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Subsection 2 of section 43 deals with a different
class of technical officers, those of the
highest c]ass.
Hon. Mr. PRINGLE: The highest class
is hîgher than the principal class?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes,
and their salaries are lef t ta be provided by
Parliament.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: I would like ta
inquire if the grading under subsection 3
conforms with the present grading in the
Civil Service?
Hon. Sir JAIMES IOUGHEED:
som.ewhat analogous ta, it.

It

is

Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK:- There is -a change.
The subdivisions seem to lie divided again.
The salaries in the old subdivision A of
the first division ranged from $2,800 ta,
$4,000. But iii this case the salaries ini
grade A run froin $3,5(» to $4,000, and in
grade B they run from $2,900 to, $3,400.
The new Act, a.pparently provides for a rearrangment of the grades.
Hon. Sur JAMES LOUGHEED:
'] here
are new grades.. They are perhaps more
slc>wly aacending than ini the existing law.
6ection 43 was agreed ta.
On section 44-annia

Hon. 6ir JAMES LOUGHEED: I mnove«
the following amendment ta that section :
£uch increase shall be made unless the deputy head makes a report tin writing, whtch is
concurred in by the Commission, that such
officer, cierk or employee ls not deserving of
such Increase.

That is ta say, the increase ir, autamatie
unless there is a report ta the contrary by
the deputy ininister.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Would it not be
better ta reverse tliat, providing that thie
incrxease sihail be g.iven on the report of
thie deputy head and ahall not take effect
iinlees the report of the deputy head is

-Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
open ta the objetion that it places every
employee in the handa of the deputy
minigter.

anyway.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOU'GHEED: We are
doing that ta a certain extent, but ie ft

MAY 21,.1918
Hon,. Mr. FOWLER: The honourable
gentleman speaks of the. pawer given ta
the -deputy. Yoii are giving hini -abse1ute
po'wer; you are striking at the principle
ai reslponsible gavernment in -thi8.
Han. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But ta
woxk this out ta its logical end we have
to vest authority in some officiai, and) logi0ally lt ehould be -the deputy head of -the
diepartment; but where it is unnecessary
ta, veat authority in hîlm we had better not
do so. That is ta say, il we can arrange
that these salaries shaJI be increased autoinatically, by reason of length of aervice
of an officer in a department, there la no
gaod reason why we should not do ao.
There la the oniy distinction.
. Hon. Mr. FOWLER: Peranally I do not
think tbsit a man should receive an increase in salary merely on aocoun.t of
length of aervice. He «hould not receive
an inecrease uniless his work justifies it. I
thaught the intent o! tihe new Bill wua ta
reward imenit and take asway the autamatic
principle; but you are not doing that at
ail.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND. I oId ask my
(Hon. Sir James
friend
honouraible
Lougheed) how he interpreta section 44 end
iu whom the authority for its enforcement
is v'ested:
There may be given ta every officer, clerk. or
Other emPloyee In the firet division,, an amnîai
Increase of one hiundred dollars, and In the
other divisions an annual increase of fifty
dollars. until the maxfnu!m of the grade la,
reached.
There inay be given; by whom-upon
whose recammendation?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUfGHEED: By the
(Jrown-by the Government. Then we make
the provision more expressive by the
emendment which I have juat handed in.
But by that
Hon. Mr. DkNDURAND:
yau increase -the confusion in =y imid.
The deputy mnister inay object, which.
shows that somebody other than hixnself
bas acted, ihough it la frain him -that the
reeommendation éhould, emanate. He has
the staff under bis authority, yet action is
apparently taken, not by him, acordmng ta
the amendaetHon. Sir JAMES LOTJGHEED: No; by
the statute.
Hon. Mr. DAN.DURÀND: Uniesa he
objecta te a certain name in the list, 'the
list amust be prepared with the reomniendatian ta council, and the practice is for the

6

Iminister himseif ta bring in, the list of increases -for the staff of his depart.ment. The
increas are autom'atic.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOÙGHEED: The increases are made au.tomatioally year alter
year, and there is only one source of payment, that is, -the Crown.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If the increases
are automnatie, 1 cannot understand this
wording: " There may be given ta every
persan."1
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But
..may," under the Inteoepretation Ad,.
means "shall." Then, unddr the amendment it is msde really imperative, because
it reads: ."Such increase shail be made unless the deputy h.ead-"
Hon. Mr. WATSON: I would pref er -te
see adopted. the system .suggested by the
hanourable gentleman irom Sussex (Hon.
Mr.. Fowler). I think it would be inuch
better that the increases should be given
on the recommendaition of the deputy head.
Hon. Mr. OCHOQUETTE: The amendment eays 50.
Hon. .Mr. WATSON: The, i&mendinont'
provides the reverse, it sayaý that the increause hall be given unlesa the dePutY
head reporta that it should miot be givenHon. Mr.' CROQUETTE: Thsat aimounts,
ta the sme thing.
Hou. Mr. WATSON- We have adepted
in this House the syatem of granting the
annual increases ta our staff on the recom-.
mendation of the Clerk. who occupies the
position of a deputy head. Now, it is xnuch
easier lor the Clerik ta drap off any persan
ta the annual increase
- who is not entitled
than it would be ta specify him and have
his increase -withheld. R think it would
certainly be in the best interests ai the
service ta have the deputy head recammend
the increasea. A civil servant ahould not
'be entitled ta an increase unless he is
rendering good service for the maney, pal d
hini, and the extra amount provided would
be an incentive for hini ta work up ta At.
It would. be much better ta grant incress
on the recommendation of the deputy head.
Hon. Mx. CHIOQU=TE: I 'woul suggest
that inatead of ail that red tape, requiring
the recommendatian ta go ta the deputy
minister and then ta the Commissian, At
would be better, ta give the minister a
chance. I would not at ail abject ta providing that the minister may under ipecial

serving- employee. If the min'ister is willing- ing on the Part of the deputy minister.
to grant such an - increase tô a deserving
civil servant, why should it be necessary
for the recommendation to go to the deputy
minister, then from hini to the commission,
and from the commission back, to the miniGter? Why not provide that t1he minîïster,
if he thinks proiper, may atonce give the
increase? 1 would be willing to vote for
such a provision.
Hon. Mr. GIRR-OIIR: TI think that the
complaint ail along bas ibeen that the
deputy ministers in the different departmeaits pick and-choose amongst the members of the staff; a man is advanced because
the deputy minister likes him.- The civil
servant now bas the protection of this
clause, and he cannot b)e refused his regular
increase unless the.deputy minister certifies
that -he às not entitled te it. There, is in
addition the further protection that the
deputy minister, in certifying that a particulai clerk should not receivc the increase,
must have behind him the assent of the Civil
Service iCommission.. So, ini order te prevent
a civil servant fromn obtaining his regular
annual increase, it is neoessary to have
not only the assent of the deputy, minîster,
but also the assent of the Civil Service Commission. .I think that a man should get
bis increase regularly according to the plani
of this Bill, unless there is some speciai
reason to the contrary; and 1 even go so
f ar as to say that when a man is depriveà
,of his increase the reason for depriving hîmi
should be stated. Then, an employee who
bas a grievance and ha-s a case wouldkhnow
why be bas not been given bis increase.
You hear civil servants say to-day, and tbey
bave been saying for years past:, "So-andso bas been promoted; be bas got his increase; I have not got mine; wby bave 1
flot got it"
He cannot find out; nobody
will tell bim. That has been current taflk
among civil servants for years, at least
since'I bave corne to Ottawa. Such complaints will alI be done away with, and
every civil servant will -,et bis regular
increase unless there is some special
reason to the contrary. I do not want to
move an amendment or delay the Bill
at this stage, but I will go as far as to say
that 1 wôiuld be in favour of requiring that,
wben the deputy n>inister or the Civil
Service Commission declares that a man
is not entitled to the regular increase, the
reason should be stated.'
Hon. Mr. POWER: 1 think that e man
should have the rigbt to appeal in case it
is -saitl that he i.s not. en.titled to an increase, because it may be a matter of feel.
Hon Mr. CHOQU=ETE.

The civil servant -ought certainiy to bave
therigbt to be-heard. in an appeal eitber
to the minîster or to the commission.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: He has
an appeal Vo the commission.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: No; it is not an
appeal that is provided for in the Bill, because the civil servant is not supposed Vo
be heard hefore the commission. He ougbt
to be beard before the commission; but
the procedure will be -autiomatic: the deputy
minister will make his report against t.his
man, and the commission will automatically
take the matter up. This mari has a riglit
we be allowed to appeal t-Q the commission
or Vo the minister, and the matter would
then become a case to be argued out, on
the e'vidence beard.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR: If you insert a
clause providing th-at the civil servant shaîl
have an appeal to the minister, you are
going back Vo wbere you 'were befor e.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER: That would 'net be
a bad thing-, I think.
Hon. Mr. GIRROiR: Then a civil servant will corne to a meinher and say: "I1
did net get my increase this year; ,I amn
entitled to it; I want you Vo interest yourself. in rny position." And there would be
members -ind others interested going to the
mînýisters, and -you would have ail sorts
of trouble; -but, as the clause stands, I cannot, conceive that a - deputy would. recommend that a man sbould. not get. bis increase, and that at the same time he would
be able te exercise sufficient influence Vo get
the Civil Service Commission Vo back bim
up in that recommendation, unless there
were good reasons why tbe civil servant
concerned should not get bis increase.
There are two independent authorities, the
deputy minister and the Civil ServiceCommission. They hold office during pleasurecannot be removed; and these -two authorities are noV going to combine against the
poor civil -servant. Wbile one of them, perhaps the deputy minister, might, have some
grievance, 1 cannot conceive that the Civil
Service ICommission, -outside ef the diepartment altogether, and not in touch 'with
the employees, would agree witbout good
reason with the recommendation against
an increase.
Hon. *Mr. FOWLER: IV would be very
natural for the commission to take the
word cf tbe deputy minîster.
Hon. Sir JAMElS LOUGHEED: Perhaps
this amendment would meet with the view
of my bonourable friend:

MAY 21. 1918
Such iricrease shall be made unless the deputy head makes a report in writing, which
la concurred In by the Commission, that such
officer, clerk, or employeel i fot deserving of
such Increase; and such officer, cierk or arnpioyee shall be entitied to be heard before the
Commission concurs In such report.

Hon. Mr. FOWLER: That is satisfactory.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know
to what extent you are weakening the
authority of the head of the department or
the deputy minister. There must be some
discipline and order in the department.
Hon. Mr. GIRROIR- « I understand that

Service Commission?
.Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Yes;
that is to say, if he desires to be heard
before the Commission, he shall have the
opportu.nity of being heard.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: In view of the
position we have given the deputy ministers
ini athl oui civil service legisiation, 1 think
we are making a mistake ini allowing the
employee to go past the deputy minister.
If there is to, be order, there must be a
head of the department, and the head of
the department is the deputy minister. If
the deputy minister does not 'do, his -duty
propeîly, the Government ought to see that
ha is removed. If persons employing labour
placed themnselves in such a position that
when the foreman wanted to dismiss a man
he could not do it, R would like to know
what control ha would have.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUJGHEED: The commission will not overlook the position oc- cupied by a deputy in such a case.
Hon. MS. 'POWER: The point made by
the honourable gentleman from. De Lorimier
<HI-on. Mr. Dandurand) is that the alhcowing
of an appeal from the deputy head to the
commission has a iendency toý diminish.
the authority of the deputy head, and to
deprive him of that>respect 'and deference
that he should have from bis subordinates.
1 do not think that the clause 'before us
makes any serious change in the exiating
law; but 1 would cail the attention of the
hocnoureble leader of the H1ouse to the provision in subsection 4 of section 37 of the
Civil Service Act of 1908, which it is true
applies only to certain spec.ial increases,
but which I think ought tc apply to ail
increases. It maya
The said increase shall oniy ba authorised by
the Governor in Council upon. the recommendation of the head of the department based on the

,I think these increases should be Iimited
to persona 'who are recommended by the
deputy head.
Houi. Mr. BEAU-BIEN: I venture ta say
that it would be a great mistake to depart
from the principle enunciated in the Bill.
Sorne of my honourable friends opposite

dealt with by tite deputy. Thousands of

The effect of this bas been that a number

1. What Is the saiary of the Auditor General?
2.. Are Harold John Fraser and Ethel- Maud
Fraser entployed In any department of the
public service? If sa, in what department, when
were they respect!vely first employed, and what
are their sala-ries?
. . Are William A. Fraser and Robert J.

If sa, iln what department or departments, and
what are their salaries respectively?
4. Are the said Harold John Fraser, Ethel
Maud Fraser, William AL Fraser and Robert J.
Fraser related ta the AudItor General? If Sa,
what is the relationship?

The answer 'was that those persans were
employed in the public service; and an8wer number 4 -states: "«Yes, sons and
daughter respectively." That is, that those
who were maies wer-e sons af the Auditor
General, aud the other, the. female,' was

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
often hetard of the admirable service of
England, and the point -raieed by my
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Power) causes
mie to wonder whether the term -Civil

of 'the British Government?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOIJGHFEED: I arn told
t.hat in the United States the term "Civil

a siaxilar clause. But I zould net say as to
Great Britain.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It is intended to

Hon. Sir JAMES WOUGHEED: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL- I understand that
this Act takes in the whole Outside Service
as well es the Inside Service?
Hon. Sir JAMES dLOUGHEED: Yes.
*Hon. Mr. DlANIEL: And ithat every
employee of either the Inside or the Outside
Service, whether tha.t employee is at the top
or the bottom of the list, rnusit be appointed
by the CiviU Service Commission. That is
correct, I believe?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Well,
practically with the sanction of the Civil
Service Comimission. There are such cases
as were rnentioned the other day, where it
may be desîrable -to appoint employees
without any delay, and the head of the
particular brainch concerned will employ
them and in due course report the inatter
to ithe Civil Service Commission. Theremay not be an examin-ation.
Hon. Mr. FOWLER:- If a viacancy occurs
in a country post office, what about that?

SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAIMES LOUGHEFD moved the
.second reading of Bill 87, an Act supplementary to Chapter Twenty-four of the
Statutes of .1017, respecting the Canadian
Northern Railway Systemn.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the
purpose of this Bi i ls to give a.uthority to
the Glovern.ment, in connection vith the
Canadian Northern Rail-way system, to
guarantee the renewal or postponement of
such payments as are falling due at a comparatively earlyý date. Thierle are certain
short-term îloans outstanding, the total of
'whirh represents $67,360,607. lu vie w of
the fact that t.he Goivernment of Canada

logically follows that such loane as are

those inaturing at an early date, must be

Ail these loan4 are falling- due at an eiirly
diav therefore it is. necessary te have the
authority provided for in the Bill.
Hors. Mr. DANDURAND: Are ail those
loans gýuaraniteed?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They are
secureci by coliateral. 0f *coursze, if the
Governmient of Canada should have te pay
off those loans, the collateral wvill revert to
the Goveriument.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: Honourable gentlemen, we have discussed this question
of the liabilities aesurned by the Government on the Canadian Northern transaction on severa] other occasions. This Bill
ie apparently a Bill to supplement the
legisiation that we enacted hast session at
the request of the Government. Since that
timie the Governrnient lias appointed a. board
et arbitrators for the purpose of erriving et
a decision as to whether or not there is
any value in the stock of this company.
It s.eems a rather curious position for the
Goverrument t.o have essumed, to be arbitreting the question whether there is any
value in the stock of a cornpany and at
the sane time asking that provision be
mede to meet the indebtedness of the cernpany. Honourable gentlemen will remember that in tise session of 1914, when it 'wes
necessary for the company te corne to Parliement and ask for assistance in order te
carry thern ever the difficulties in *which
they were placed, seme et the stock was
transferred te the Government, and one of
the conditions of the t.ransfer was that the
company shouid be al-lowed to issue several ihilioii&-I forget :the exact arnountmore of z1oek. for whiclh there -wae no paymient made. Il wasz sirnpy a transaction in
writing- te enabie the Ceompany te increase
their capital frorn, I thinkz, $77,O00,000 to
$100,000,000. The arbitretion that hias heen
proceeding in Toronto for several menthe
past is for the purpose o! deciding whether
there is anv value in that stock or net.
part of it heing, as I have said, sirnply a
matter ef arrangement, and having certain]y
ne value. The purpose of this Biblisj te
enable the Government te arrange for t.he
financial liabilities ef the company. I
think any honeurable gentleman wvi1h see
that there Cati be ne value in the stock et a
ccmpany that has got into the position ef
being absoiutely dependent on the Gevernrnent te Cerne t-o their rescue and provide the moriey necessary te take up the
securities as 'they faîl due, whether they
were actually guarenteed by the Government at the start or net. I do net want
2-O

C
-

te take up the tirne of the House in discussing this question at any length., because it bas been discussed several tirnes
before, and anything that I night say at
the present lime would no douht hnve no
effect whatever on thie proposed legisiation.
Hon. Mr. BELCO1JRT: Will miv honourable friend (Hon. Sir Jamiesz Lougheed)
1ev on the Table a list of the securities
whiich. are affected by this legislation, giving the amount in each case, and also the
nature ef the present guerantee, se that
we may have some idea whether we are
giving the best guarantee that this countTy
Cen give, that is, ite ewn, guarantee, for a
guarantee rnay be et bittie Or ne, value
whetever. What 1 mean is this. If creditors
of the cempany have guarantees that are et
ne value and are geing te get in exchange
guarantees that are et value, we ought te
know what they are. Befere this Bill je
considered in 'Committee, I think that
information ought te be laid upen the Table
by the leader et the Governrnent.
With regard te the Bill itselt, I went te
add xny words et condemnation to those
uttered by rny honoureble leader. I entertain the strengeet possible view againet this
whole transaction. To niy mind nothing
but the fact that the country is absorbed
in the great question ef the war and the
preeoccupation and t he daily worries of the
war could have made it possible fer any
perty in this country te submit and secure
the passage of such legielation as was
pessed lest year, and -%iceh we are now
implenenting. My ve.abulary is totelly
inadequete te supply nie with words to
express my feelings in regard te this legislation. I wish again te enter in the st.rongeet way possible my protest again6t it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I a.sked the
leader et the -Government if these short
notes which are te be taken up or renewýed
or repleced by Gevernment securities are
secured notes. My honourable friend saîd
that there might be-cellaterals given agemnst
those notes. I went to repeat the point
that I made lest session, that people who
have advanced money without security te
the Canadien Northern et 75 per cent et
the face value o! the notes should be verv
happy indeed te receive the monev advanced
plus intereet, and I think the Governrnent
ohould pause hefore hiandirig over its ewn
security in exch ange for wlîich the railway
only received froin 60 10 S0 per cent o! the
face value.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: .My honourable
friend hec net stated «vhether he wouhd
iay the information 1 asked for on the Table.

SENATE
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If I can
get a list of the securities I shall be very
glad to place it on the Table. I understand
that collateral securities have been placed
in the hands of those m-ho negotiated the
boans, or who hold the boans against the
company. Furtheraîore, erîtire]y apart fromn
that consideration, if the Governnîent of
Canada is taking over the road it necessarily follows that it will have to meet the
obligations. *There is a further consideration. The g-uarantees that have been given
by this Government. extending back for the
last ten or twelve vears, have to be met by
the Government of Canada, and no other
alternative has presented itself to the
Government than to take over the road. If
the road defaulted, as it undoubtedly has
done, and would do in the future, the
Government of Canada from time to tirne
wouid have to make good those guarantees
which were sanctioned bv Parliament, and
given by the Governinent. It therefore
seems to me that the matter is resolved into
Hobson's choice. The Government has no
other alternative than to wipe eut the
original obligation which it assumned bv
way of guarantee. 0f course, no good
purpose will be served by weeping ever the
acts o! the late Government and the Gpvern.
ment that preceded it in connection with
this road. We have to face conditions as
they are. The question is. would it have
been wise for the Governmient of Canada te
have allowed this road to pass into a state
practically of wreckage, and to have mnet
the variolla guarantees which flot only this
Govern.n-ent but different provincial governments gave to the ro2d.

way lias been run for the last few vears, wiii
be a very valuable asset to this country.

INSPECTION AND SALE ACT AM'%ENDMrENT BILL (FRUIT, FRUIT MARKS
AND) POTATOESi.
SECOND READING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED rnoved the
second reading of Bill 108, an Act to ainend
the Inspection and Sale Act (fruit, fruit
marks, and potatoes).
He said: The purpose of this Bill is te
legisrate touching the Inspection and Sale
Act with regard to fruit, potatoes, etc. For
a number o! years the fruit-growers and
dealers of Canada have been urging" tliat
the Inspection and Sale Act, part IX,
be amended in order that the grading
o! fruits may be more clearly defined,
that the packages used for the shipment o!
such fruit may be standardized, and also
that the inspection of fruit may be of
greater value te ail concerned. Last
February it was decided to ask the various
provincial fruit-growers associations te
corne to Ottawa for the purpose of discussing this question with the officers o! the
Fruit Bran-eh. A t.wo-day'-s convention was
held, and the delegates unanimously approved of ail the amendments which we
are now asking this Charnher to adopt.
These amendments have the backing o! the
fruit interests of the country, and the legislation la pra.ctically of their own preparation. they having adopted resolutions approving it. I have no doubt the House

much discussed in ariother place, and I wvas
very much surprised n'hen I found that it
had made its way as far as this Chamber.
The impression I had-it may have been a
wrong one-was that it was not gaing to. be

inteî-ested in saine of the clauses of. this

TIIE SENATE AND M-\ONEY BILLS.
DISCUSSION CONTINUED.

The Senate resuined front May 20 the
adjaurned debate on the niatiali for the
cansideratioxi of the second repart of the
Special Conînîiittee appointed ta consider
the question cf deternîining what are the
rights of the Senate in mnatters of financial
legisintion. iand whether, under the provisions of tbe British Northi America Act,
167. it is perinissible, and ta what extent,
or forbidden. for the Senate ta amend a
Bi11 cînhlodvýinc2 financial clauses.
Hon. PASCAL POIRIEIR: Honourable
gaentlemen. it lias been suggested that I
ighlt put iii a couple mare hours in the
discussion af titis question. I tvill spare
te lause tlîat. and, will siniply ask the

forbearance of my honourable colleagues
for a few minutes.
The report of my honourable frîend from
Middleton (Hon. W. B. 'Ross), after dealing
directly with the question, drifts into the
opinions expressed by the makers of Confederation. I will pass over most of thein,
but wili refer ta that of Sir John A. Macdonald, who said: "We resolved that the
constitution of the Upper House should be
in accordance w'ith the British sys-tern as
nearly ae circuistances would aiiow ,
whichi puts us as nearly as passible on an
equal footig wvth the House of Lords in
inatters oi appropriation and nloney Bis.
Sir John Macdonald made fia reference ta
the Senate heing entrusted particularly or
directly with the safeguarding of the interests of the provinces; he simply assumed
that this Hanse wouid be as far as possible
on a par with the House of Lards. Mr.
Brown also expressed an opinion as ta the
duties and the status of the Senate of
Canada, and here is what hie said:
The desire. was ta render the Upper House a
thoroughly Independent body--one that would
be in the best position ta canvass dispassionateiy the measures of tbis House, and stand Up
for the publie interests in opposition ta hasty
or partisan legisiation.

These views have been adopted. We are
here frein our several provinces for the
purpose, amang other of oppasing, hasty
and parUtsan. legislation; and the Alniighty
knows if we have not ourselves been as
partisan as members of the other Houdie.
Now, tliis d-isposes pretty well of the contention of thtis report, that having been
appointed specially ta protectte provinces,
we are entruszted

wit.h

te right to inter-

fere *with appropriations and maney Bis
referring ta the -provinces. 'Neither
the
constitution nor the opinion of the Fathers
of Confederation confirins this. We certainly have authority over those questions, but
in no inore special maniner titan we have
over ather general iegislatîon.
,Appended to the repart, of -my honour-

able friend froin Midd]eton a (te expression of two leading lawyers of Montreal,
M.Lafleur and Mr. Aimé Geoffrion. These
are ciever statements of clever men, and
are ta me also a brîel or plea. But we do
noV want ta be convinced of our authority;
what we want ta know is how we stVand as
against the pretentians of the other Hanse;
and, instead of having a pica ahl ini aur
favour, I would have preferred some criticisin of the position we apparently intend
to take. I will paýsE that, over aiso. Next
cones
te expression of IMr. John B.
Ewart, K.C., of Ottawa, wiih in my

SENATE

opinion is the best of ail. It expresses a
prudent view of the matter, and one flot
hostile te the Sonate. In one ef the paragraphs of lic, lottor lie saye:
in considering ail subJects et the class te
which the prescrnt belongs, regard has alwvays,
and very rightly, been pîaid lu 1itory and precedents,-

That is my contention.

Ho adds:

-and the relations betwveen our Senate and
Heuse et Commeas are, as I think, so firmnly
establiahed that ne change could be introduced
save by constitutional amendment. 1 do net
mean, necessarily, by amendruent ef the Britlsh North America Act.
Amendment of constitutional practice. agreed upan by bath
Houses. weuld suffice.

Accordin-g te my viow, that is the enly
practical way ef dealing with this question.
We may pass any nuinber ef resolutions,
but if thev are net according te the views
of the oth;er lieuse, or if we do -not agree
with the ethor House on some workable
views, all thoso are but vain efforts towards
a goal we cannot reach.
This rosolution ils in its posSibilities tantamount Io throwing dewn the gauntlet te
the other House. I see ne necessity for
that. neither do I see any good from it.
The lieuse of Lords tried it in answer te
a resolution passed by the lieuse of Coinnions in 1678 in order te set the lieuse of
Lords back. That resolution was as follows:
That ail aids and supplies and aids te His
Majesty in Parliament are the sole gîft ef the
Commons. and that ail Bis for the grsnting
ef any sucb aida and supplies ought te begin
with the Coxumens, and that it ils the undoubted

To this the lieuse ef Lords answered
fifteen vear- later. in 169.3). I)- the following
reselutiun:

gentleman from IMiddleton for the very
valuahie information they have put before
us, and the elaborate report they have
muade, we should let this matter !iýý dormant,
and flot corne to any conclusion. Otherwi6.e it will be a gauntiet thrown down Io
the other House. If. we adopt this report,
as we were on the eve of doin. the Speaker
of this House would be in duty bound to
stand by this resolution in matters of appropriation and money Bis. whichi would
bring us into trouble. Troubles eome of
their own volition; let us not go and invite
trouble for our House. Let us keep to the
mission, always an honourable one, îvhich
consista more especially, if I rnay repeat the
opinion given by Sir John A. Macdonald
and George Browvn, of thwarting hasty,
indisereet legielation in matt-ersz wh'ere minorities mig'ht be molested; in equipioising
matters; but, in so far as money questions
are concerned, lot us always remember that
it is the people w~ho pay the taxes and pass
rnonoy Bis, and that our peoplo, who are
the heirs of the English peasants of two
centuries ago. are as solic.itous and as
jealous of their rights as their and our
ancestors were.

tishing the unrevîsed English edition, of
which 2,000 copies are distributed daily. I
venture to aay that, outside of the 96 members of this House and the officiais, a
very limited number of people read the
balance of the 2,000 copies. Then, six
monthe after the close of Parliament, 400
copies of the Revised Edition are bound
in volumes for the cenvenience of honourable members, -and sent to libraries and
other institutions. I doubt if, as a matter
of fact, half-a-dozen of those 400 copies are
rea.d; and they are not referred to, except
in rare instances. The other $10,000 je
spent i trsnslating the English reports of
speeches o! honourable members, ne matter
,how un-important they. me~ be, iito the
French language. Forty-five or fifty copies
o! the unrevised French edition are printed
and circulated among a portion of the
honourable members o! this House four or
five -weeks after the debate lis taken place,
snd, of course, after the full report bas
been printed ini English and aiter the sub-.
ject-matter o! the debate bas been finaily
deait with by this Houee. Thus it will be
seen that this dual-la.nguage verbatim officiail report canmot be o! an-y practical value
to even. the few gentlemen supposed te
be interested i it, and certamnly it is cf
neo value at aIl.te the country.
Hon. Mr. OLORAiN: Ie that seP
Hon. Mr. DENNIS: 1 venture to eaffirm
that neither thie House ner the coun'try
receives any vaiue or convenience cernm-ensgurate -with the cost o! Hansard; and
in my ju'dgment the expenditure o! .$33,000
a year for its publication le an unnecessary
snd unjustifiable expenditure at any tite,;
aind stiUl wor.se at this crisis i o-tr history,
when we are etaggering under such a
cruahing burden of taxes and debt, ?which
will be felt more next year and ini suoceeding y.ears than it is now.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: I thought the
honourable leader of the Governrnent would
be able te answer that question.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: It je for
the Houas.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: The Government of
the day «hould give their views. 0f course,
if the honourable leader of the Governrnent
does net reply. a member of the Opposition
will have to take hie place.
The principle o! this motion by the
honourable member f rom Halifax does net
appeal te the common sense of the country,
uer te its enlightenment. The press have
been during the paet twelve monthe pretty

631

well muzzled. I suppose the honourable
meruber from Halifax understands what I
mean. Now ,the honourable member fromn
Halifax, who did not have to be muzzled
through bis newspapers, cornes to Parliament at thie late hour of the session and
asks the Senate to muzzle itself. The proposition to my mind is infantile. Infantile
paralysis permeates the whole proposition.
The proposition ie made on the ground, that
the country will be saved some 820,000 or
$30,000. Honourabie gentlemen, what je
that in a budget of one billion dollars?
The honourable gentleman's motive je- a
correct one-very correct; it is te decrease
expenditure. Why does he net turn hie
eyes te other publications and ask the
Governinent to save net xnerely $20,000 or
$30,000, but millions of the public money
which. is yearly voted by Parliament to the
different newspapers of Canada and in
foreign lande? 'Why does hie not turn bis
attention te the advertieing in the public
press during the past twelve monthe, especially on one side, that is, the Union
side? How many papers will get, ýr have
already got, cheques for $25,000, $50,000,
875,000, $100,000 or $150,000. For whaît? For
advertieing purposes whieh are absolutely
useless £0 far as the general publie i. concerned.
The honourable senator from
Halifax who has propoeed thie motion
ehould be an authority on that question.
Hew much have hie publications in the
city of Halifax received from this Government in the paet six yeare? If he would
Mtate that te this honourable Houee, the
House would soon see that the 820,000 or
830,000 a year for the publication of Hansard
would be a mere fieabite in the bill.
Hon. Mr. DENNIS: Will the honourable
gentleman allew me? I amn unable to give
the figures that hie asks for in that connection, but I will aay this, that for every
do>llar zeceived oîn*e hundred, cents' worth
- of value has been given.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: That is a very good
proposition; and for every cent that bas
been epent in the publication of Hansard
and, oomparatively, for the one hiundred
per cent
of value given
by
the
honourable gentleman's publications, three
hundred per cent, if flot more, has
been given in Hansard. I will tell you
why. What appears in the newspapersand the honourable gentleman is one of the

will see the true heart of the man. Give me
a written document prepared, cogitated over
for days and months, and I will gay that
when the tongue speaks it is to hide the
thoughts within. ýSo whien the honourable
gentleman from Halifax stated that it was
a shame to have these trivialities, these
heated arguments,
these interruptions
recorded, I say it adds lustre to the tableau.
There is no tableau worth Iooking at that is
without jts littie bit of cloud. It shows in
its true nature the actual condition of things
that exista in a parliamentary debating:
society. That is the second reason for
which 1 oppose the proposition of the
honourable gentleman ta abolish Hansard.
Hie appeals to us to save a few pages. of
print a.nd a few dollars of money 'when this
very House is voting public money by the
hundreds of millions, and sometimes for
purposes that are not national and not
calculated to advance the best interests of
this country.
These are smaîl matters te have to deal
with, but a great foundation can be ruined
by smail things. A smail leak appears ta
be nothing to-day, but give it two or three
years runnin-., especially in a cold clîmate,
and yeu will have the foundatioii moulder
and fali. I consider that the attempt of the
honourable senator frorn Halifax, although
well mooted, is flot in accordance with the
situation
which should obtain in thîs
Hanse, in the Hanse of Commons, or in any
Parliament of a free people. Very limited
considerations of dollars and cents cannot
weigh in the balance against the usefuiness
af records for pesterity. If we were
squandering
millions as we do for
ather purposes in the shape of public
contracts, public advertising and public
works. 1 wauld have something te say.
Under aillthe.se eircumstanices I arn not in
favour of the proposition placed before
this honourable Hanse by the honourable
gentleman from Halifax, and I do flot think
the people, when they corne ta digest the
question. will approve of it either. It is
easy te flabbergast and bamboozle the public by saving that the Senate is going ta
save twenty or thirty thousand dollars by
flot havinz Hansard published.
Why,
manv of them will thraw up their hands
at the suzgestion; but if they staved for
cne single hiour and examined iinto the
situation, niot hemi a small pecuniiarv point
of. view, but froni the point of view of
national usefulness, tbey would reverse
their opinion and nat agree withi the hancurable gentleman frain Halifax in de-

manding that this -House abolislu its
Hansard.
Hon. Sir JAMES, LOUGHEED: Hanaurable gentlemen, I had nat expected te make
any observations upon the subject before
the Hanse, because I was under the impression that the hanourable gentleman
who moved thiz motion would in all probability withdraw it, for many reasons.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: He will now.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED. Net because there is not menit in the suggestions
which he has made. The views whichi he
has present-ed have undoubtedly been
interesting. They are ef sufficient interest
te, command the very best attention cf the
Senate, and prabably ta suggest that more
vigaraus action be taken towards bringing
about the end which he desires.
But it
seems te me at this late heur cf the sessien,
with prorogation in view, and with a large
percentage ai menibers cf this Chamber,
probably two-thirds, gene home, it weuld
be very unwise ta take action upan this
matter without giving every consideration
ta what we are about te do. It seems te
me that -%e can scarcely take a step in
this direction wvitihe>ut tak-ing the matter
up onjointly with tihe'Houese of Cerumans.
It would be an anomaly ta abolish Hansard
in the Senate and yet have it in the Hanse
of Gemmons.
Hon. Mr. DENNIS: The Senate Hansard'
was es-tablished five years before that af the
Heuse ai Commons.
,Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The suggestion ta abolish Hanýard bas received
considerable attention, net onlv in both
Chambers, but in the public press and in
the public mind Notwithstanding this, 1
amn unaware ai any serions step having
been taken by' either Chumber since I have
been in the Senate, to give mature consideration te the question of abclishing it.
My idea would he that my hionaurable
friend at the next session cf Parliament should take up this snhject, and that
this. Ghamber sheuld appoint a comnmittee.

iwitli the reporting of the commiiittee Ftage
in Parliament. There seems ta be no gooýd
reason why the proceedings on a Bill in
Gomimittee of the Mloie- should be reported
any more than the proceedings of a standing committee. One is as important aý the
other. H-ence it seenis to nie that, upon a
pr.esentation of this consideration'to both
Chamibersz ai IParliainent, we miglît arrive
at a very much more econamic administration of the reporting of Parliameat than
we have at the present time. If the coinmittee stage were not reported, -it seems to
me -that il. would. shorten tîhe sittings of
Parliament very considerably. There is n0
question but that many members, particuiariy in the House of GCommons, deliver
themseves of general views upon ail questions because of the greater latitude allowed in committee than in the bouse, and
thusý the sessions are proionged froni day
to day, fromn week.to week, anîd even from
month ta month. The xeporting in committee, in my judgment, resulted in the develupnient of the obstruction of Parliament in the
transaction -of public business. These are
features which might be very advantageouzly considered by a joint committee of
botl1 Houzes.
Therefore it seems te me
that it would be premature at once to take
action bv a vote on this resolution to-nighit,
owing to aur niot having digested the question as fully as we shouid, and I hope that
my honourable friend, in view of the importance ai the subject and the desirability
of giving every consideration ta it, will not
press his motion ta a conclusion this evening.
Hon. MIr. DANDURAND: I intended, if rny

Hon. Mr. POWER: 1 have always feit,
in dealing wvith a manufacturer or producer
of any article, that the best guarantee of its
quality was the fact of the producer putting
bis narne and address on the outside of the
package in leg-ible letters. I arn very glad
to see that it is proposed that that should
be the case hereafter in the matter of fruit."
In the case of apples, often the purchaser
cannot tell who packed them, or of 'what
grade the fruit is, and it is very desirable
in the interest of the consumer that the
naine and address of the packer, and the
quality and the grade of the fruit, should
be dist.inctly marked on the package. I amn
glad to see that that is to -be done.
Hon. E. D. SMITH: That bas been the
law for the last twelve years; ne barrel of
apples could be packed without the narne.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: If tbe statement
of my honourable friend is correct, apparently the law ha.s not been carried out, and
therefore there is something wrong in the
matter of inspection. Sonie years aýge ry
wife boug-ht a box o! fruit in Ottawa, and
on noticing that it was not properly marked
I drew the attention of the Department of
Agriculture to the tact; but. rnuch to my
surprise, the next time wve wanted a box
o! apples we were told that we could not

Hon. Mr. SMITH: There have been inspecters. and it lias been their business to
see thiat the lau "'as carried eut. I bave
neyer seen a barrel or a box of apples
that wvas net preperly markied, though
there niay have becen some soniewhere.
Hon. 'Mr. DANIEL: Is it usual for the

may he. Is be authorized t4o make the grade
himiself?

Hon. Mr. SMITH:

If he packs a barrel

ef apples in a closed package, se that the

consumer cannot see then, he must mark
the grade on the outside of the barrel.
Hon. Mx. DANIEL: He makes the g-rade
hirniself?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: He makes
the grade, but there are spe-cificataions provided by the Act which enable him te pack
them correctly.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: I believe it would
be an imprevement te have the date o!
packing as well as the namne of the packer.
As te packing- apples, I would like te say
te my honourable f riend (Hon. Mr. Smith)
thiat while the spirit of the Act may be
carried out, I arn sure honeurable gentlemen in this. House know the mxanner in
which a large portio.n of the apples corne
from Ontario, good apples are p]aced on the
top and the bottorn of the barrel. while the
apples between are very inferior.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: That is
human nature. You will bave te change
hurnan nature first before you can remedy
that.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: We want te make
this Act punish such packeis.
Hon. 'Mr. SMITH: That bas been done;
the punishment was provided; those who
packed apples in tha. way were hiable te
fine or imprisonmient.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: The present Act
prevides that every closed package et fruit
must be marked with the full namie and
address et the packer, and I have net seen
any fruit sold in the West witbout the
packer's namne on the package. Sometimes
the grade was net put on specifically, but
the name was there, or, if net, the inspectors had net doue their duty.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: That is it.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: It only remaineci for
any one te complain and caîl in the inspecter, and th-en o! course he would act.
Hon. Mr. W'ATSON: There is net miuch
object in aniending the law if the Gevernment is net geing te have inspectors
who will carry it out.
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: Let the inspectors do their duty.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: Last year we discussed a Bill for the inspection and stamp-

was that the stamping would ad-d greatly

season. of the year in the Montreal mnarket
we are inundated withi baskets o! white
grapes. They are delicious. WVill those
have to be stamped al-so? I have known
thern to be sold in Montreal as low as 20
cents a basket. They ail corne in a bunch;
they seemn to ripen together. Are you going
to add the cost of inspection to a basket
containing probably a gallon and a haif
of grapes, or are you going to stamp those
as inspectedý?
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: If a producer is sufficiently enterprising to put
grapes on the market, even as indicated,
-hie will not. hesitate to comnply with the
obligation of stamping the package. He
could buy a rubber stamp for a very small
sumn; the cost is infinitesinual, and some
systèm must be adopted for the purpose of
protecting the public. It is difficuit to draw
a distinction between packages such as my
honourable frîend lias referred to, and
closed packages such as apples in barrels,
boxes, etc.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: IE subsection 2 of
section 320,. with regard to repacking, a
new provision?
Hon. Sir JAM\ES LOUGHEED: Yes.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The explanation as te immature fruit would apply

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: They can

Hon. Mr. POWER: Green apple6 are *bad

Hon. Mr. WATSON: 1 think pears are
imported in a very green state, and sornetimes they have to be kept in the sho.p
for two or three weeks before they are fit
to eat.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Some have to be
kept three months.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: My hionourable friend must keep in view that ibis

that the immature fruit must not be piaeed
on the mnarket when it is quite apparent that
it c.ould not be used advantageously; that

it can be« used for eating or for cooking
purposes, it is not immnature fruit.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: It is fruit that
lias not yet ripened.
Hon. '-\r. BOSTOCK: I take it that in
the case of pears and some of the other
fruits mentioned here, which have to be
picloed on the greený side in order that Vlhey
may arrive at their destination in proper

and any one could u-se a barrel larger than

639

penalty anywhere in the Act for violations
of the provisions cf sections 322, 325 and
-326. Section 322 deals with branding, 325
deals 'with the dimensions of barrels, boxes,
packages, etc., and 326 deals wîth the contents o! bearry-boxes, etc. I notice that
those sections have ne sanction wh?'tever

Hon, W. B. ROSS: Section=.2 doec net

is the good of our passing legisilation to

be sarbject te ne penalty.

INSPECTION

CONSIDERED IN~ COMMITTEE.

On motion et Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
the Senate went into cemmittee on Bill 19,
an Act te amend the Inspection and Sale
Act (food containers, firewood and cernent).
Hon. Mr. DJaniel in the Chair.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: 1 ask
the conmnittee te permit me te call %vithin
the Bar Mr. B* rnes. who is an officer of
the department. foi the purpose of explaining- this, Bill.

Hon.

LOUGHEED: This
the varieus packages

and recept.acles referred te in the Bill as

"containers," and defines how they shaHl
be marked, which is a matter ot increasing
importance te the consumer. Representatiens are madie te the departrnent lrom time
te tinie as te the desirability et legislating
along these hunes, se that. the public may
be assured of getting what they psy for.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK: These clauses are
entirely new and in addition te the present
Act, as I understand il.
Although niy
honourable friend has net g-iven us very
mù,ch information, I presume there bas
been a demand muade on the Government
or 'the department fer this legisiatier. It
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED.

seems to me that this clause is very wide.
It says:
Every can. carton, bottle. box, barrel, w rapper,
packi.ge or closed receptacle of whatever deccription, hereinafter called "the containers.'
containing humran food or any other commodity.

The words "any other commodity" seem

to be very wide. 1 have not very much
inforrnption about the matter, but 1 should
think this provision would cause a good
deal of hardship. An article like a littie
packet of tacks might be looked uýpon as a
commodity; and to say that a man has to
put his Christian name and hi& eurname in
full on every packet of tacks is carrying
things to a rather extreme point. I cannot
find any definition of the word "commodity"
in the Act, and I think it would bear the
construction which I have put upon it.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: Before we proceed
further with the discussion of this clause,
I desire to renew the suggestion made by
the leader of the Opposition yesterday, and
urge upon the leader of the Government
the desirability of suspending for this year
the consideration of this Bill. I quite
understand the motive that was in the mind
of the tframer of this Bill, and, so far as
the Bill itself is concerned, it niight, if

In order that the leader of the Government may thorougbly appreciate the 'position which I take, I would cal] bis attention te section 358A, which is as tollows:

Now, I submit te thie honourable Hanse

aimed at by the man who framed tire Bilh.
lit may be at some future time desirable
that thia Hanse, having had an opportunity

whether there is any sucir wrong as eure]y.

That is ta say, we require ta j>rotect the

that a.re te be sold at home, but es te gooda
to be'sent abrond we do flot care whether
the packages are properly filled or flot,
whether they are properly stamped or not.
or whe'ther the articles are good or bad.
lIt seems 'to me that if there is any
necesuity for having the goods branded and
the name of the maker placed on the package, it applies quita as much, or more, ta
goods thiat are sent out of this country upon
which the good name gnd the credit of the
f armera' and people of Canada -depends a
great deal more than upon the goads that
are made for home consumption. I mention
this point only to show 'that apparently
this Bill has flot been given that consideration which ite importance requires.
1Section 359, referring to. firewood, provides:
359. Wood when sold or affered for sale ln
Canada as fuel. other than mlli scrap, kindlings
or other miii refuse, shall be said by the cord

or fraction thereof. and every cord shall contain

orne hundred and twenty-elght cubie feet, closely and, fairly viUed, whlch. eeasuremnents shall
form the barle of ail transactions for the sale
af woad for fuel, and ail sales mnade shall be
for a full cord or a fraction thereof.

In other words, it would seern as though
this Government had made Up its mind that
the farmers of Canada must become experts as wood-pilers, and if they lail 'to do
so or if they inake a mistake cf a stick or
two in a cord they will «et into trouble.
But there is enother clause which. shows
that the drafter oi this Bill does flot meen
what he says, for section 359B provides. that
" notwithstanding anything in 'this Act,
wood may be sold otherwise.than by the
cord." The firat section dealing, with fixewood says tha-t every cord of wood .sold or
offered for sale must contain sa many cubic
feet,- while, aocording to the last section,
you *may buy firewood by the load, by
tihe wheel-barrow load, or -in -any way
you hike; it does not *maker any difference whether you buy it by -the cord or
net. lIn these itwo classes there is evidence
th-at the drafting of the Bilh has flot had
the consideration it deserves.
Section 360 refers te Porthand cement. I

SENATE

A&s every honourable gentleman knows,
cernent iýs sold, in Canada at 874 p&unds to
the ibag, and the Amerîcan weight, from
which 1 presumne this clause is copied, is
94 pounds. Now, if -the farmers, *by this
legisiation. were going to get 94 pounds of
cernent instead of 87J I a-hould vote for this
Bill and tell themn to be careful about their
cordwood and the other requirements of
thie iBill wh.ih would, in My opin'ion, impose hardship upon them; but I -have not
f aith enough in the cernent manufacturera
or dealers to believe that they will give 94
pounds of cernent inste.ad of 87j, just because Parliament 'declaree that 94 pounds
8halI be put ink.o a bag. The -bags new in
use in this country, -and in the hands of ehl
the dealers frein one end of Canada to -the
other, con'tain 87J pounde. Theee bage were
made up, and the wholes-ale dealers and-the
cernent
manufacturers, have paid for
them
because
they
were
of
the
aize prescribed iby tihe law of t~he
coun.try.
And now, forsooth, Parliament would declare, "«You must put 94
pounds of cernent into every bag," though
the bag will hold only 874 pounds. 'I
understand that at one time there was a
clauýse in this Bill which Ïhas been @truck
out ci thie Bill but wb.iéh proihibiteh the
hens of this country £romn haying amal
eggs; that there was criticisrn of the amal
size of some eggs, and the 'farmers and the
hens were going to be compelled. to produce
an article of superior character. I fail to
see that there is more consistency in the
clause. which was heft in -than in tihe old
clause which, was struek.out in the lower
House.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: The National Pohicy
increased the size of eggs.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: The weight of 874
pounds of ernent ha-s been use-d in t.his
coun.try as the basis in ma.nufcturing ernent bage. It ie well known that in rnixing
cernent for roads, sidewalks, barns, etc.,
the proportions are one part of cernent,
three parts of sand and five parts of atone.
That is to say, 874 pounds of loose cernent
is as nearly a cubie foot as any weig.ht
can possibly be. The farmers of this
country have ueed eernent eo. long, and axe
eo accustomed to the qua.ntitiea that have
been stipulated to them in connection with
the màxing of cennt, that it seexns to. me
it is, a mistake for us to require themn to
readjust their figures, when, as they know
perfectly well, they will have to pay for tihe
increased size of bag an additional price.
Moreover, every honourable, gentlemen in
Hon. Mr. FOSTER.

this House-who ha& used cernent knows that
when the cernent is being delivered by the
manufacturer, a certain amount of cernent
sifts through the bag when it is loaded on
the wagon. It is landed ini a warehouse,
and in being re-handled more cernent aîfts
through the bag. It goes to the retailer
in the country, and froin hum to the fariner..
The f armer throws it on the ground, mid
more cernent gets through the bag. Somebody, without having any just cause of
complaint, rnay find that through careleas
handling there is, a bag or 'bag. -short of
the amount called for 'by this Bill, and

somne one wouhd get

ito. trouble.

These arguments which I have put before.
this honourable House will, 1 amn quite
sure, satisfy honourable senators, that,
while at *orne future tirne such a Bill may
be considored in the public interest, we are
not to-day in a position-we have not the
necessary information-to enable us to
apply to this Bill that intelligent opinion
which we should have after confererices
with the people whomn we reipresent, and
after giving it careful consideration ourselves. I suggest to my honourable friend
(Hon. Sir James Lougheed) that he
ouglit not to ineut upon the enactment of this measure, in view of the
position which I have described as that
which the farmers o! this coun.try wiah take.
The B-il
wouhd, among other thbngs,
compel every farmer ini this country, in
order te comphy with its conditions, to provide hurnaelf with a scale, if he lias none
at present.
There are hundreds e.nd
thousands of farmers ini this country who
have not a scale on their premises. Honourable gentlemen may say they shouhd have
one, and I presurne they should; but this
is no time to put additional burdens on
them-iii this respect. I-t is true also that
there are many thousande of farmers
whose scales are flot perhaps adj'usted with
thgt degree of accuracy with which they
should be, or in ordinary Urnes would be;
but, in addition to the other arguments. I
respectfully submait to the honourable
leader .of the ¶Ieuse that no sexious Iliam

of the Oppoisition, in which 1 concur.
«Hon. Mr. TANNER: Do 1 undera'tand

speoiifying by Act of Parliament or by
regulation the standard sizes of packages,
standard contents for those packages, and
standard qualities for the goods in the packages, is 'the proper system. Part of this
Bill provides for such standards in certain

judgment goes -about the maLter in the
wrong way. Though in general the Bill ie
ahl right, it bas many features, even ýas ît
now stands wiVih which I carmot agree.
When the Bill wais brought, into the House
of Gommons, iL was totally different from
this one; but the Hou-se of Commons riddled
it to pieces, se thet it cari hardly bu
recognized ais the same Bill, which. shows
that it .had not been welh coeidered, in
maiiy respects, when it wais in.troduced.
The question le, what ie, the best way te
protect the consumer? This Bill provides,
first of ail, that the packer shall put his
name and addrese on the packages. I
agree thoroughly with thaLt; no ene should
put out a closed package nie& he
bucoines responsible i aome way for its
contents, and wben the packer's niame and
address are on the package it can bue traced

for prmnting the net weight on the package

consumer. But thexie La a way ten Limes
better than that, abaolutely- protecting the
consumer and at the same time enabling
the manufacturer to pro-duce bis goods
cheaper, while thia Bil] would cause them
to be, dearer. Every manufacturer who La
compefled to mark the net weight on every

fore passing any such drastic legislaticn as
is propused in this Bill, 1 think we had
better have provincial legisiation in ail the
different provinces requiring that potatoes
be put up in 90l-lb. bags. I suggest that
this Bill 6tand over.
Hon. Mr. OLORAN: Coming from the
same province, I 'heartily enzlorse the attitude assumed by .the worthy representative
of the Eastern Townships (Hon. Mr. Foster). I think he bias struck a keynote that
is not only popular, but just and fair. He
voices here the needs of the farmers, and
he has put forth a defence whic'h I think
this honourable House oug'ht to lîstexi to,
and accept. He speaks witb persorial
knowledge. He is one of our leading agricuiturists, although a lawyer in that province, and he knows full well whereof he
speaks. The objections he made are not
against the Bill as a whole. He bas objected to certain provisions, and tlhere are
certain provisions in this Bill that are
simply foolish, if nlot worse. For instance,
he talked about the service of milk in samal
municipalities and villag,<es; and let me assure him that mil.k sold in the large toýwns
and cities like Ottawa, Toronto and Montreal, where there are many dainies, is put
up in quart bottieE, pint botties, and halfpint bottles, the last-named bein- us-nallY
used for cream. These botties cannot be
stamped, cannot be branded.
Hon. -Mr. BOYER: Why not?
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: I wil1 tell you why.
There is a reeiprocity amon- ail farmere
and dairymen in regard to Ubttles. I buy
a bottie of milk to-day from the Ottawa
Dairy Company; to-niorrow I -buy ftom the
Fairfield. Dairy; when 1I buy my eecond one.
I band over the bottie of the Ottawa Dairy
Comipany, and the other man has te take
it. There is an interchange. You cannot
compel. the people te çbuy fro'm the same
peTSOn aIl the tirne. The contention of the
honourable gentleman in that regard is well
founded. There are other products of farm
labour and other items of produce which
cannot be estam.ped, such as ma-ple 6ugar
and maple syrup, as bas already been mentioned. But the most serious objection that
I have to tbis Bill is to the provision which
encouragea d-iehonesty on the part of the
producer and the manufacturer. Where dues
the djshonesty lie in this Bihl? It is in section 358i which compels honesty on the
part of the manufacturer and producer whien
the goods manufactured and prod.uced are

sold in the United States or otber foreign
counitries. If that is flot an incitement to
dishonesty, 1 do flot know wbat it i6. Why
make a distinction for the benefit of the
home consumer, and flot for the ?oenteft of
the foreign consumer? Do you imagine for
one moment that this co.untry de.pends upon
honte consumption to increase its revenue
and wealth? No. We have scarcely 7,000,000
of a population in Canada, and there are
sufficient -goods produced fromn the soîl, the
fore6ts, the mines and the sea not only for
a population of 7,000,000, but Ïor a population of 27,000,000. What are we doing todayP We are feeding the millions on the
other side of -the sea during this cruel war.
The Government hias 1been badly adviied
in aceepting this clause, which says that
you must be hontest in dealing with home
consumera, but you may do as you please
with the foreign consumer. I hope the
House will seize the point, weigh it, and
ask if it is to the honour and credit of
Canada that such legislation should bie
paz-sed. How can a foreign consumer talce
our.goods when hie knows that'by statutory
law passed- in thi6 Parliament frauds eau
be per.petrated upon him, whîle the home
consumer is protected? Are we going to increase our expo'rt trade -by legislation of
that kind? I hold that we are not, that this
clause is discreditable, and that this hionouraible House ought flot to be a party to
pa-ssing it.
These are a few of the objectionsl to this
Bil.l. AsQ bonouratble senator from Wentthe
wortb (Hon. Mr. Smith), who epoke so
~wel.], &aid, there are many good points to
this Bill, 'but there are many ýwrong ones,
and the Bill ought flot to pas6 to-day. It
should -be held over, and some one wbo bas
common sense and common, fair play in bis
nature should draft a Bill.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE: You should do
it. yourEelf.
Hon. Mr. CLORAN: 1 would 'be a pretty
good hand at it. You would get fair play
and honesty.
Like many of my horicurable friends on
the other side, I think tbe leader of thbe
Government wou]d be doing well if hie witbdrew the Bill. It wouid be no defeat of the
Government; it would show wisdom in seknowledging that advice wel directed

Governnient. That is not a proper attitude for intelligent legisiators to assume.
The Government brings down this measure
and should, leave it abso]utely in the hands
of the represent-atives of the people te give,
their viE4%s, and should accept them when
they are proper. That i-s true not only of
this measure, but of all measur-es. That
is iny idea of government. There must be
some one to direct; but the directors, as
well as the team that bie is driving, should

Under the circurnstance-s 1 arn pleased to
endorse the, action of tbe honourable mnember frorn AIma (Hon. Mr. Foster), in requesting the Government to bold up this

Hon. Mr. FOSTER: Honourable gentlemen, I arn encouraged by the interest which

only because I think that justice will be
done to the people immed.iately interested,
but for the additional rea son that iît may

During the winter time 1 saw a load of

of hard-wood cut lu about 16-inch 'lengths.
Ha sold it by tbe load. A neighbour of

that it looked to be a splendid one. He
said: - I will order some of that; how

not know; about 115 cubic feet, I think."
The man brought the wood and it was put

promises at the time. I went and Iooked
at the wood, and I isaid: -"You have not

Hon. Mr. CLORAN: It is a question of
honesty again. Did the seller guara.njtee ta
the purchaser that there were 115 feet?
Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: No.
Eoýn. MT. OLORAN: How didi ho &-eIi tby the cord?

Hon. Mr. BRADBURY: Some honourable

Hon. Mr. POWER: I should like to ask
a question of the leader of the Government
on a matter which I suppose interests all
of us. It will be remembered hy gentlemen
who were mienbers of the House last year
that the Cornnittee on Internai Economy
recornmended the purchase of a new black
rod to take the place of the one which was
destroyed. by the dire. The comrnittee took
a liberal view of the matter, and, having
due regard to the dignity of this House,
decided to have a very superior black rod
prepared. Now, I have seen it stated in
the newspapers that some public body in
Eagland have decided to present a new
black rod to the Senate of Canada, and I
think we would naturally like to know
whether that report is correct or not.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: Communications have been received Irom the
Secretary o! the Empire Parliamentary
Association, which, as my honourable
f riend knows, is an Imiperial organization,
intiniating their desire to present to the
Senate o! Canada a black rod. Upon the
Prime Minizter reaching the other aide,
which we hope lie will do 'safely at an early

day, certain members of the Iînperial

-On -the Ord-ers of the Day:
Hon. Mr. jD WARDS: ,May 1 be permitted, to make a short statement for the. henefit
of the Department of Trade and Commerce,

Bi1l which. was before us this morningP
During the short discussion this morning
it was stated that it had beén ascertained
by tbat Department that the bags
ini
tion would hold ninety-four pounds. quesThat
is true if the bag is packed by hand very
carefully. But that is not the procedure
followed. nor could the company afford to
fill their bags in that way. Do flot make
the mistake that so large and important
a company as the Canada Cernent -Company
are going to buy one inch more of material
than they require. They are flot such fools.
The bags are filled by machinery, and al
that can.be put into them by machinery

CANADIAN NORTIHERN RAILWAY BILL.

READlING.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the
third reading of Bill 87, an Act supplementary to, ehapter 24 of the Stattutes of 1917,
respect ng the Canadian Northern railwsy
system.
HEon. Mr. BEIQUE.: I rise, flot te oppose
the third reading of this Bill, but merely to
eall attention to an important statement
which has been, placed on the Table of this
Hlouse by the honourable leader of the
Government. I think il might serve some
uaeful. purpose if eome extracts fromn this
statement were plaoed. on the Minutes of
this honourable -House. The first sheet is
under the iollowing titîs:

amount guaranteed 'by the Dominion
Government is $104,613,000-1 do flot include
the odd. fig-ures-of whioh $32,943,000 have

province of Manitoba is stated to ho $25,8--U

662.000, of which $ 1,620,000 has been pledged.
The amount guaranteed by fhe, province of
Saskatchewan ie staited to be $14,884,000,
of which $6,854,000 are pledèed. The amount
guaranteed by the Alberta Government is
statéd te o e$ 18,950,000, of which $4,139,000
ùs pledged. The amount guaranteed by the
British Columbia Government is stat-ed to
be $40,157,000, of w.hich $15,131,000 18
pledged. The 'total amoint guaranteed by
the provinces, exclusive of the amount of
$104,613,000 guaranteed *by -the Dominion
Government, is $107,514,000, of which $27,746,000 la pledged.
Then ve have -the ungýiaranteed eécurities to the amounit of $147,803,000, of which

been pledged.

*There are also note issues--six per cent
and five per cent notes, nearly ail niaturing
i July, Augut and September of 1918amunting te $33,673,000. Ineluded in this
-total, however, are an Reme of $2,190,000 for
notes maturing in June, 1919, and an item
cf $2,500,000 for notes maturing in. January,
1918, and Jannary, 1919. This gi'ves a grand
'total of eecurities' guaranteed by Dominion
or provincial governmeLts of $359,931,000,
te which 1 .think has te be added 'the $33,673,000 whjcb I have mentioned.
Further, there appear te be about $25.000,000 of Canadiean Nortbern Railway five
per cent inceome-charge convertible debenture ËStk, and another item of 314,846,500
for Imperial Rolling Stock Equipment
Trusts.
Then, under the heading, -Canadian.Northern Railway eatem, statement of

which wiIl mature li June, July or Septomber of this year, and -a loan of $1,250,000
maturing on January 10, 1919, total $55,-,
437,274. In addi-tion, there are notes issued
in England t, -the amount of $9,733,333, and
another amount of $2,190,000, the total
amount of these boans being $67,360,607.

&ecurities appears, te crange froin 43 te 80
per ceBnt of their face value. From. the statement which was made yestorday, I think,
by the honourable leader of the&Government, I infer that in consequenceocf the
taking over by the Government of the stock
of the Canadian Northern railway, aIl those'
securities will ble paid in full. It will ibe
seen that the holders of these, securities will

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Exactly.
Hon. Sir JMMES LOUGHEED: But my
honourable friend stated they would get
$20.000,000 more than the face value.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I say thsit if the face

Hon. -Mr. BEIQUE: I will comment on

as $15,335,189.56. Then there is an, estixuate
of the requirements for the year 1918, totaling $25,000,000.
Now, I have only two remarks ta make
with reference te this statement. Firist, it
6eerne ta me that a door ie opened ta the
formation of synidicates-for the puirpose of
puirchasing these secuiritiee at their ma.rket
value, with a view ta obtaining the par
value of the secuxities at a future date.
This ehoald not takeý place, and it ee-rne

upon the course on whieh they have

Hon. Mr. BEI4QUE: The honourable

notes-arnoat aIl demand noteès-amouaxting

amountmng te $67,%60,000. There are collateral securities pledged for the payment
of those bcans, amounting ta $69,446,000.
Wheu the Governernent cornes ta pay these
notes, amounting ta $33,000,000 and $67,000,000, it wii e, it seems teanme, the duty
of theGovermnent ta he subrogated te the
rights cf the creditars. These securities of
the -Canadian Northern, in ma.ny cases, 1
arn sure, have been pledged with the
bankers by persons who are primarily liable
for the debt, and there are a number cf
cases, I arn quite sure, wheie there are
other securities. It seerna ta me that it
would .be the duty cf the Governmeint
tawards the' country, ini di2charging that
indetedneffl, to take the place cf the creditars in oider that the Governanent may in
the interest of the. country exereise such
recaurse as mnay be fa.irly exercised against
ail parties primarily liable for those debts.
Hon. Mr. CHOQUETTE: I just wish to
remark thât, in liatelring t4o the long, sad
enumeration cf liabilities and provincial
guarantees, all fair-rninded men must conclude that this transaction is etili mare
deplorahie, if not. more soandalous, than
we ever thought it was. 1 cannat but recaU
with regret that 'when. some three years
ago, Mackenzie and Mann were aalcing for
an advance of $45,000,000, the Senate did
neot aocept the mation whieh I made,
asking for a straight and square inventary
or statement cf the liabilities of the Canadian Narthern company before granting
the $ 45,000,000. If at the tirne su-eh a
statement had been dprepared by ex,perienced men, I think the country would
have been saved at least that $45,000,000,

been spent; and 1 amn sure that. having an
.inventoVy of the liabi1ities of the road, we
should. have seen ithat not more than twothircis of ,that maoney liad really been. spent
on the road. We should have learned al!
those things. But, un.fortunately, members
on bath aides of the House voted againat
th, amendment 'which. I .moved for an
investigation_. only about 20 members
-voting in favour of it.
I must point out, moreover, that the
province of Quebec ifever gnaranteed one
cent of thase millions. That province lias
paid a very large share of the coate.o bath
the --Canadian . Pacifie railway- and thé
Canadian Northern.
The, province of
Qnebec neyer teok any responsibility for
the. Canadian Northern and did not profit
by it, ercept the Quebec and Lake St.
John railway, for 'which the Quebec governiment has paid hundreds of thousands of
dollars; and, therefore how unfair it is for
that province ta Ïb. loaded now with a
share cd the Canadian Northern debt.
.,mounting te, nes-,ly $100,0Q,000 1 Il is9 onay
right ta 'recail lie.. facts ta show this
honowable House how fair was myprpoi
tion mnade a f ew years ago, that an investigation, be.held before the $45,000,000 shouid
be granted, in order ta ascertain how ail
the. money gua.ranteed by the provincial
governments had been expended. If that
investigation had been held, &t would have
been asce'rtained, I repeat, that not lwýothirds oaf the. money borrowed from the
provincial goveranents by Mackenzie and
Mann or the Caýn«dian Nor'Liern had been
expended on the road. Il will ho seen iow
uni air and unjust it ia for the province of
Quehec ta b. loaded with sncb an enorinous
ahare of that debt, without having guaranteed one cent.

assmenLt commenicing at a shilling on
the pound. and going upto, six shillings and
<-igltpenc on the pound Sn1 the whole
net income, -without making any allowance
for interest on bondr or any provision for
dividends, so that the cornpany had Io stop
its dividend in order to pay $20,000 odd at
one lime in the formn of taxes i.mpoeed. At
the s-ame time, the Trinidad Government
provided in their iaw that the wvord
"ýpers-o-n" should include a company, inoorporated or unincorporated, so that it would
include a partnership; and. under the extraordinary powers that ail governxnents
are now assuming, they i6sued an Order
in Counci directing the assessor to colleet
from partnerehips as if they were individu.als, and to colleet from companies as
a~ unit. You cari easily ëee, in a progresisive
tax sta.rting at a shilling a.nd going up to
six-and-eig-htpence, how a par.tnership, by
splitting themselvets up into two, three,
four or five persons, could keep themselves
down to a tax of a shilling or two shillings
on the -pounid on. income. In the case of the
poor company, which consista of a lot of
smnall sharehoiders receiving froin $100 up,
only three or four receiving a large income,
bnd oniy one re-ceiving $1O,000, by massing
the ismali sharehoiders together the lowest
a.Qsesiient, at that rate o! six shillings and
eighipence, is more than ail the preceding

five assezmnenits runn.ing onie, Iwo, three
shilEinge. and so on up te te highest. You
can zýee how unjust that is-that a mari with
an incoine of £5,000 is getting off by.paying
two shillings in the pound, while the littie
sharehioiders are paying their percentage of
s; x-anid-eight pence in -the pound. That
kind of thin,« cannot last. and it is highly
de.sirable that the British Government, who
are interested in titat, and also in trade
b»eîwýeen the mother country and the colonies. and between the colonies tbemselves,
should try to arrive at soffne ýunderstanding
about t.hat, because, after the paynient o!

thik that Canada should flot follow suit.

661

Althougýh the United States and Great
Britatin act in that way. Canada is in a
totaliy different situation, for we are in
need of capital and are invitinga it into this
country; and in many instances it wiii flot
corne unless aocompanied by people who
intend to manage their own investments
here. We will be penalizing those people,
and thus preventing them froin coming
here, or chasinga them out ef Canada. When
we are at the beginning of our development, and need foreign capital, it seems to
me that Canada should have a different
poiicy, while Great Britain and t.he United
States can afford to apply their own views
as to taxation.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: 1 understand that
before the war it was the poiicy of the
British Government to tax the incomes of
residents in Great Britain, whether they
were derived frorn investmnents made in
England or in any foreign country, and
that the policy in the United States was
the reverse of that.
This was because
England was a iending country, while the
United States was a borrowing country; but
zince the wa-r the po6itions, of tho6e two
counitries have been reversed, and they
1 think
have reversed their policies.
we should take an example from England,
instead of adopting the policy of the United
States, because ;;: are and shal i be for a
long time. I arn afraid, a heaviiy-bo'r>winlg
country.
I draw the attetion of the.
honourable leader of the Government Io the
very eerjous iact that if Americans who are
hoidere of American zecurities are caied
upon to pay taxes, on them i.t will very
inuch impair the floating of Canadian
securities- in the United States, w-heee we
must.-gel mort of oui money if we 'want
to deveiop this country.
Hon. 'Mr. BOSTOCK: I would like to
cail attention to the position of the
perron who has his rnoney invested. in the
stock of a company and derives bis income
from dividends on that stock. 1 understand
that the conipany, first of ail, pays an
income tax on thiat stock; then a further
tax is pRid by the man wvho receives his
divîdends.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: But the
owner of the dividend does not pay the
normal tax.
Hon. 'Mr. BOSTOCK: No, that is paid
by -the corporation.

that he pays.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: 'Last year it was
considered eBquitable tiha-t, if the normal tax
were borne by the cempany, the shareholder
wvould pay the supertax; but now the normal

provision that corporations and joint-stock

"shall pay six per centum. ¶ipcn inceme

net be liable to pay the supertax or surtax."
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Yes, *but individual investors, those who hold the mortgages, genierally pay the normal tax of six
per cent.
Hon Sir JAMEDS LOUGIIEED: They pay
the six per cent, and then they pay the
surtax.
Frein the
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Yes.
sharehelder's income is first deducted the
company's tax, six per cent; then he pays
individually a supertax of two per cent, in
addition:
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: We had
better wait until we get there; then we
will discus that.

Corporations and joint-stock companies, no
matter how created or organized, shall pay the
normal tax upon incerne exceeding three thousand dollars, but shall fot be liable to pay the
supertax.

So that

is simply a contradiction of lanearning

Hlon. Mr. BOSTOCK: The next rise is
from $3.000 to $6,000, and on the rise of
$3,000 4 per cent is paid, bringing the tax
Up to $120 on the second $3,000, or a total
,01 $140 for the whole $6,000. On an income
of $10,000 a tax of 4 per cent is paid on
the next $4,000 and a further 2 per cent is
paid, bringing it up to $240 on that $4,000,
rnaking altogether $380. Then, in addition
to that, if I understand it rightly. under
this Act we pay a Vax on the tax. There is
a Vax of 5 per cent on $240, *rnaking $12.
So thiat the total tax that a man with an
income of $10,000 pays to-day is $3W2. 7hen,
on the n-ext, $10,000 to $9.0,000 there is a
Vax of 4 'per cent, making $400, and then a
tax of 5 per cent, amounting- Vo $50W, rnaking in ail an extra $900 to be added-. Then,
q-Žere is -the further tax of 10 per cent on
the tax of $900, which would arnount, to
$90, so that the total tax on an income of
$20,000 would amount Io $1,32.
In mak.ing a comparison, 1 ind that anyone with an in-come of $6,000 in the
United States to-day 'would pay $120,
whieh is, made up as foflows: undier
the old law in the United States he
paid $40, and under the new law Îhe pays
a further amount of $80, making $120.
Anyone with an income of $10,000 paid
under the old law $120, and under the new
law an additional $160, which makes $280.
The surtax is 1 per cent on an income
starting at $5,000 Vo $7,500, which amounts
Vo $25, and 2 per cent on an incoine of
from $7,500 to $10,000, mnaking another $50,
makingu the aurtax $75 on an income be.tween 35,000 and $10,000. So that in -the
United States under the presen-t law the
total tax on an income of 310,000 is $355 as
again st $392 which is Daid in Canada. To
continue the comparison: in the United
States, on an income of $20,000, under the
old law a maiî would pay two per cent on
income in excess of $4,000, which would
amount to $320; under the new law there
would be 2. per cent additional on the incorne ini excess of $2,000, which would
amount to $360. That represents a normal
tax on the income of $680. Then they pay
1 per cent on the income fromn $5,000
to 37,500, amounting to $25; thev pay 2 per
cent on the income fromn 37,500 to 310,000,
anioun.ting- to $50; 3 per cent on the income

the total Vax on an inconie of $20,000 iii the United States, under the law
at prezenit. ic $680. plus $25, plus $50,

plus $75, plus $100, plus $250, making a
total Vax of 31,180, as compared with our
tax of $1,382. That shows that in 'Canada
we are paying a hig-her Vax than they are
paying in the United 'States. 0f coursze,
this Vax does not approach the income Vax
in England, wvhich is a very heavy tax,
and one that we hope the people of Canada
will noV be called upon to pay.

Many other entries wili be tound of the house

the passage of a Bill at an advanced lieriod of
the session.
It Is quite regular, however, to
agree to amendments which "affect charges upon
the people lncidentally only, and have flot been
made with that object."
In order, however, to expedite the business
of the flouse. the Commons have adopted the
following

rule:

with that important subject, Bourinot was

1 must con!ess that, for xny part, froni
the time that I became a member of this
heonourable House until last year I neyer
gave proper attention to the question, and
was inclined to accept the opinion o! Bourinot or Todd as to the practice which
bhould be fobllowed, namely, that appropriation or supply Bills could noît be
amended by this honourable Hou.se. But
when the honourable member from Middleton <Hon, W. B. Ross) last session drew
our attention to the very important distinction whîch exists between our written constitution and the usiwritten conetitutien cf
Eng-and, his eta-temenit acted as *a llash
of light thrown on the question, and I arn
quite sure it became apparent to at least
aIl who are members o! the legal professioni that the honoura-ble inember from
Middleton had seen the question from a
new angle, and thmt it deserved verv
serious consideration.
That is what
prOmIpted the formation o! the cernmitteeappointed last year, and again this sessiont,
which bas flnally made the repoýrt with
which we are now dealing. Jmmediately
after the honourable gentleman fromn Middleton had drawn our at'tention to that distinction, I took the liberty oi adding a
few words to what I had stated a few
minutes before. I refer now to the Delbates
ef the Senate of last year, page 555May I be allowed te add a word to what 1
have already said? When I spoke first 1 tock
it for granted that It had always been assumed
by this flouse up te, this moment that money
Bis
were within the exclusive Jurisdiction of
the flouse of Cemmons. That la a practice
which lias been followed and upon which we
have been acting heretofore, with two exceptions.
Ever since I have been in this honourable House, 1. for one. have contended that
a Bill ma>* contain provisions which Pertain to

money Bills and Provisions which are foreign
te money Buis. in Cther words, I have clairned
that matters which, strictly epeaklng, shouhd
be covered by two different Bis could be unjted
in one; and I have clalmed the 'absolute rlght
of this House te amend such clauses, as 1 did
not consider that the3' were money clauses at
ail. I think that doctrine was adopted in this
henourable flouse on several occasions. The
other doctrine which bias been followed by this
flouse heretofere is. as stated by my honourable friend froni De Lorimier (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand, that-althouigh the Senate dealt
with clauses which were, etrictly speaking.

amendments and te send themn te the Flouse
of Commons; and as a rule these arnendments
are accepted by the flouse of Commons. That
ia what I intended'te suggest when I spoke a

665

few moments ago.
I must confess that the
honourable gentleman from Mlddleton <Hon.
W. B. Ross> has thrown a good deal of light
on the question, and, as presently adv'ised, I
must say that 1 think he is quite right. He hais
stated the unquestionable principle that the
I'arliament of Canada is not governed by common law, se to speak, as are the Imperial
flouse of Cemmons and the House of Lords.
They are net acting under any statutery ]aw;
they are acting under customs and usages,
whlch are the result ef long practice; but the
Parlianient of Canada Ia acting under a written
constitution and must remain within the four
corners of that statute.
So far as they are
withln the four corners of the statute they are
entitled to, exercise ail the rights and privileges which are given to theni by that statute.

Then 1I referred to the clauses which the
honourable member from Middleton had
xnentioned, sections 63 and 54 of the British
North America Act, the only sections curtailing the powers of this honourable House
in respect to nmoney Bis . 1 took the liberty
of referring to sections 17 and 91, of the
British North America Act, as placing this
honourable House on a par with the House
o! Commons as far as legisiation is concerned. Those are the rsections of the BriVish
Nor-th America Act conferring legisiative
power upon the Dominion Parliament

conslstlng of the Queen, an Upper flouse styled
the Senate, and the Bouse of Commons.
Section 91, under the heading, " Distribution of -Legisiative Powers-Powers of
the Parliament," reads as follows:
It shall be lawful for the Queen, by and with
the advice and consent of the Senste and
House of Cernmons, to make Laws for the
peace, order, and good governrnent of Canada,
in relation to aIl matters net ceming within the
classes cf subjects by this Act assigned excluslvely te the legislature of the Provinces; and
for greater certainty, but net so as to restrict

Section, It la hereby declared that (netwithstanding anything in thîs Act> the exclusive
Legislative Authority of the 'arliament of
Canada extends te ail matters comlng wlVbhln

Then, aiter enumerating these classes of
subjects which are conixitted to the jurisdiction of the Parliamntt o! Canada, the
section proceeds:
Such classes of subjects as are expressly excepted In the enumeratien of the classes of subJects by this .Act assigned excluslvely to the

This is really the section. defining the
powers o! -this Parliarnent, and it will be

other matters, but it entrusts t.he whole

tion of tiz Parliarnent to His Majesty, the
Senate, and the House ef Gemmons. Therefore 1 think, that, uniess we find some restrictions iii that Act, the two Houses are
placed on a par as far as legisiation. is concerned, Nwhether it be on one subject or
another. If one had to deal with this question merelv as a 'legal question, it seems toi
me that there could be no ground even. for
argument, because when a miatter is
entrusted le three different persons, and
they are treated on a -par, no preference
heing giveri teoene over the other, it goes
without saying that their rights are equ ai,
their jurisdiction i6 ýequal; and therefore
this Par:iament, according te the ext to
which I refer, bas jurisdiction equal to 'that
of the House ef Gomions.
But the question is some-what complicated,
nlot only because of what bas; taken place
in England, but hecause of the practical
way in which the English people deal with
ail matters, especially political 'mattems.
Although the text may be as clear as the
text te, which. 1 have called the attention
of the House, we find that the Privy Countcil, in dealing with the constitution of
Queensland as late as 1872, anid 'with a
text similar te that to be found in section
53 of our constitution, rendered a decision
-without hearing the parties or their counsel, and without argument-maintaining
that the Council ef Queensland was not
entitled to amend meney Bis. The Privy
Council, I take it, were influenced in rendering their decision, by the fact that in
Queensland they had swamping power, anid
therefore it was ini the power of the House
of Commons-or of the Legîsiative Assemnbly, as it was named at that ti-me-actirig
in enjunctioTi with the representative of
the King, te do there what was done in
England in 1911 by the Parliament Act-to
force upon the Upper Chamber the views
of the popular branch of the legislature.
And the Privy Council no doubt thought
preper te take a sho-rt-eut and maintain.
that the practice which prevail-ed i England should be the practice to be followed
in Queensland.
On examninirig the book4s which have been
N%-itten on this subjet. one finds that that
is thie pririciple foldowed by all the tvriters;1
and àt may be a proper prmnciple, because,
so long as the popular branch of the l-egislature has the power te force upon the
Upper Chamnber its own views, %vbatis te
use et exercising ýan adverse pow'er, e te
.peak, te that of the popular bramch? So
long as the popu1ar brandi, with the Crown,

te force its x'iewvs upon, the Upper Gharnber,

and te have its own, way. It is, in that
way that the House et Gommons in England forced upon the bouse of Lords the
practice which prevai]ed for a century or
two. and finally forced upen the Houise
of Lords the passing ef the Parlianient Act.
But in exami:ning that question one miust
aise bear thi3 ti mind: that the House
of Oommons in, Englarid îa a House of
Cominons in a unitary state, possessed et
most plenary powers, -go mueh se that
with the consent of the CTow-n they caii do
almost anything. For instariee, they may
declare wax w~ithout arrv regard te the
Heouse of lorde-; they m-ay declare almost
anîythirig, and the House of Lords would
have ne recouTse whatever, so long as the
Hou-se of Gommons acted with the asent
anid join-tly with the King, because the
Cabinet i6 responsible only te the &{euse
ef Gommoans.
That ie net the case with us in Canada,
because we have a written constitution;
and, unless te House et Commons, with
the consent ef the Crown, take-s the responsibility of disregarding the rigbts arid
po-e-ra et this branch ef Parliament, those
rights have te be respected. Even id the
Hcuse of Commona violated the cencstitutien, there would be a rem-edy before the
Courts, becauee their aéts could be assailed
as heing unconstitution-al. which is net the
Case in Engl-and, because ne courts cari
be called upon; at aný time, or on ariy
oocasien, te pa-ss upen. the validitv et the
action et the House ot Gommons witb the
as6ent et the Crown. 1 thin< that is an
important difference; and, if I arn net
mi-staken, it is, a distinction te which the
honourable member in his valuable memnorandum bas made ne reference.
Another very important distinction te be
made lies in the tact that under our
constitution the Senate represents different
intereats trom those represented by the
7
House et Gommons. W e have a Genfederatien, which ineans a uýnion et sever-al
Stat-es, fermed Jor the purp)ose etf prote-cting the rights of the s4.ates6 thus
united. Our constitution in that respect is
similar te that et the United Stéates, where
it is admitted that the Senate has the power
and -thbe riglit te deal with money matters.
0f course, olir position is net as strong as
that et the Senate et the United States,

while they are elected eitber by the people

samne, and it is -so hecause we in this
Senate, as they in the Senate of the United
States, are the guardians of special interests.
On referring to the Debates at the time
o! Confederation, to which the miemoranduin refers, it will be found that it was the
intention of the Fathers of Confederation
that this honourable Bouse should be
independent of the House o! Commons.
During the debates their attention was
d.rawn to the fact Uhaýt they were niaking
away with the swamping power, and that
therefore this branch o! Parlia ment would
be independent of the House of Commons;
and it appears freim the discussion that that
was understood at the ti.me the Act was
passed. The honouraible gentleman (Hon.
W. B. Ross), in his memorandum, specially
refers to reniarks made -by Sir John Macdonald, who was acting as Premier and
Attorney General, and who amongst other
things said:

The Crown cannot begin of itself any alterutions in the present established law; but it may

to better define the powers of thie House of

House. Section 53 of that censtitution
provides:Proposed

in the Senate. But a proposed law shaU flot
be taken to apprapyriate revenue or moneys, or
ta impose taxation, by reason only of its containing provisions for the imposition or appropriation of fines or other pecuniary penalties, or
for the deGnand or paymient or appropriation of
tees for licenses, or tees for services under the
praposed iaw.
The Senate may not amend proposed laws
Imposlng taxation, or praposed laws appropriatlng revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government.
The Senate may not amend any proposed
law so as to increase any proposed charge or
burden on the people.
The Senate may at any stage returfi to the
flouse of Representatives any proposed law
which the Senate may flot amend, requesting,
by message, the omission or amendinent of any
Items or provisions therein. And the House of
Repiresentatives may, if IIt hinloe fit, make any
of such omissions or amendments, with or
without modifications.
Except as provlded In thîs section, the Senate
shahl have equal power with the flouse of Representatives In respect of ail propoeed Iaws.

From that I think the Conclusion may
be drawn that when it was deexned proper
that the powers of the Upper House should
ba curtailed, the Irnperial Parlianient did
expressly curtai] those powers. The lInperial Parliament exipressly curtailed, the
powers, as far as ur own constitution is
concerned, by sections 53 and 54 ai the
British North kmerica Act. They did not
go any further. A iew years aiter, in deal!ne with the creatian ai another ýConfederatian, when it was thought advisable to go
further, they did curtail the powers in a
larger measure. I think it is ta be inferred
that if it had been advisable ta do ît in
dealing with the Canadian constitution it
would have been done, and that we cannot
import into our constitution anything that,
is flot in it.
Hon. Mx. DANDURAND:
Hianourable
gentlemen, I do not intend ta cover the
-round wlb.i the committee luis gone
ove.r, and which, in the main, appears in
the report which is before, this Chamber.
Aýs a mieniber of thait committee I concurred
the report and approved its concluLýi
sions. I simply want ta add a word un the
last question treated *by -my honourable
iriend from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique), when he spake ai the action of the
British Parliament in enscting- section 53
af the British North America Act, which
alane contains a limitation ai the powers
of this Chamber. That section saysBis for appropriating any part of the public
revenue, or for imposing any tax or iinpost,
shall originate In the 1-louse of Commons.

This represents the sole lim.itation of this
C'ham'ber iii dealinga wi'th inoney Bills.
Thiq limitation af the pawers ai the flouse

ai Lords was proclaimed by, the House of
GCommons in England as far back as 1661.
But the House of Commons went iurther,
and a few years afterwards passed a resoltition, in which they denied ta the H<>nse
of Lards the rig-ht ta amend money bills.
This resolution was in the terms ai rule
78 ai aur own Hanse ai Gommons, whichreads as follows:
Ail aids and supplies granted to fis Majesty
by the Parliament of Canada, are the sole gîftt
of the House of Commons, and ail Bis for
granting such aids and supplies ought to begin
wlth the flouse, as it ls the undoubted rlght of
the flouse to direct, limit and appoint in ail
such Buis, the ends, purposes, considerations.
conditions, limitations
and qualifications of
such grants, which are not alterable by the
Senate.

This aid dlaim of the House ai Gommons
ai England. which it has asserted for over
twa hundred years, has always been denied
by the Hanse ail Lords. It was reafflrmed
in England in 1861 by the flouse ai Coinmons, whieh went a step further and
asserted the right ta include ail financial
proposais in the annual supply Bill which
the Lords would be powerless ta, amend.
The Hanse of Lards declared that it shauld
nit be limited by the resolution which I
have just read, yet it conformed generally
ta the will ai the Hanse ai Commons. I
draw the attention of this honourable
Hause ta the fact that though in 1861, five
years -before the British North America Act
was passed, the Hanse o! Gommons again
salemnly de*clared that the Hanse ai Lards
had no power ta amnend mioney Bills; yet
when aur constitution was under discussion
and wace heing enacted, it ivas not the
powers ai the British flouse ai Gommons
as clainied by it only five years before
which. were included in aur constitution,
but simplY the first &tep, that ai 1661,
ta'wards Iiiniiting the -powers ai the flouse
ai Lords-t-he declaration that the right ai
initiative remained with the flouse of Commnfs and did flot belong ta the Hanse ai
Lords. The Hanse ai Commans could well
have gone a step iurther and vested in the
flouse af Commons ai Canada powers
similar ta those which it ciaimed for Itself.
It did nat do so. It wvent no further than
ta give ta the Canadian flouse of Commons
th-_ sole power of initiative.
The Hanse ai Commions af Canada at its
first session appointed a cammittee ta help,

and whichi denies the right et the Tipper
Chaniber to amend money Bis. This was
a rc-enactrnent of an old rule, adopted by
the Canadian Parliament at its first session
after the constitution of 1791, denying to
the Legislative Couneil the right te amend
money Bis; but the reason which
premnpted the House of A.ssembly to affirm
that right was based on the -fact that it had
the power to enferce it, because the constitution of 1791 gave to the Govei-nment the
right to appoint as many legisiative councillors at it pleased. The Crown retained
the swamping power by virtue of the constitution of 1791, and the House of Assernbly
could. then declare te the ýLegisiative Cotin.
cil what should be its limitations, because
in conjunctien with the Crowri it cou-Id, enforce its will upon the Uipper Chainher.
The House of Commons in England has
been in a simular position. Through the
swainping power it has aiways been -able to
threaten the Heuse of Lords with forcing
it to do its will and bidding ýby having the
Crown appoint a certain number of Lords
and by thus s-e-curing a majerity. But far
differeint is the situation ef the House ef
Copmnons of Canada. It did pass that rule

the Senate of Canada to amend money

It did flot; it was powerless to do se. Bince
1867 the Senate fiaè in very many inst.ancer,

Chamber for twenty years, and we have,
1 wiil not say at every session, but in every
Parliamnent, asserted our rig-ht te amend
money Bis, and we have amended them,
and the aniendments have g-enerally been
accepted by the Heuse of Commons. Only

ordinary Bill containing money clauses, but
the Incoine Tax Bill itselt. The annual

classes that have cerne froni the House ef
Commons te this Chamber. The definition
of our powers is in accordance net only
withi the text of our constitution, but aise
with our practice.
I recognize that an impression has prevailed in the Senate that there were certain
limitations to this Chamber's ri.ght to
amiend meonev Bis. When we -were acadeinically dis.cus.sing the powers of the Genate
in this connection without anyone seriously
study1ing the question, it was often said
that the limitations which the House of
Coiniiîons in Encland imiposed upon the
Hon. 'Mr .DANDURAND.

House ef Lords could in a sense be argued
against the Senate of Canada; yet we neyer
refrained in practice froni exercising oui
full rig-ht to amend meney Bis.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: Limîted practice.
Hon. '.\r. DANDURAND: My honourable
triend says. " nîiiited practice." Whenever
we were firmly convinced that a Bill needed
te be amended, no limitation existed in our
mind and we proceeded te make the amendment. We have, as I have said, refrained
only in the case ef annuai supply Bis.
.The right te amend money Bis, which
the House of 'Cemmons&by it& rule No.
78 denier to thi.s Ohamber, i& in generai
practice the sanie as the right te rejeet a
money Bill, which right is net denied the
Senate. The effect ef our amendîng a Bill
may be the saine as if we rejected it. WVhen
we amend a money Bill, as we have very
etten done, it gees back to the House of
Commons, and if the Cornmons disagrees
with the Senate and the Senate insists upen
its amendment, the Bill is dropped. It is
true that the Commons has then taken
the responsibiiity et rejecting the Bill as
aniended by the Senate, but there is ne
legaislafion passed, and the resulit is, the
samne as if we had rejectedl ihe M.IL.
Hon. Mr. DAVID.- Qui peut le plus,

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable

we couid apply this apherism, because in
reaiity we simply amend the Bill and do
net kilI it. It is the ordinary practice of
this Chamber te make an amendment when
it is feit that the Bill can be improved
thereby.

the population, but the provinces froin
which we corne; and I would ask, my
honourable friends if, in reading the
Quebec reésolutions and the federal compact, they do mot notice thet -the !financial clauses of the contract play a most
important role. If they do play an important role and if we are here to see that
the letter and spirit of that agreemnent are
maintained, does it 'neyt 'follow logically
that we have a special duty ta watch aver
the financial. administration of the country?
1 recognize that, .though we may have
equal powers with the House of Cornmons,
they shauld bie exercised by us in a different spirit. We have equai powers, 'but we
have not the sanye mandate. If the
Gommons. when acting a.cording to the
letter and spirit of the constitution, have
a clear mnandate from the country, their
authority should go unchallenged in financial as in other matters. Our duty, I 5mrmise, is ta assure ouxselves that the Commoins have that clear mandate. If in this
respect thie Sen-tle fulfils its duty .seriously,
it can play an important, a paramounit
part in the safeguarding cf the Fedexal
treasury. I dlaim that very often we have
been individually convinced that, the Coinmnn, in disposing of the money and tihe
credit cf the co'untry, lias not given suffcient consideration te the general interests
of Canada, and, in common with many of
the most praminent citizens of Canada,
who are concernied over the proper administration of the country, and whG

two-thirds of the people cf Canada, who

correspondence bas passed between the
officers of that delegation and the Governor
General, the Prime Minister, and the
Speaker of the House of Commons.
I regret that in the correspondence the
Prime Minister of this country treated the
farmers very curtly, while the Gocvernor
General exercised statesmanlike courtesy
towards that body. The requests of the
farxning ccenmunity of the, Dominion of
Canada were laid before the Governor General in a manner that showed that this

under sucb circumstances as now besert the

WVe therefore beg leave to remind the Blouse
of several Instances in whicb, it seems to us,
the liberties of the people and of their representatives have not been given sufficient consideration.
Twelve daye before the meeting of Parlianient
In January, 1916. the authorized oCanadian

No British army had ever been doubled without recourse to, Parliament. That it was done
In Canada caused students of British bistory to
enquire whether anything had occurred to warrant such a disregard of Parliament. Tbough
this House of Commons ha.s Inherited some of
the consequences of such an innovation, we
desire to confine Our respectful remonstrances
to more recent events.
During this session there were niota in the
city of Quebec. The flouse desired to diseuse
the serious situation thug created, and wae
er.titled to declare what measures might be
taken to prevent a renewal of sucb unhappy
occurrences. It did not escape the notice of the
country that immediateiy before the House
proceeded te discharge lie duty, there was put
upon the Table a completed law, in the forin
of an Order In Council, wbich arbltrarily took
out of its control the very question which the
flouse of Commons was about to discuss.
Later there were other departures from the
traditional practice of British law by equally
astonishing proceedings. An Order. in 'Council
Hon. Mr. CLORAN.

was given to the House as a matter of information providing for the registratien of the
buman power of the country, and setting up an
entirely new criminal code in connection therewith, by creating several methods of punish,
ment bitherto unknown to Canadian civilizatien. Surely such departure should not bave
been attempted In such a manner. Punishinents
created without the assent of Parliajnent naturally tend to provoke hostiiity. We feel we are
performlng a national duty In respectfu]iy cailing attention to sucb conditions.
The Order In Council endorsed by both flouses
on April 18th virtually sweePs away the Miiitary Service Act. The resentment It bas created
is known. to this flouse, inembers of wbich are
known to, regret that the elemnents of the constitution were Ignored in this proceeding; and
that tbe method of presenting a practically
executed decree, while wlthholdlng disciosure of
the facts on, whlch It may be based, cannot
easiiy be justified to, the constituente of a newlyelected pariament.
The curtailment o~f the liberty of written and
sookei, speecl. contained In the Order In Council given to the public on April 16th bas caused
especial concern to ail wbo are aware 0f the
bistory of free discussion in Canada and other
parts of the British Empire. We are sure we
need not beg thse flouse to examine lIs provisions In order toappreciate how a doctrine of
tbe essential Infallibility of the Gavernment may
bc forced upon a free people on pain of a fine
of flve tbousand- dollars and five years' isaprisonmen±. Tbe flouse, to our extreme regret, bas
been faced with a notification of tbe lntended
cuntailment of tbe privilege of a member Of
Panliament to declare his mind, and the rigbt 0f
bis constîtuents to know what be bas uttered.
That this unique warning te a freely-elected
British assembly was halted for several weeks
on the Order Paper, we venture respectfully to
attribute to you, Mr. Speaker, as the appointed
guardian of the liberties of the flouse and aise
of the people. It bas heen noted tbat the Prime
Minister, In withdrawIng tbe measure, viewed

Noýv, honourable gentlemen, you wilI al
admit, whether friends or boas of the Guvernment, that that was not the proper way
ta answer that delegation, representing
from three ta four million of people ai this
Dominion of Canada. The replies are not
only curt, but there is a want ai politenees
in them, and 1 charge him, as a minister
ai the state and Prime Minieiter cf this
country, with dereliction of duty in -regard
to this matter. This was no longer a private
document ta be pigeonholed and tlirown
mnita the waste-basket. Sir Robert Boraen,
the Prime Minister of this country, hal not
t.reated the farming cammunîty o! thié
country as they shau]d have been treated,
especially when they went about their business in a legitimate and practical way.
Seeing that they cauld gel na recagnition
there, they wrate ta the Speaker af the
House of Gommons, who used practically
the saine language, anly lie went a little
further and attempted t-o crit.iise the document.
The following is the letter fram the delegation ta Bis Honour the Speaker ai the

The Senate adjourned until tornorrow at
of the old British style. He laid that p,ýtition before his ministers on behaîf of the
Royal authority. WThat did bis mini.,ters
do? They concealed and kept secret that
petition. That is not the proper way for
a demo>cratic governinerit to deal with a
matter se essentially serious as thits. What
the Governor General was prepared te do
bis rninisters ought to follew, and take the
country into their confidence.
The correspondence covering the entire

the mind of a publie man. We have had
these documents unofficially, but 1 'would
like to put tbem on the records &e that tbey
would serve for future purposes, or, as I
said before in introducing the motion, for

having failed in the preliminary stage, wilI
find that it is flot yet too late to amend,

for the Government itself.

Hon. Mr. OHO0QUETTE: After consultation with my colleague, the mover of this
resolution (Hion. Mr. David), I wish te say
t.bat thie, man Desjardiius i& under trial
and'that his trial bas been adjourned until
next autumn. Although my opinion is that
this makes no difference, as we did flot
intend te discuss the trial-we rather put
the Government on itsi trial-I think it :s
only fair to have the question dropped for
this session, in view of the trial having
been fixed for nert faîl. With the consent

I move that this motion be dropped.

THE PENSION OF LIEUT.-OOLONEL
BRADBURY.
QUESTION 0F PRIVILEGE.

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. G. H. BRADBURY.- I desire to
caîl the attention of the House to a inatter of
privilege, a matter te which I would have
referred some tinie ago had it flot been for
the tact t.hat I was expecting a statement
to be made in another place. It seeme
that the session is likely to close to-day,
and, as the matter has not been brought
up, 1 desire at this stage te say a few words
upon it. I refer to the pension which was
granted te me by the Board of Pension
Conunissioner. The Ottawa Citizen cf May
9 makes this statementPension Examples whicb. cause nmre Cqmmons
Comment-Senator is given 80 per cent
"Boardlng "-Mr. Bradbury, aged 59, Raised

Senator Bradbury was twlce boftrded. The
flrat board found hlm 75 per cent disabied from

competit4on "in the untralned labour market"
<be is in bis fifty-ninth Year), and declared
that two-thirds of this disability was du,- to
service. It, therefore, recommended hlm a fifty
per cent disabiiity pension of $69.40 per
month-

I would like te draw the attention. of
honourable gentl!emen to the tact thaRt this

-for the period of six months. Senatoèr Bradbury complained about the finding of the cornmissiOn's board and demanded that another Bit
on his case. The second board whlcb sat in
Montreal found hlm go per cent disabled, the
entire disablement being due to service, and
declared that the disablement was permanent.
Its recommendation bas not yet been acted uPOn.

I desire te say, in the first place, that I
neyer demanded a second board; lu tact. 1
never demanded any board; I neyer asked
for a pension. I was boarded out as a colonel on leave, as every colonel who is on
leave wilI be boarded eut.
The history of tbe case is simply this. I
started te raise my battalion on November
5, 1915. I may ray to this honourable

678

SENATE

House (hat those who knew me, knew that
1 was neyer in bel<ter health in xny lii e,
and I had been in good Iiealth for years
previeus to that. I raised this battalion,
,con.sisting of over 1,250 men, te full strength
inside of sixty days. I was ir: training
ail winter and -ail of the next spring
and summer. I took my battalion te camp
Hughes early i May of 1916, and trained
there until the latter days of August, before
I had the alightest eymptorm of any trouble.
That was, as you wili see, ten months
alfter I had enlisted. The inference te be
drawn from the way the Oitizen puts the
oaae ie that I had got oome special treatment. I think it is unfair that the press et
the countLry should take a -fing at a man
who has done bis duty, because hie is in
public ie, and inske it appear thai, either
as a rnember of the o4.her House or as a
seuator, I had got emre special treatment.
I do not think that a man should be penalized simply because he ie a anember of
Parliamnet or a Senstor.
Wjth ail due deference te wha, 'las been
raid ini another place, I desire to ernphasize
th.e fa.ct that I neyer asked for a pension;
I neyer aoked for a board; I never redused
te *he hoarded a second time. What teck
place was this: I was ordered by the military authorities to report te a board in
Ottawa. 'I forget the dates; they are immateriai. I reported te that board and was
examined in order that it might he dotermined whether I shouid be retired or kept
on leave. When I camne back to Canada on
the 25th of December, 1916, the firq-. thing
I did on my arrivai-I think it was the
second day after I arrived in Ottawa-was
to write a letter te the military authorities
asking them te grant me leave ef absence,
wvith the distinct understanding that 1 was
te be struck off the pay-list. That letter is
on record. Se 1 was a colonel on leave fer
nearly a year. The military authorities, in
the natural course of events, hiad Ie deai
%yith my case te see whether they sheuld
continue me on leave or retire -me; and
fer that puipose I was summenied by the
iiiltary au-thorities te appear before a
miedicai board. I did that, and when the
medicai board examined me they ascertained Rny disabiiity, and accerding te law
they had te report thait disability 4te the
pension board. The pension board could
do not.hing else than te deal wjvth the case
according te the pension list arranged by
Pari ament.
When the finding of that board was

,effect that aeome of my dis&bility existed
prier te the time I enlisted, 1 resented that
and went te Colonel Belton, ivho was, J
think, chief medicai adviser of the pension
board, and pointed eut te him that the
medical board had ne authority or justification fer making that statement, because
I was in the pink of condition. had neyer
been in ibetter health in my lit e t!iau I vas
when I undertook te raise my battalien, and
continued in that state of heal4ii for over
ten mont-Is alter I had enlisted; that 1 had
been in good heaith for 25 years previous
te that, exce'pt for a time a few years
earlier when, as honourabte gentlemen who
were then sitting in the other House xnay
remember, I was threatened with a.ppendicitis. At that tirne I went te Montrea]
and was exarnined by Dr. Lafieur, who
knew ail about rny condition, and who is
on record regardixig my present condition.
What 1 isaid te colonel Beaten, and I desire
te repeat it te tihis honourable flouse, was:
"Colonel Belton, I have net corne te you
in my own interest; I do net give a fig for
your pension; I have corne te you, though,
in the interest of 1,200 men whom I have
taken overseas, .and . I want to know
whether, when those mnen cerne back cri.ppied, or wounded, or rheumatic frorn their
hee.ls te their head, or suffering îfrorn lung
trouble or sornething else through. exposure,
you are geing te say te them: 'Yes, yeu
have a grea.t disability; you have 75 per
cent or 100 per cent disabiiity; but you mnust
have had some of that disabiiity prior te thle
time of yeur enlistment with the 108th
Battalion.'
I desire to say te this hionourabde Heuse and te the country that if
that is possible it wîli be a standing disgrace te Canada, because every one o! my
men-and it*was the samne with other battalions-were exaxnined -by my dector when
they joined the battalion before being
passed into the service. When, about six:
weekýs or twe menthe after I st.arted to
recruit, it was assembled at Selkirk, the
battalien was again boarded and any
defects existing were discovered and deait
with. Then, when we arrived at CGanp
Hughes, my battalion was boarded -by a
board selected by General Hughes, who 'was
the commander of the camp. The 1O8th
Batitalion wvas boarded. four different times
before it 'went overseas, and I think every
other ibattalion at camp Hughes was treated
in a isimilar manner. That baing se, hionourable gentlemen, 1 contend that this
country is in honeur ïhound. te accept every
one Mt thosec men as being fit, and znuet
aocept responsibility for any injuries these

mAY 23, 1918
men have received on eevice. It -will be
unf air, it will be *a disgraoe, to say te any
el those meni: " Oh, yes, you were injured,
you have a great disability, but you mnust
have had seine of that disabili-ty before
you wvent ove-rseas with Colonel Bradbury."
1 arn speaking no-w in the interest of the
men of ail battalions. As far as I arn
personally concerned, I do, not care a fig for
the pension. 1 say to the Governinent
froma my place in this, House that if Lhey
desire to change the ilaw and anake -it imnpossible for the colonel of a battalion. who
is a memaber of Parliament, or a Senator
ta partsicipate in a pensdon and wish to
penalize -me, do so. I will acquiesce; there
will be no protesi from me; and they can
mace the law retroactive il they wîs'h.
As te the pension itseif, as 1 stated a
moment ago, it is only a six-ijiontha
pension. I have neyer received one dollar
of it. A cheque for $69 and sorne cents was
indeed sent to mne, but the cheque is -lying
in rny deak at home. The papera calne
,to me wrongly made out-made eut to
"Lieut. Bradbury." I returned them unsigned, ansd I have neyer heard-another
word froun the authorities since.
I want to say a word to show that there,
was no justification for the position Colonel
Belton bas taken. There was. an attempit
made in t.he com.mittee that sat in the
other House to show that 1 thoughit there
was seine personal motive -in the action of
the board that boarded me first. 1 want
to -say that I did n.ot know one of the gentlenmen who boarded -me; I neyer spoke (to one
of theni in my life before that tinie. They
could have had nothing- agaain.st nie, and 1
could have had nothing against them. So
the inference that it bas -been tried to
create, that I refused te be boarded by
thern again, is absolutely unfounded and
unitrue. I had already been boarded by this
board two or three 'weeks before, and when
I made any protest against the finding I
did it, not on ny -own accounit, because 1
do net care about the pension, but because
I %vasthinking of the men I had taken overseas. It is not reasonable to suppose that
an appeal from that board would mean
an exaunination by the sanie board
again, but that is the inferenoe that
is sought to be created. There was
no suggestion of that kind made. Dr.
Belton did suggaest that I should bie
boarded by consulting physicians. InsÈtead
of -me demanding another board, as stated
in the Citizen, Dr. Belton states in bis
evidence that, instead of accepting the sugg-estion hie hnad made, I said that 1 would

679

take the matter into consideration. That is
exactly what happened. Two days after 1
made the statement that I would take it
into consideration I received a telephone
message froni the board asking me to go
before another board, and satating that 1
mighit be boarded at any place I liked, and
suggesting Toronto. I said that Toronto
was a considerable distance to go, and 'they
said, "How would. Montreel do?" 1 said, "If
you want me te bie boarded again, I will go
te Montreal." Two days after that I received the following wire froni the Militia
authorities in Montrea.l:

Dear Col. Bradbury:
Regardlng your physical condition which
1 have had the opportunity of observing since
April, 1917, 1 am of the opinion that the symptoms of which you complain for the last
eighteen months or more point to angina pectoris,
and I believe that thia condition neceasitates
your curtailing your activities as much as possible. I would advise you to avoid particularly
fatigue and physical exertion and worry ani
excitement of any sort. I consider that you
shouId be relieved of military duties entirely,
and that aIl you can safely undertake la attention to your business and your senatorial duties.

asked hini what cauQed the trouble, and lie
asked me what 1 had been doing. I said,
that I had raised a battalion, and he said,
"No doubt that is whiat eaused your
trouble." The board asked me to write a
letter to him asking- hlm to express an
opinion. Here is what lie says in his letter
of February 4, 1918:
Hon. George H. Bradbury,
The Senate, Ottawa.
Dear Sir:
in answer to your letter of February ist, I
may say that I believe the trouble YOU are
now suffering frora-angina Pectoris-had lis
and mental
origin In the physical exertion
worry attendant upon the raising, training and
taking overseas of your battalion.

I want to put that on record heeause of
the statemient that bas been madle, that it
takes at least-a year, likely more, for trouble
to develop.
There are one or two other stateinenits
ruade bv Dr. Belton, tci which I feel I rnt
refer. Speaking of -the board that had already exaruined ne, someone .asked hiru:
'«As a medical man would not you say that
the men w'ho had examined the man formerly and hàd passed upon his disability would
be ibotter able ic say whether he was better
or worse, on a subeequent occasion?" The
answer to that question -was " yes." The
inference drawn from that was that I had
declined ta go before the samne board, which
is absolutely untrue. There was no suggestion that I should do so. Then, again:
Speaking for yourself. you see no reason why
the medical board should not have re-examined
Colonel Bradbury?

A'nd the answer is;
Colonel, Bradbury did object

to that board.

I want te state niost emphatically that
th-at statemient is not correct. I did not
objeot, and hie did not suggest that I should
go before the same board again. The only
demur I made was when 'he sugg-ested, that

FIRST,

SECOND

AND

THIRD READINGS.

Bill 113, an Act te. aiend tbe Bills of
Exchainge Act-Hon. Sir James Lougheedwas oeoeived f rem the Hiouse of Cosumons
and read the first time.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED xnoved the
second reading of the Bill.
He "'~d:By this Bill k is proposed te
strike out cdf the Bis of Exchange Act the
words, "th.ree o'clock," ini 'the lest line,
and to insert ini lieu thereof the word.s,
"half-past twe cr'clock." This is to permiit
of the banks closiLng at iialf-ipast two
instead e! at three. Owing to the operation
,of the Military Service Act, and the judgment of the appeal court on exemptions
that bank clerks are by no crneans exempted
any more than any other class, tbe bank
staff s bave been so greatly reduced as te
create a congestion of work, involving thbe
necessity of working until a very late hour
in the evening. It is proposed that this Act
s.hail remaini ini force during the war and
o>ne year them-alter. Bila of exchange f al.ing due will have to, -be met at half-past
two inetead -of eat three ''lock. That of
course will not affect Ihonourable gentlemen. o! the Senate.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.: 1 have no objection
to the Bill, except that 1- bave not seen it.
l do not know whether other gentlemen
bave seen it or net. I ttLke the stateunent
of my honourable friend. I understand that
bank employees will.not be able to aveul
theniselves o! the Daylight Saving Bill.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: The Daylight iSaving Bill will in no way reduce

6B,

their hours of labour. They go to the bank
at the same hour, but owing ta the cong-estion of work brought about by war conditions and reduced staffs, it necessarily follows that they are kept until a very late
bour in the evening in order to keep up
with the work.
The hankers'
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
association has resolved to close the doors
of the banks at half-past two, commencing
on the first of June next. This is to allow
of that being done.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: 1 do flot want to
oppose the Bill; but it seems to me that
haif-an-hour may make a lot of difference
to a man in business, or to one just starting
in busineszs, in having bis -bis protested.
Hon. Mr. BOY ER: The banks will open
at 9.30.
Hon. WMr. CROSBY: Opening the banks
at 9.30 will not help very much if it takes
until three o'clock to get the money. The
last haif-bour is generally the most impor'tant, as I have no hesitation in sayin-,
from my own experience. I bave no desire
ta interfere, but 1 say that business men
depending upOS the.- accomodation- Of the
-banks and anxious to keep right with themn
sometimes find the last half-hour very
precious. I would not like to do anything
that would interfere with that.
Hon. Mr. ILA NDURAND: But the honourable gentleman knows that a debtor bas
-until 4 o'clock before bis note goes into the
bands of the notary.
Hon. M-Nr.CROSBY: This honourable
gentleman does flot know as much about
that as does xny honourable friend. Men
in his profession, when they get a license
from the bar, can get w-bat tihey like, but
I arn épeaking of the ordihiary every-diay
business man, wbo bas to fight bis way in
the world. I would be very sorry to do anything tha t would interfere with that clasa
of struggling men. We bave a lot of good,
true, faithiul business nmen in ail parts of
this country; but very often such men
could not find rny honourable friend by
half-ýpast two, for ihe would not be hack from
his lunch by thaý time; but they migbt, find
him at a quarter to tbree, and perhaps get
accommodation from hLm that would belp
them out of the difficulty for tbe time being.
Many a good man bas te go te his *friends
to help bum out, but tbe houx of 2.30 is so
close to the lunch time of tbe man wbo bas

the time for that class of business men.
Hon. Mr. BOYER: Do I understand rny
honourable friend to say that it is the last
liaur at the bar that will procure the
inoney?
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: There are no bars
now.
The motion was agareed to, and the Bill
was read the second tiine.
On motion of Hon. Sir James Lougheed,
t.he Senate, went into Committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Watson in -the Chair.
On section i time of protest changed
froin 3 p.m. Vo 2.30 p.m.:
Hon. Mr. POWER: WVhile I recognize the
force of the objections whichi have been
made by my junior coiheague from Halifax
Woa change in the l.aw, I think that on the
whohe the Bill is one that should go
throug-h. 1 notice that the Governmnent
has limited the operation of the Bill, whien
it hecomes an Act, to the period during
whichi the war hasts. Well, every chass in
the conimunity are obliged to niake sacrifices with a view Wothe successtul proseciltion cf thc war, and I do not sec why the
business men should flot do so as well as
others. But the principal reason why 1
favour the passing of the Bill is that as s
general thing the hank clerks iii this country, particularhy the junior cherke6, are
about as il-paid and about as hard-worked
as any class in the coinmunity, and I am
glad to think that the ad-option of this
change in the lmw will to a certain extent
iniprove their condition.
Hon. Mr. CROSBY: I kiid riot catch
what was said by the honourable leader of
the House, that this amendment was to be
in force only during the -%var. As the hionourable senior senator froin Halifax has
said, everybody has to make a littie sacrifice, and therefore I think that it is ail
right.
Sections 1 and 2 were ag-reed to.
The Bill was reported without aniendment, read the third time, and passed.
CANADA'S

MEMORIALS 0F THE WAR.
A SUGGESTION.

Hon. N. A. BELCOURT:
Before the
House adjourns I would crave a few momente to draw -the attention of lionourable
members, and particulmrly that of my honcurable friend who leads the House, and
rwho i6 one of the mcost infiuent.ial iieiiiHon. Mr. CROSBY.

bers of the Govern.ment, to a xnatter
which it see
to me lias not received ail the -attention it deserves on the
part of the Government. I refer to the
question of having prepared a full and accurate account of the efforts made by Canada during the present war, in order that
future generations may know exactly the
extent of the services and sacrifices which.
Canada has contributed to the great event
in which the -whole world is now interested.
For my part, I would like Wo see those services and sacrifices commemorated in a
substantial and permanent manner, for it
wil be hundreds o-f years belore interest
will cesse to be taken in the wonderfuh
tragedy of events which is being enacted today.
I have no particular suggestion to make.
at this moment, but I think -the xnatter
ought to receive the attention of thxe
Governîment, and something subetantial
oughlt ýto be done.
Tehe part that
Canada has phayed, and is playing tW-day
ini the war can be said without boasting.
to he as great as that of any other country
etigaged in the war, in proportion to ler
resources. in men and means; in soine respects it is greater than the efforts o! sone of
those countries. I amn net finding fault; on
the contrary, as Canada is probably the beet
hope of democracy that romains ini the
'world, it had a special duty and interet to
defend demooratic ideals, andi I -have al'ways
thoug.ht that Canada's share in this war
should be equal to that of any other country
enrag-ed in it; but I do flot Jý.now that we
are doing to-day in Canada 'what is beingdone in France and Engaland tewards cornmemorating in a fltting way the part taken
by the nation in the war. 1 know that something has been done in the way o! colleot,ing data for historical purp-ose6, to he used
when a comopetent %vriter can be found.
I know also that somns trophies. and cu.-ricaities of the wvar have been obhected', but
to what extent I am flot sure that the
public lias been tohd. I noticed a few days
ago that the British Government had
secured the services o! a Canadian, Mr.
Beckels Willson, to go to Palestine te
colleet data for the Imperial Governfnent,
not the Canadian Government.
One thing that I think the Can-adian
Government las not done which it perhaps
inight do, is the collecting of not onhy the
larger things auch as aerophanes, guns, etc.,
but the small curiosities that are to be
found to-day on the battlefields. The other
day I saw it stated, as I arn sure other
gentlemen niuct have noticed, that a

MAY 23, 1918
curious thing had been discovered by one
of our men in Flanders. He found a jittie
inetrument, a combination of telephone and
telegraph, that had been used by the
Germans. Collections of auch things are
of value not only from a historical point o!
view, or from the standpoint o! the interest
which we and our children naturally feel
in the great -event, but also from the scientific point of view. For instance, il such
a thing as a combined telephone and
telegraph has, been uced by the Gérmans,
we ought to know that; I arn sure our
scientisas would be very much pleased to
learn the experiences of Gersnany in that
regard, and they might posaibly carry the
invention one step or several steps further.
I would think that the Government would
be well advised in appointing men whose
special duty it would be Wogo WoEurope
and Wothe various battiefielda, in Africa,
Asia and Europe, to col.lect anything o!
interest..

that when the hietory of the war is written,

Honourable
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN:
gentlemen, on the proposition made hy the
honourable gentleman from Ottawa (Hon.
,Mr. Belcourt.) I would certainly have
desired that no discordant note should be
s9unded. The glory th.at the, war has shed
to
me
te
seems
on our country
be a pure ligbt, obliterating perhaps
the war
thaet
souvenir
sad
every
itsell may have brought te this country.
Everybody seems satisfied now with the
share that each race has taken in it. I wish
my honourable f riend from Granville (Hon.
Mr. Choquette) would mnake speeches like
that which he has just -made te encourage
the sentiment that is growing more and
more in the province of Quebec. That
sentiment is sure te produce admirable
results, and, I hope, will iaIse obliterate
conmpletely the remnembrance of other
speeches which have had, unLbappily, a verY
diff erent'and f ar worse result, in times that
are past.
The suggestion that has, been made is a
wide one; may I be permitted te add te it
something ta little more specific? The new
chamber o! -the Senate, I understand, is toe
be aderned with large paintings. It will ne
deubt be a 6plendid chamber. 7It will stand
fer many years, perbaps for generations.
Why sheuld net the oppertunity be taken,
net merely te describe in writing, but te
illustrate, the heroism of the Canadians
in this war? Around the walls there ceuld
be hung paintings illustrating the dîfferent
episodes cf the war which have shed glory
on the nation. The Canadian seldiers could
be represented as they were fighting fer
their country, forgetting altogether the
differences that Ïhad divided them before
they went to the front, und that unbappily,
during the war, divided semne of their
people at home. They could he sbown doing
their duty enly, forgetting ail else. Pictures
such as these on the Walls would go down te
posterity as illustrations, -not on.ly o! the
way the nation had -done its duty in this
war, but aise of the nianner in wbich it
should continue te do its duty, forgetting
the petty racial and religieus differences

however composed-Scotch or Irish, English
or French, Piotestant or Catholie - one
people, Ioving their country and willing to,
sacrifice for it everything they hold dear in
thiq world, even to the last drop of their
blood. When we behold in our own legislative chamber the illustrations of the
example given to us"Jby our sons on the
field of battle, then, honourable gentlemen,
we shall blush whenever we are tempted
to use for our own selfish advantage the
petty differenoes that are 6o easily aroused
in this country whenever a question of
race or religion is, involved. It seems
to me it would be the best of al
illustrations to show our sons fighting side
by side, and dying side by side, for their
country. From it we as publie mien could
very well learn how to devote, our own efforts to the 'welfare of our country, forgetting, even though there might be some personal advantage in net forgettiug, our petty
differences, by which our country is always
the loser, and remembering that our country should always be the first consideration,
especially ini the minds of statesmen and of
those of us 'who have the right conception
of our duties as mexnbers ef this honourable Hoiise.
Hon. E. L. GIRROIR: Honourable gentlemen, T arn sure it, must be very gratifying
to every true Canadian to witness the growing unity of sentiment a.nd purpose -which
the speeches delivered this mnorning have
indicated. 1 agree entirely 'with what bas
been said as to the desirability of doing
something to record the deeds of heroism
that have been performed by Canadian soldiers at the front. I do net think, however, that we can ever raise ia monument
high enough to show te the world the greatness of the sacrifice that bas beeii made
by our brave Canadian boys. Their deeds
and their valour are such that ne records
or monuments can ever do full justice to
what they have accomplished. The name
of Canada can now neyer die, when one
reads the history of the brilliant werk and
the great self-sacrifice wbich have characterized the Canadian soldiers, both olficers
and men, in this conflict which is threatening the existence our liberty, our privileges
and our splendid institutions, whicb are
part of the heritage of this Empire and this
country.
It does not seein right that at this late
stage in the> session we shoiald take too
muoh, time in discussing niatters of this
kind. But I cannot help on this occasion
again expressing the hope whieh I expressed a few days ago, tihat the time is

the hope that the struggle through which
we have passed, the distress which bas been

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
gentleman bas forgotten to mention the
work that is being done by the Statistical
Branch of the Federal Government, which,
since war was declared, bas annually collected data from the various relief associations througbout the land, which have
done no mean work for the soldiers and
their dependents, and for the assistance
o! the war in Europe. This data will show,
I think, very creditable work done by the
population at large for the relief of suifering-s brought about by this war.

Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED anoved the
second reading of the Bila.
He sa.id: The object of this Bill is to
make provision that, if a by-election should
be brought on during «the war, we shall
revert to the Dominion Elections Act
under which seven days intervene 'between
the date of nomination and the date of the
election. Under the War-time jElections

of a by-election. That is te say, it would be
impossible to put, the Military Votera' Act

-Hon. Sir James Lougheed-was, received
fromn the House cf Gemmons and read the
first turne.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED moved the

He said: The Yukon election bas been
discussed exhaustively in the House cf
Gemmons, and we are alI more cr les
familiar with the facts. The object cf this
Bill is te permit-if the defeated candidate

Consequently it is proposed that sufficient

,Exce'ption cannet be taken to the first

This is on]y reasonable, in view of the
fact that the candidates in the Yukon election, as in other electoral districts of
Canada, represent respectively the Govern,ment and -the Opposition; and, aithougli the
candidates in the Yukon election were not
r:ominated on the saine date as candidates
in the general election throughoùt Canada,
the military electors voted either for the
'Governinent or for the Opposition. As the
rnajority of the votes were cast in favour
of the Governinent, who>se candidate is the
sitting member, no doubt should be thrown
'tipon the polling of the military electors,
las they have indicated their wish and their
'wvill in the rnarking of their ballots. This
is for the purpose of vai-idating that vote.
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK; 1 have only had
a few minutes te look at this Bill, which is
brought down in the dying hours of the session. 0f course, the Bill is one that the
other Chamber bas a great deal more to do
with than we have in this Senate Cha.mber.
1 might also termn this Bill a nice piece of
camouflage. The first, clause of the Bull, as
my honourable friend has said, gives te the
diefeated candidate an oppoiiunity of moving again-t the return made by the
General Returning Officer; but the other
House could easily have dons this without
any Bill of this lcind, had they corne te that
understanding either in the Cornmittee on
Privileges and Elections or when the question was brought up in the Hous. I do
not propose to Lake up the time of honourable gentlemen now in discussing this matter, because, as my honourable friend bas
gaid, everv- member of the Rouse is probably conversant withl what has happened.
1 look upon the introduction of this Bill as
ea very extraordinary procedure, and one
that I hardly think even my honourable,
friend can be very much in faveur of. 1
think the Governinent woulId have shown
very much better judgment had they

judge, as 1 understand, neyer came to a
decision upon the matter, and it was allowed
to stand. . Although the Government had
not taken over this railroad, t.hey wenit
ahead and spent money on it. In the year
11916 an appropriation of $4,000,00
was
paced in the Eetimates in connection with
this road, and the Governmeint, although
they have not taken over the road, have
epent some $400,000 for work on i.t. 1Ihave
been unablie to find any ground upon which
the Government were au+.horized tb apend
such a sumn of money on a raii-road
which they had not then in their possesojon.
In addition to this amounit we find in the
'Main Estimatea an amount of $900O to
be appropriated and spent on thie, road,
niaking a total of $1,300,O000 which. appar,ently the Government bas expended or is
about to expe!nd on the road. The ivho]e
transaction seems to me to be an extraord'inary one. 1 eannot undierstand why the
Government did not proceed under the -Act
that was passed in 1916 if they wanted to
tak-e over t.he road, and leave the Excheq'ier
Court to deal with the matter and corne to a
decision. At the present trne it looks ai
if the Goverunent had decided to override
that Act and deal 'with 1,hie matter by
siinply paying over the money. There Is
nothing 'ta show how the figures that are
given in this estimate are arrived at. It is
stated. that ibis road is to be, t.aken at a
public zale, but 1 do not know of anybody
outside of the Government who would be
ready to compete in the bidding for the
road. The Act of 1916 deait with two other
pieces of road besides this one. At the
tixne we were discussing that Act it %vas
represented that -those two other pieces of
road were paying properties, and would
bring in a return; but, according to this
estimate, as I re-ad it, those two roads are
left out altogether, and we are simply
dealing with the one road of 62.3 miles in
length. 1 draw particular attention to this
itemý in the Estimates because this 6eesion
we have been discussing the question of
the rights of the Senate with regard to
finance and public expenditure. I think it
is only right to protest against such items
as this, and other items to which I might
refer in these Estimat-es, being placed as
they are in the main Supply Bril.
We have also in the Supplemeai~tary Estimates item 380 dealing with a number of
railways wvhich are to be purchased by the
Government, and a further sumn of $200,000,
which is to be spent upon them. It does
not appear to me that those items should
be included in the general Supply Bill, as
Hon. Mr. BOSTOCK.

is done this time, and as was doue on former
occasions. 1 want to enter a strong protest
aga inst this procedure, because Î think
that the Senate owes to the country the
duty of assertiug ils right to have some
consideration shown it, and' that this House
should ho in position to inquire into the
causes of these expenditure6.
Although 1 do xîot want to take up more
time than is necmessary ut present, I havie
brought these matters to the attention of
the House in order that the membera of
the Senate should consider whether we are
not justified in protesting against such
items being p1aced in the annual Supply
Bill. Further than this I wilI not take up
the time of the House to-nîght. But I
protest against the method of bringing
down the Supply Bill at this late hour of
the session, when there is only a very
lîmited time to deal with it, and we cannot
properly consider the figures contained in
it.
Hon. Sir JAMES LOUGHEED: I do not
propose to occupy any length of time in
answering %ýhatmy honourable friend has
said. It is too late to follow the lamentations in which my honourable, friend has
indulged, and whieh are entirely without
warrant. To compare the expenditure of
Canada at the present time, when the
country is in a state of war, with what it
was under normal conditions previous to
1914, is simply trifling with the question
of criticism, and it would be a loss of time
to deal with a so-ca]led argument of that
character.
I will, however, take the liberty of pointing out to my honourable friend-afid I
hope he may oh'tain some satisfaction from
it-that as to item 383 in the Estimate6,
touching the Quebec and Saguenay railwray, the information was readily obtainable if he had made inquiry as to the
basis upon which this estimate is forrued.
'My honourable friend has referred to tme
istatute requiring a valuation te be placed
upon this railway by the Exohequer Court,
and it seems to me most commendable in
the Government that it bas been able to,
save a/pproximiately over a million and
three-quarters of dollars by reason of its
prosecution of that valuation before the
Exchequer Court. Although the company
claimied, as the cost of the ro-ad, some five
and a haif millions, and although Parlianment had given authority to the Government te acquire the road at a cost approximating four and a haîf millionsiHou. Mr. BOS1XYCK:

nUmbers on the Western front for the primary
purpose cf déstroying thé British armies and
with the ultimate ObJeet of gaining a décision
before reinforcements can arrive. In the face
of tremendous Odile the soldiers of our Empire
gshlantly supported by Our Alies, have wfthstood
thus asaault with a courage and tenacity which
commiand our admiration and gratitude. It is
anticipated that the attack will be renewed ln
still greater force and intensity during thé coinIng surmner and autumn.
Portions of the Canadian forces, already engaged ln Meeting thus attack, have rendered

Meanwhile arrangements for a national registration are being advanced, ln order that the.
hurnan power of thé Dominion, esPeclly such as

effectively organized to maintain the productive
capacity of the country, which la exceeded
ln importance only by Our military needs. For
the like purpose, action has been taken as a

Menures you have adavted for increasing thé
